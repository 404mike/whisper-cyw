Jean, what are your memories of the 1969 moon landing?</div><div id="00:00:11.520" class="transcript_line"> Well, the thing I remember was that it was all very, very exciting and everybody was wondering</div><div id="00:00:16.960" class="transcript_line"> whether a baby would be born on that day. My son was a week overdue and I&#039;d already started in</div><div id="00:00:24.080" class="transcript_line"> labour and I was like sitting there watching the moon landing wondering which thing was going to</div><div id="00:00:29.360" class="transcript_line"> happen first and in fact he wasn&#039;t born until the next day. But we met somebody a few years ago</div><div id="00:00:38.320" class="transcript_line"> who lived next door to us and that was all she remembered about living next door to us,</div><div id="00:00:44.640" class="transcript_line"> that we nearly had a baby born the day they landed on the moon and he&#039;s now of course 50</div><div id="00:00:50.800" class="transcript_line"> tomorrow. So he&#039;s having a party today. So that&#039;s really why I recorded it because it isn&#039;t particularly</div><div id="00:00:58.400" class="transcript_line"> exciting but it&#039;s just quite interesting of how excited everybody was at the time</div><div id="00:01:05.440" class="transcript_line"> because the papers were full of all these babies who were born on that day.</div><div id="00:01:10.240" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember anything about the fashion and the music at the time?</div><div id="00:01:14.880" class="transcript_line"> No, not really. I mean, I know miniskirts were in and there&#039;s a Mary Quant exhibition I think in</div><div id="00:01:21.760" class="transcript_line"> London but because I was very, very pregnant I wasn&#039;t really wearing a miniskirt.</div><div id="00:01:28.240" class="transcript_line"> So, Jean, that&#039;s brilliant. Thank you so much.</div><div id="00:01:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Thank you. Thanks very much.</div></div></p>
