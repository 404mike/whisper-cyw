    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Hello Steve, how are you? Do you want more time because I&#039;ve got all I&#039;m in no hurry.</div><div id="00:00:08.640" class="transcript_line"> No, no it&#039;s fine. The university just called an all-starved meeting about some finance</div><div id="00:00:18.280" class="transcript_line"> stuff which I didn&#039;t have in my diary when we organised this but to be honest I only</div><div id="00:00:22.560" class="transcript_line"> have a bowl of soup for lunch. That&#039;s all sorted out.</div><div id="00:00:27.120" class="transcript_line"> Do you know that the link you sent me? Oh yes, yeah. I don&#039;t know if that was written for an</div><div id="00:00:33.360" class="transcript_line"> academic audience but I found it really accessible. I mean that was the first book that I ever wrote.</div><div id="00:00:39.760" class="transcript_line"> Oh really? I&#039;ve never written in a jargon written way. I think it is a fair criticism of my work</div><div id="00:00:49.920" class="transcript_line"> that it&#039;s not the most theoretically incisive research. I don&#039;t do that kind of stuff.</div><div id="00:00:57.360" class="transcript_line"> I think that because pretty much all the work that I do is related to the landscape</div><div id="00:01:05.760" class="transcript_line"> that is kind of all around us so I think it&#039;s easy to write in a way and about things that</div><div id="00:01:10.480" class="transcript_line"> people can relate to rather than stuff that&#039;s buried in the ground or shards of pottery that</div><div id="00:01:19.520" class="transcript_line"> we dig up and get terribly excited by and so on. That is actually all a bit more abstract.</div><div id="00:01:25.040" class="transcript_line"> Yes, because it doesn&#039;t look like a pot does it?</div><div id="00:01:27.840" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:01:30.400" class="transcript_line"> Whereas if you&#039;re talking about the names of settlements or why fields of a particular</div><div id="00:01:36.560" class="transcript_line"> shape, anyone who lives in the countryside can think oh god yeah I can understand that now.</div><div id="00:01:41.760" class="transcript_line"> So I think I do work that is easier to communicate to people than lots of my colleagues who might</div><div id="00:01:49.520" class="transcript_line"> do more scientific research.</div><div id="00:01:51.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah. Where did you get them all from? Sorry I&#039;m going off on the tangent now.</div><div id="00:01:57.680" class="transcript_line"> This is the book titled The Gwent Levels.</div><div id="00:01:59.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, let me just check. The one you sent me.</div><div id="00:02:03.360" class="transcript_line"> Is now freely available online.</div><div id="00:02:05.200" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m just yeah the um sorry Steve you&#039;ve lost my faith but it is yeah The Gwent Levels,</div><div id="00:02:11.680" class="transcript_line"> the evolution of a wetland landscape.</div><div id="00:02:15.360" class="transcript_line"> Well that the history of that book I mean you I mean you will have heard talk of a gentleman</div><div id="00:02:22.800" class="transcript_line"> called Rick Turner.</div><div id="00:02:23.920" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:02:25.520" class="transcript_line"> Sadly died um um well Rick was he used to work for Caddo.</div><div id="00:02:31.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:32.240" class="transcript_line"> And he in the early 1990s he recognized that the Gwent Levels were threatened with development</div><div id="00:02:38.800" class="transcript_line"> and in particular the proposed diversion of the M4 south of people.</div><div id="00:02:43.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:44.400" class="transcript_line"> Now I back then I was a research student at Reading and I was doing my thesis on the reclamation</div><div id="00:02:51.600" class="transcript_line"> of the wetlands all around the southern estuary.</div><div id="00:02:54.720" class="transcript_line"> Why were you doing that? Why did you choose that?</div><div id="00:02:58.480" class="transcript_line"> Um the reason well looking back it&#039;s slightly odd that my undergraduate dissertation supervisor</div><div id="00:03:08.800" class="transcript_line"> was working with another colleague up in Gloucestershire.</div><div id="00:03:12.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:13.200" class="transcript_line"> Of the history of the reclamation so sort of the areas that Rose is more familiar with.</div><div id="00:03:17.440" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:03:19.040" class="transcript_line"> He just thought it would be interesting to have somebody look at Somerset and um</div><div id="00:03:23.120" class="transcript_line"> The Gwent Levels.</div><div id="00:03:24.160" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:03:24.960" class="transcript_line"> I wanted to do a PhD and so he sort of gently encouraged me to do that.</div><div id="00:03:29.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:31.040" class="transcript_line"> Um I started giving odd papers at conferences that Rick went to so he heard about my work.</div><div id="00:03:38.320" class="transcript_line"> Um in a way what I was doing was exactly what he wanted anyway um and I still remember we were</div><div id="00:03:46.480" class="transcript_line"> at a conference at you know St Fagans.</div><div id="00:03:48.880" class="transcript_line"> Yes yeah yeah.</div><div id="00:03:51.360" class="transcript_line"> And um after after we had a conference and then we would some of us were just wandering</div><div id="00:03:56.720" class="transcript_line"> around the outdoorsy bits and Rick sidled up to me.</div><div id="00:04:01.280" class="transcript_line"> Can I have a chat sort of thing.</div><div id="00:04:03.120" class="transcript_line"> What are you planning on doing after your PhD?</div><div id="00:04:06.480" class="transcript_line"> Um because he wanted a commission.</div><div id="00:04:09.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:09.360" class="transcript_line"> The Gwent Levels Historic Landscape Study.</div><div id="00:04:12.320" class="transcript_line"> Now of course for me I mean this was like somebody was offering me two years work.</div><div id="00:04:16.480" class="transcript_line"> And Rick jointly funded that with what was then called the Countryside Council for Wales.</div><div id="00:04:24.880" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:04:25.920" class="transcript_line"> CCW.</div><div id="00:04:26.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:27.360" class="transcript_line"> That is now it&#039;s morphed into Natural Resources Wales.</div><div id="00:04:31.120" class="transcript_line"> Okay yeah.</div><div id="00:04:32.880" class="transcript_line"> So they they they funded it 50 50.</div><div id="00:04:35.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah yeah.</div><div id="00:04:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was only part way through the project that I realised that it was partly funded because of</div><div id="00:04:46.880" class="transcript_line"> this threat of the M4 proposed M4 diversion.</div><div id="00:04:50.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah yeah.</div><div id="00:04:52.480" class="transcript_line"> Um and I haven&#039;t I haven&#039;t got this in writing.</div><div id="00:04:55.440" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d love to have this in writing but one of the early highlights of my career was I gave a paper</div><div id="00:05:01.600" class="transcript_line"> on my work to a group at the Welsh Office Highways.</div><div id="00:05:06.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:05:07.120" class="transcript_line"> And um once again this bloke came up to me afterwards and sort of said oh Dr Rippon very</div><div id="00:05:12.960" class="transcript_line"> nice to meet you you know very interested in your work.</div><div id="00:05:17.120" class="transcript_line"> Do you realise that you&#039;ve moved a motorway?</div><div id="00:05:21.360" class="transcript_line"> And he went on to explain that the work that I did was instrumental in shifting the original</div><div id="00:05:28.880" class="transcript_line"> proposed line of the motorway was to go right through the middle of Whitsun Goldcliff Nash.</div><div id="00:05:35.200" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:05:35.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:36.320" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:05:36.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:36.960" class="transcript_line"> So a very a route that went quite close to the coast.</div><div id="00:05:40.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:41.280" class="transcript_line"> And it was because I managed to sort of make the case for the the importance of this landscape.</div><div id="00:05:46.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:47.040" class="transcript_line"> That they moved it to the northern route.</div><div id="00:05:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:05:50.480" class="transcript_line"> Essentially along the southern side of the old steelworks.</div><div id="00:05:54.480" class="transcript_line"> How phenomenal.</div><div id="00:05:56.320" class="transcript_line"> So I know that I of course now the motorway is not going to be built anyway but um I haven&#039;t</div><div id="00:06:02.000" class="transcript_line"> got it in writing but it&#039;s there.</div><div id="00:06:03.920" class="transcript_line"> That doesn&#039;t matter.</div><div id="00:06:04.400" class="transcript_line"> It further confirms it as well.</div><div id="00:06:06.880" class="transcript_line"> What was Rick Turner like then?</div><div id="00:06:08.720" class="transcript_line"> Steve sorry I&#039;m recording this is that okay because I&#039;m going to transcribe it and I&#039;ll</div><div id="00:06:13.280" class="transcript_line"> send it to you afterwards but what was um Rick Turner like?</div><div id="00:06:17.760" class="transcript_line"> I mean he I mean he was lovely he um he was one of these people that&#039;s was quite quiet</div><div id="00:06:24.880" class="transcript_line"> doesn&#039;t necessarily doesn&#039;t sprout off and so on um no ego or anything like that just quietly</div><div id="00:06:31.280" class="transcript_line"> gets on with things and he was an absolute pleasure to work with um I mean he had a long</div><div id="00:06:37.840" class="transcript_line"> standing interest in wetlands.</div><div id="00:06:40.960" class="transcript_line"> Why?</div><div id="00:06:42.720" class="transcript_line"> He used to be the archaeologist at Cheshire County Council I think it was but he was an</div><div id="00:06:49.840" class="transcript_line"> archaeologist in Cheshire when um some gentlemen who were cutting peat found a preserved body</div><div id="00:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> and it was the body was called Lindow Man.</div><div id="00:07:00.480" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes.</div><div id="00:07:01.760" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s the best preserved what&#039;s called bog body.</div><div id="00:07:04.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:06.800" class="transcript_line"> And Rick was the first archaeologist kind of like on call who went out to see it.</div><div id="00:07:11.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:12.260" class="transcript_line"> And he sort of oversaw that project.</div><div id="00:07:15.520" class="transcript_line"> Then he got a job as an inspector of ancient monuments at Caddo.</div><div id="00:07:18.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:19.680" class="transcript_line"> But because of his particular interest in wetlands he was kind of given the seven estuary</div><div id="00:07:25.840" class="transcript_line"> as part of his job description as sort of like Caddo&#039;s man on the levels as it were.</div><div id="00:07:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:34.720" class="transcript_line"> So yeah I mean he was sort of knowledgeable about wetlands he absolutely saw the value of them.</div><div id="00:07:40.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:42.080" class="transcript_line"> And I think sort of without making it obvious I think he must have known that it was the first</div><div id="00:07:47.600" class="transcript_line"> time I&#039;d had a proper job.</div><div id="00:07:50.640" class="transcript_line"> And I know I didn&#039;t really I think when you&#039;re that young you possibly</div><div id="00:07:57.120" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t get worried about stuff as perhaps you do a little bit as you get older.</div><div id="00:08:01.600" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s true.</div><div id="00:08:02.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:02.660" class="transcript_line"> But he certainly helped guide me through some of the things or for some of the meetings needing</div><div id="00:08:09.120" class="transcript_line"> to produce certain sorts of documents and so on and so forth.</div><div id="00:08:12.240" class="transcript_line"> He gently guided and sort of supported me and so.</div><div id="00:08:16.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:17.600" class="transcript_line"> What remit did he give you then?</div><div id="00:08:20.240" class="transcript_line"> Sorry?</div><div id="00:08:20.880" class="transcript_line"> What remit did he give you?</div><div id="00:08:24.880" class="transcript_line"> It was agreed that I had to produce two reports.</div><div id="00:08:29.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:30.880" class="transcript_line"> One was going to be the published book which you&#039;ve read and the other one which I know</div><div id="00:08:40.080" class="transcript_line"> has been used a lot within planning departments and so on and so forth.</div><div id="00:08:48.000" class="transcript_line"> It was never formally published.</div><div id="00:08:49.600" class="transcript_line"> It had a very limited print run.</div><div id="00:08:51.520" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:08:52.960" class="transcript_line"> And that gave like a little description of each character area on the levels.</div><div id="00:09:01.520" class="transcript_line"> If you think sort of the area around Nash and Goldcliff,</div><div id="00:09:05.280" class="transcript_line"> if you look at a map there&#039;s little settlements dotted about.</div><div id="00:09:08.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:08.960" class="transcript_line"> The fields quite small and fiddly.</div><div id="00:09:11.360" class="transcript_line"> I mean that&#039;s quite an old sort of medieval landscape.</div><div id="00:09:14.240" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s one character area.</div><div id="00:09:16.320" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:09:17.460" class="transcript_line"> And then you&#039;ve got, if you go further inland,</div><div id="00:09:20.740" class="transcript_line"> sort of south of the Hanwen still works, you&#039;ve got areas of long straight roads.</div><div id="00:09:27.220" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:09:27.720" class="transcript_line"> Very rectilinear fields.</div><div id="00:09:29.460" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:29.700" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s all no settlements actually.</div><div id="00:09:32.180" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s the latest area to have been drained and reclaimed.</div><div id="00:09:37.380" class="transcript_line"> It was farmed by farmers who lived elsewhere</div><div id="00:09:41.540" class="transcript_line"> because those parts of the levels would have been too wet to live in.</div><div id="00:09:44.740" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s a different character area.</div><div id="00:09:48.420" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:48.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:50.180" class="transcript_line"> What this second report did was divide the levels up into sort of these character areas</div><div id="00:09:56.180" class="transcript_line"> and write about them in turn.</div><div id="00:10:01.620" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s very much a companion volume to the one that you&#039;ve read.</div><div id="00:10:05.380" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve read the one that gives the big chronological, if you like, narrative.</div><div id="00:10:08.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:10.200" class="transcript_line"> The other really provided a lot of the detail about each area.</div><div id="00:10:14.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:15.480" class="transcript_line"> And is that available anywhere?</div><div id="00:10:17.720" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think it is.</div><div id="00:10:19.160" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:10:20.680" class="transcript_line"> No. I mean there were hundreds of copies printed.</div><div id="00:10:24.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:25.640" class="transcript_line"> But I know, I think they were all sort of snapped up really quite quickly.</div><div id="00:10:31.160" class="transcript_line"> I think I&#039;ve got two copies left, one at home and one in the office at work.</div><div id="00:10:36.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:37.100" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the sort of thing now that would look terribly dated because of course it was done</div><div id="00:10:43.340" class="transcript_line"> on my little Mac computer rather than proper desktop publishing and so forth.</div><div id="00:10:50.780" class="transcript_line"> Nowadays, of course, something like that would at least be made freely available as a PDF.</div><div id="00:10:55.020" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:56.060" class="transcript_line"> But when the project started in 1993, there was no email.</div><div id="00:11:03.980" class="transcript_line"> So hard to think of.</div><div id="00:11:05.820" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if I had a mobile.</div><div id="00:11:09.180" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think I did back then.</div><div id="00:11:10.460" class="transcript_line"> So it was a very, very different world.</div><div id="00:11:14.940" class="transcript_line"> That was my remit was to produce those two reports.</div><div id="00:11:21.340" class="transcript_line"> But I say I know through talking to Rick that by the end of the project, I was aware</div><div id="00:11:28.860" class="transcript_line"> that actually the big remit was to produce a report that would try and move this road</div><div id="00:11:35.740" class="transcript_line"> and stop this road from going right through the middle of the levels.</div><div id="00:11:40.940" class="transcript_line"> Off the record, you did.</div><div id="00:11:44.380" class="transcript_line"> Which I did until they decided not to build it at all.</div><div id="00:11:48.620" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:11:52.620" class="transcript_line"> Steve, I&#039;ve got some questions but I might,</div><div id="00:11:55.420" class="transcript_line"> but I wonder if you could just start.</div><div id="00:11:58.300" class="transcript_line"> This might seem a bit basic to me.</div><div id="00:11:59.740" class="transcript_line"> If you can just introduce yourself and your specialism and</div><div id="00:12:06.860" class="transcript_line"> your involvement with the grant levels and with the levels project.</div><div id="00:12:11.500" class="transcript_line"> The living levels project.</div><div id="00:12:12.300" class="transcript_line"> Living levels project, yeah.</div><div id="00:12:15.340" class="transcript_line"> Well, as I say, I am a professor of landscape archaeology at the University of Exeter.</div><div id="00:12:21.500" class="transcript_line"> And my interest in the wetlands around the Severn Estuary goes back to my PhD.</div><div id="00:12:27.740" class="transcript_line"> That was a study of both sides of the estuary and it looked at the changing ways that human</div><div id="00:12:34.700" class="transcript_line"> communities exploited the rich natural resources of these wetlands.</div><div id="00:12:40.940" class="transcript_line"> And then gradually started to intensify how they used the wetlands.</div><div id="00:12:47.980" class="transcript_line"> Rather than just hunting and fishing, they started grazing their livestock,</div><div id="00:12:53.820" class="transcript_line"> in banking the land, using it for arable farming and so on.</div><div id="00:12:57.180" class="transcript_line"> And I looked at that over the Roman and the medieval periods.</div><div id="00:13:02.460" class="transcript_line"> Then I got the job doing the grant levels historic landscape study that we talked about.</div><div id="00:13:10.380" class="transcript_line"> That was from 1993 to 1995.</div><div id="00:13:15.580" class="transcript_line"> Then I got a government funded fellowship to do a comparison of wetland use all the way around</div><div id="00:13:23.500" class="transcript_line"> Britain and North West Europe.</div><div id="00:13:26.140" class="transcript_line"> And then I got the lectureship at the University of Exeter.</div><div id="00:13:28.460" class="transcript_line"> Oh wow.</div><div id="00:13:31.020" class="transcript_line"> Ever since.</div><div id="00:13:32.460" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:13:34.140" class="transcript_line"> And I think, I mean, what I try to do in my work is to sort of cross boundaries.</div><div id="00:13:41.820" class="transcript_line"> So I love using archaeological evidence, maps, written documents that I can access.</div><div id="00:13:51.580" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t read medieval Latin or anything.</div><div id="00:13:55.020" class="transcript_line"> But I can read sort of 17th century handwriting onwards and so on.</div><div id="00:13:59.900" class="transcript_line"> So I love looking at some of the old documents interpreting place names and so on.</div><div id="00:14:03.900" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:04.860" class="transcript_line"> So I try to be very interdisciplinary.</div><div id="00:14:07.100" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:08.060" class="transcript_line"> Is that unusual?</div><div id="00:14:09.980" class="transcript_line"> Sorry?</div><div id="00:14:10.300" class="transcript_line"> Is that unusual?</div><div id="00:14:13.900" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not unusual for a relatively small group that would call themselves landscape archaeologists.</div><div id="00:14:21.020" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:22.380" class="transcript_line"> It is to my eternal frustration, and don&#039;t write this down,</div><div id="00:14:26.140" class="transcript_line"> but too many archaeologists and too many historians, for example, will only study one thing.</div><div id="00:14:34.140" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:34.860" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:35.180" class="transcript_line"> No, they will do is study place names.</div><div id="00:14:39.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:40.300" class="transcript_line"> Or all they will study is pottery.</div><div id="00:14:44.540" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:46.860" class="transcript_line"> Or they&#039;re only really interested in burial sites, not the wider landscape.</div><div id="00:14:53.820" class="transcript_line"> All they do is study burials and so on.</div><div id="00:14:56.140" class="transcript_line"> And then you miss context then, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:14:58.780" class="transcript_line"> You lose context.</div><div id="00:14:59.660" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:00.220" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:01.420" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s often said about landscape archaeology is that you&#039;re a jack of all trades and a master of none.</div><div id="00:15:08.220" class="transcript_line"> And that is true.</div><div id="00:15:11.900" class="transcript_line"> There are people out there that know a darn sight more about place names than I do.</div><div id="00:15:17.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:18.540" class="transcript_line"> But I know a darn sight more about landscapes than place names experts do.</div><div id="00:15:23.740" class="transcript_line"> So to the uninitiated, what is a landscape historian?</div><div id="00:15:28.620" class="transcript_line"> Well, I mean, you can use it in two senses.</div><div id="00:15:32.060" class="transcript_line"> Well, landscape archaeologists, sorry.</div><div id="00:15:35.020" class="transcript_line"> All right, yeah.</div><div id="00:15:35.660" class="transcript_line"> I mean, in a sense, I would say a landscape archaeologist is a landscape historian.</div><div id="00:15:42.540" class="transcript_line"> In the sense of somebody who&#039;s trying to write the story of a landscape.</div><div id="00:15:47.100" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:47.500" class="transcript_line"> But the normal meaning of landscape history is only to study documents.</div><div id="00:15:52.940" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:15:54.540" class="transcript_line"> What distinguishes archaeology is that you study physical remains.</div><div id="00:16:00.140" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:01.360" class="transcript_line"> So archaeology is studying the past through its material remains.</div><div id="00:16:06.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:07.200" class="transcript_line"> Those would be things that you dig from beneath the ground.</div><div id="00:16:11.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:12.400" class="transcript_line"> Right the way through to what I tend to focus in on, what we would call the historic landscape.</div><div id="00:16:17.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:18.640" class="transcript_line"> Which is the present day patterns of fields and roads and settlements and land uses</div><div id="00:16:27.040" class="transcript_line"> that although they&#039;re in use today, can be 100 years old,</div><div id="00:16:32.720" class="transcript_line"> a thousand years old, or they can be 2000 years old.</div><div id="00:16:36.400" class="transcript_line"> So they&#039;re above ground.</div><div id="00:16:38.400" class="transcript_line"> Above ground.</div><div id="00:16:39.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:40.160" class="transcript_line"> So on the Gwent levels, quite a lot of those rings and the field boundary ditches</div><div id="00:16:49.280" class="transcript_line"> are medieval in date.</div><div id="00:16:51.280" class="transcript_line"> So they probably are about 800 years old.</div><div id="00:16:54.160" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:16:55.360" class="transcript_line"> If you go to the far west of Cornwall, have you ever been on holiday to Pennsance or St Ives?</div><div id="00:17:02.880" class="transcript_line"> I am walking there this summer actually on the coastal path.</div><div id="00:17:07.760" class="transcript_line"> Well, well if you do the coastal path around West Penn with.</div><div id="00:17:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:13.280" class="transcript_line"> Okay. Pass Lands End.</div><div id="00:17:15.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:15.940" class="transcript_line"> If you do that stretch.</div><div id="00:17:17.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:18.080" class="transcript_line"> In places you will be walking through field systems, field boundaries.</div><div id="00:17:23.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:23.920" class="transcript_line"> That are at least 2000 years old.</div><div id="00:17:26.800" class="transcript_line"> Why, really?</div><div id="00:17:27.920" class="transcript_line"> So what should one be looking for?</div><div id="00:17:33.360" class="transcript_line"> This is where if we were meeting face to face, I could draw you a sketch.</div><div id="00:17:37.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:39.200" class="transcript_line"> What we all find is that,</div><div id="00:17:45.280" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ve got a hillside that&#039;s on a slope.</div><div id="00:17:47.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:47.780" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:17:50.640" class="transcript_line"> The slope isn&#039;t smooth.</div><div id="00:17:53.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:17:54.800" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s stepped.</div><div id="00:17:56.640" class="transcript_line"> Okay. Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And where it is stepped is where you&#039;ve got a field boundary.</div><div id="00:18:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:04.240" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:18:04.740" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:05.240" class="transcript_line"> If the field is ploughed.</div><div id="00:18:06.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:07.380" class="transcript_line"> Over many, many hundreds of years.</div><div id="00:18:09.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:10.160" class="transcript_line"> Soil gets washed down slope.</div><div id="00:18:13.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:14.160" class="transcript_line"> Okay. And it builds up behind these field boundaries which are stone, rubble and earth and banks.</div><div id="00:18:21.520" class="transcript_line"> Okay. Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:24.320" class="transcript_line"> This sort of, so the fields literally they have like a stepped profile.</div><div id="00:18:29.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:29.780" class="transcript_line"> As you go down.</div><div id="00:18:31.040" class="transcript_line"> And there have been archaeological excavations of these field boundaries, a dating of them.</div><div id="00:18:38.800" class="transcript_line"> And they go back around about 2000 years.</div><div id="00:18:42.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s extraordinary.</div><div id="00:18:44.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s absolutely extraordinary.</div><div id="00:18:45.760" class="transcript_line"> Isn&#039;t it? Oh my gosh.</div><div id="00:18:47.920" class="transcript_line"> I mean those fields in that West Penwith region are pretty unique.</div><div id="00:18:54.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. How have they survived all this time?</div><div id="00:18:58.880" class="transcript_line"> Almost certainly in continuous use.</div><div id="00:19:01.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:02.800" class="transcript_line"> I mean it&#039;s, it is astonishing to think.</div><div id="00:19:06.080" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:19:07.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:08.720" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, it&#039;s a very, very special landscape.</div><div id="00:19:11.760" class="transcript_line"> So do you identify it from ground level or do you need to be using a drone or flying over a landscape?</div><div id="00:19:21.360" class="transcript_line"> Well there&#039;s sort of two different approaches.</div><div id="00:19:24.000" class="transcript_line"> The specifics of those West Penwith field systems, that really, I mean it&#039;s obvious on the ground.</div><div id="00:19:31.040" class="transcript_line"> As you look around that landscape.</div><div id="00:19:32.560" class="transcript_line"> If you know what you&#039;re looking for.</div><div id="00:19:33.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:35.200" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got these very distinctive sort of stepped profiles down.</div><div id="00:19:40.800" class="transcript_line"> Sorry.</div><div id="00:19:41.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:41.600" class="transcript_line"> That means that those fields have been ploughed for hundreds and hundreds of years.</div><div id="00:19:46.160" class="transcript_line"> The soil has gradually got washed down and accumulated behind these banks.</div><div id="00:19:51.920" class="transcript_line"> So you really need to be in the field.</div><div id="00:19:53.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:55.120" class="transcript_line"> Where you&#039;ve got the Gwent levels.</div><div id="00:19:59.200" class="transcript_line"> The work I did there fundamentally is trying to understand the shapes of the fields.</div><div id="00:20:05.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:06.320" class="transcript_line"> And you do that really from just from maps.</div><div id="00:20:09.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:10.200" class="transcript_line"> But to somebody who&#039;s not an archaeologist and you say understand the shapes of fields,</div><div id="00:20:14.840" class="transcript_line"> somebody might say, so what?</div><div id="00:20:17.080" class="transcript_line"> You know, what does the shape of field tell you?</div><div id="00:20:21.640" class="transcript_line"> Different morphologies of fields.</div><div id="00:20:23.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:25.280" class="transcript_line"> Are often created through different processes.</div><div id="00:20:29.120" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:20:29.620" class="transcript_line"> So for example, different land uses.</div><div id="00:20:33.640" class="transcript_line"> So if you&#039;ve got very long, narrow fields.</div><div id="00:20:38.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:39.360" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re like little strips of land.</div><div id="00:20:41.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:42.920" class="transcript_line"> That is indicative of land that used to be in one enormous field.</div><div id="00:20:48.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:49.800" class="transcript_line"> It was divided up into strips.</div><div id="00:20:53.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:54.400" class="transcript_line"> As a way of distributing the land equally amongst all members of the community.</div><div id="00:21:01.440" class="transcript_line"> Is that strip grazing?</div><div id="00:21:05.440" class="transcript_line"> Is it really called strip grazing or is that something different?</div><div id="00:21:08.660" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. I don&#039;t know the phrase strip grazing.</div><div id="00:21:11.700" class="transcript_line"> Okay. I&#039;ve heard it here in Herefordshire. So yeah, maybe I&#039;m getting it wrong.</div><div id="00:21:16.980" class="transcript_line"> I think that might be something different.</div><div id="00:21:18.580" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:19.500" class="transcript_line"> It would either be used as arable land for grazing, for growing crops.</div><div id="00:21:24.860" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:26.060" class="transcript_line"> Or it could be used as meadow.</div><div id="00:21:28.460" class="transcript_line"> Okay. Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:29.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:30.020" class="transcript_line"> And what would happen each year is that all of those strips would be distributed to each</div><div id="00:21:39.040" class="transcript_line"> member of the community.</div><div id="00:21:40.040" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:21:40.540" class="transcript_line"> So if you&#039;re quite a big land owner, you might get five strips.</div><div id="00:21:46.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:46.700" class="transcript_line"> If you were a relatively lowly peasant, you might only get one strip.</div><div id="00:21:50.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:51.260" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:52.740" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re sometimes called dole moors.</div><div id="00:21:58.180" class="transcript_line"> Moor is simply the old English word for a wet boggy landscape.</div><div id="00:22:02.660" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:03.160" class="transcript_line"> But dole, we are of the generation that remembers the word dole.</div><div id="00:22:08.860" class="transcript_line"> As in D-O-L-E you mean?</div><div id="00:22:11.580" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:12.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:12.580" class="transcript_line"> As in the unemployment benefit.</div><div id="00:22:15.580" class="transcript_line"> Oh my goodness. Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:17.800" class="transcript_line"> And the reason is, the common root of it is to dole out is to distribute.</div><div id="00:22:25.320" class="transcript_line"> Okay. Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:22:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So the old almost slang phrase for the dole, being on the dole, comes from this root of</div><div id="00:22:36.600" class="transcript_line"> this word which means and for an organization to distribute something.</div><div id="00:22:41.400" class="transcript_line"> Ah, ah, okay.</div><div id="00:22:43.400" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s why they&#039;re known as dole moors.</div><div id="00:22:47.220" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re wet boggy landscapes divided up into strips and they are distributed out to members</div><div id="00:22:54.180" class="transcript_line"> of the community.</div><div id="00:22:55.180" class="transcript_line"> Do you know, you said you arrived in, was it the early 90s to do your, so was it the</div><div id="00:23:03.340" class="transcript_line"> case that before then that it was an area that was overlooked as having this rich architectural,</div><div id="00:23:10.700" class="transcript_line"> archaeological potential?</div><div id="00:23:12.700" class="transcript_line"> Was it?</div><div id="00:23:15.680" class="transcript_line"> The, hang on, can I just quickly, hang on.</div><div id="00:23:19.680" class="transcript_line"> Um, what, there&#039;d been a huge amount of work done on the prehistoric archeology.</div><div id="00:23:29.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:30.200" class="transcript_line"> Of the Severnestri wetlands.</div><div id="00:23:32.200" class="transcript_line"> So this is sort of pre-Roman evidence.</div><div id="00:23:36.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:37.200" class="transcript_line"> And a huge amount of work had been done on that.</div><div id="00:23:40.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:41.700" class="transcript_line"> What we knew far less of was what was going on in the Roman and the medieval periods.</div><div id="00:23:47.700" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s partly why my PhD supervisor started looking at this up in Gloucestershire.</div><div id="00:23:55.700" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:23:56.700" class="transcript_line"> And then suggested that I looked at it for my PhD.</div><div id="00:24:01.700" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:02.700" class="transcript_line"> Um, in Somerset and in, in the, in the Gwent levels.</div><div id="00:24:05.700" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:24:07.200" class="transcript_line"> I was quite lucky to be almost in the right place at the right time.</div><div id="00:24:11.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:12.200" class="transcript_line"> Um, it&#039;s, it&#039;s when there was increasing interest in, in wetlands and a realisation</div><div id="00:24:18.200" class="transcript_line"> how important wetlands were.</div><div id="00:24:20.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:21.200" class="transcript_line"> We knew about the remarkably well-preserved remains in the wetlands.</div><div id="00:24:28.200" class="transcript_line"> Mm.</div><div id="00:24:29.200" class="transcript_line"> Beneath the surface.</div><div id="00:24:30.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:31.700" class="transcript_line"> And nobody really looked at sort of the history of the modern, the modern, the present-day</div><div id="00:24:38.200" class="transcript_line"> landscape and how old that was.</div><div id="00:24:40.200" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:24:41.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:42.200" class="transcript_line"> And so doing that was the sort of thing that I was interested in.</div><div id="00:24:45.200" class="transcript_line"> And I was just very fortunate that my PhD supervisor suggested that I looked at a landscape</div><div id="00:24:52.700" class="transcript_line"> that suddenly was going to become politically quite important, as it were, in terms of the</div><div id="00:25:00.500" class="transcript_line"> proposed route of this road.</div><div id="00:25:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was in the-</div><div id="00:25:04.000" class="transcript_line"> But what&#039;s the area though?</div><div id="00:25:05.000" class="transcript_line"> The Cowdercott and the Gwent Luke levels.</div><div id="00:25:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean it&#039;s huge, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:25:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Huge area of study.</div><div id="00:25:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Um, well that&#039;s actually quite small compared to the Somerset levels.</div><div id="00:25:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:25:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:25:16.000" class="transcript_line"> The Somerset levels are even bigger.</div><div id="00:25:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Is that because they&#039;re on the Windward side or is that because-</div><div id="00:25:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Is that because they&#039;re on the Windward side or we are the-</div><div id="00:25:27.000" class="transcript_line"> No, it&#039;s just the-</div><div id="00:25:28.500" class="transcript_line"> Actually, that is quite different.</div><div id="00:25:30.500" class="transcript_line"> The Gwent levels, you&#039;ve got this area of former salt marsh-</div><div id="00:25:36.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:37.500" class="transcript_line"> That formed going out from the coast.</div><div id="00:25:39.500" class="transcript_line"> On the Somerset side of the estuary, what you&#039;ve actually got are, if you like, a series</div><div id="00:25:48.000" class="transcript_line"> of former valleys that were flooded by rising sea level.</div><div id="00:25:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So, um, have you ever driven down the M5 from Bristol to say as far as Taunton?</div><div id="00:26:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:26:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:26:04.000" class="transcript_line"> You might, now I explain to you, you&#039;ll go, ah yes.</div><div id="00:26:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, you&#039;re leaving, you&#039;ve crossed the River Avon.</div><div id="00:26:12.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:26:13.500" class="transcript_line"> Okay, and you go along that slightly frightening bit where the M5 is terraced into the coast.</div><div id="00:26:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:26:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:26:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:26:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Then you go down a slope and you drive across what are known as the North Somerset levels.</div><div id="00:26:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, I wasn&#039;t aware of that, but yes.</div><div id="00:26:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Flat bit.</div><div id="00:26:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:26:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Huge wetland.</div><div id="00:26:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Then you come to the Western Supermare Junction.</div><div id="00:26:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:26:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you go through another cutting.</div><div id="00:26:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:26:37.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s cut into rock.</div><div id="00:26:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Hmm.</div><div id="00:26:39.000" class="transcript_line"> You go out the other side, you then go across another flat bit.</div><div id="00:26:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Um, and then you go, when you get to near Bridgewater, you go into another sort of cutting.</div><div id="00:26:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:26:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s because the motorway is cutting through ridges of high ground between the</div><div id="00:26:58.000" class="transcript_line"> low-lying wetlands.</div><div id="00:27:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, okay, yeah.</div><div id="00:27:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s very different to the Welsh side where you&#039;ve just got this one big sort of like</div><div id="00:27:07.000" class="transcript_line"> coastal marshland.</div><div id="00:27:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Hmm.</div><div id="00:27:09.000" class="transcript_line"> In Somerset, you&#039;ve got flat wetlands between ridges of high ground.</div><div id="00:27:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:27:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So would you say, so say, um, say the work of Martin Bell, for example, could I say that&#039;s</div><div id="00:27:28.000" class="transcript_line"> micro-archaeology and what yours is doing is macro?</div><div id="00:27:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Um, well, um, sort of.</div><div id="00:27:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:27:42.000" class="transcript_line"> To be honest, I can see exactly where you&#039;re coming from.</div><div id="00:27:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Martin is an archaeologist who sees the landscape more than some of his prehistoric colleagues,</div><div id="00:27:55.000" class="transcript_line"> should we say.</div><div id="00:27:56.000" class="transcript_line"> But yes, Martin&#039;s research focuses on field work in specific places.</div><div id="00:28:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:28:03.000" class="transcript_line"> There was, I don&#039;t get obsessed with one particular place, I look at the landscape as a whole.</div><div id="00:28:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:28:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;re getting the context of that area and how it all links and works with each other</div><div id="00:28:15.000" class="transcript_line"> and relates to each other.</div><div id="00:28:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:28:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:28:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So I suppose, yes, sort of traditional field archaeology, you could say is micro.</div><div id="00:28:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:28:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And a more landscape oriented approach is more sort of macro.</div><div id="00:28:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:28:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Um, I wouldn&#039;t say one is better or more important than the other.</div><div id="00:28:35.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re different and they&#039;re therefore sort of complementary.</div><div id="00:28:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they feed into each other, I would say.</div><div id="00:28:41.000" class="transcript_line"> You work together.</div><div id="00:28:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:28:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Um, I&#039;ve got, I might jump around a bit, Steve.</div><div id="00:28:48.000" class="transcript_line"> How long have you got, by the way?</div><div id="00:28:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Um, probably, we&#039;re probably around for another half an hour or so.</div><div id="00:28:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I&#039;ll, sorry, I get distracted easily.</div><div id="00:28:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Um, so, um, Professor John Allen&#039;s name has come up.</div><div id="00:29:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you know him?</div><div id="00:29:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:29:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, do you remember when I said about my PhD supervisor pushing me in this direction?</div><div id="00:29:09.000" class="transcript_line"> He was a chap called Mike Falford.</div><div id="00:29:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:29:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So, um, he, and I did mention that there was a, he had a colleague.</div><div id="00:29:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:29:18.000" class="transcript_line"> That was John Allen.</div><div id="00:29:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="00:29:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, yeah.</div><div id="00:29:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So those were the two who were working on the Gloucestershire wetlands at the time.</div><div id="00:29:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, okay.</div><div id="00:29:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Um, so, um, John didn&#039;t, he wasn&#039;t one of my PhD supervisors, but I worked with John</div><div id="00:29:34.000" class="transcript_line"> on, on various things over the years.</div><div id="00:29:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Um, I mean, he was a remarkable man.</div><div id="00:29:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Um, once again, quite quiet and modest and so on.</div><div id="00:29:46.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d never stand in meetings spouting off like some people do.</div><div id="00:29:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:29:52.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, he was a lovely man, very quiet, but just so knowledgeable across so many fields.</div><div id="00:29:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Was he a geologist?</div><div id="00:29:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, he, his background was as a geologist.</div><div id="00:30:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Um, he&#039;s, he once, he once explained to me how he wanted to spend about 10 years on a</div><div id="00:30:17.000" class="transcript_line"> particular research topic and then move on.</div><div id="00:30:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:30:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So he did a huge amount of work on, it was a particular geological period, and I can&#039;t</div><div id="00:30:29.000" class="transcript_line"> remember what it was.</div><div id="00:30:30.000" class="transcript_line"> It was, but tens of millions of years ago.</div><div id="00:30:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:30:36.000" class="transcript_line"> What some back sort of period.</div><div id="00:30:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow, yeah.</div><div id="00:30:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was like the world&#039;s expert on that.</div><div id="00:30:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Cool.</div><div id="00:30:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And then he decided, then I think he did something else.</div><div id="00:30:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember what that was.</div><div id="00:30:46.000" class="transcript_line"> He might have got into some type of fossil.</div><div id="00:30:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:30:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But then he got interested in salt marshes.</div><div id="00:30:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:30:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So instead of something that was tens of millions of years old.</div><div id="00:30:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:30:59.000" class="transcript_line"> He was interested in salt marshes that are only a few hundred or a few thousand years</div><div id="00:31:04.000" class="transcript_line"> old.</div><div id="00:31:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:31:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And he started to study the salt marshes around the Severn Estuary as a way of studying sea</div><div id="00:31:12.000" class="transcript_line"> level change.</div><div id="00:31:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, yeah.</div><div id="00:31:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Now he, the most amazing eye.</div><div id="00:31:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:31:20.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d be out in the field and you&#039;d be talking to him, walking along and he&#039;d go off on a</div><div id="00:31:26.000" class="transcript_line"> tangent because he&#039;d seen something 20 meters away.</div><div id="00:31:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow, yeah.</div><div id="00:31:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So he started to find bits of pottery.</div><div id="00:31:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:31:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Salt marshes that he was studying.</div><div id="00:31:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Thought it looked old.</div><div id="00:31:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So of course he took it to the archaeology department at Reading.</div><div id="00:31:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Met Mike Falford.</div><div id="00:31:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:31:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Mike had a quick look at this pottery, said it was Roman.</div><div id="00:31:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:31:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how their lifelong collaboration started.</div><div id="00:31:55.000" class="transcript_line"> How amazing.</div><div id="00:31:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So he only died recently, didn&#039;t he, I think?</div><div id="00:32:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So he was a member of this, is it Severn Estuary levels research committee that you&#039;re on?</div><div id="00:32:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Back in the early to mid 1980s, so we&#039;re going back a long way now, there was a proposal</div><div id="00:32:26.000" class="transcript_line"> to build a barrage across the Severn Estuary.</div><div id="00:32:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Have you heard of that?</div><div id="00:32:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:32:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Now that would have had huge implications for lots of things, including the archaeology.</div><div id="00:32:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So some of the archaeologists who were working in and around the estuary back in the 1980s</div><div id="00:32:47.000" class="transcript_line"> got together to establish what they call the Severn Estuary levels research committee.</div><div id="00:32:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:32:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Now the Severn barrage proposal disappeared relatively quickly.</div><div id="00:33:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Because it basically would be so phenomenally expensive.</div><div id="00:33:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:08.000" class="transcript_line"> It didn&#039;t get going.</div><div id="00:33:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think it did, it stimulated this sort of group of archaeologists to stay together</div><div id="00:33:17.000" class="transcript_line"> with this, it&#039;s a relatively informal little sort of research group.</div><div id="00:33:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And so to say, I became a member of it when I started my PhD in 1989.</div><div id="00:33:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:33:31.000" class="transcript_line"> When my recollection is that the threat of the barrage had largely passed, I think.</div><div id="00:33:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But I mean, John Allen was very, very active back then studying his salt marshes and he&#039;d</div><div id="00:33:47.000" class="transcript_line"> got interested in sort of medieval reclamation and so on.</div><div id="00:33:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Martin had done some work at Breeing Down on the Somerset side of the estuary.</div><div id="00:33:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:34:00.000" class="transcript_line"> He, I think, was now getting interested on the Welsh side.</div><div id="00:34:04.000" class="transcript_line"> There was another remarkable figure in the history of the levels, was a chap called Derek</div><div id="00:34:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Upton.</div><div id="00:34:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, I was going to ask you about him.</div><div id="00:34:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:34:15.000" class="transcript_line"> He worked at the steelworks and he was a bird watcher.</div><div id="00:34:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s somebody else with the most amazing eye.</div><div id="00:34:23.000" class="transcript_line"> He started seeing strange things.</div><div id="00:34:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:34:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Seeing objects, seeing things in the intertidal area of the estuary.</div><div id="00:34:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:34:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know who he first reported his finds to.</div><div id="00:34:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure.</div><div id="00:34:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:34:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But once again, quite quickly, he got to know various archaeologists and people that he</div><div id="00:34:45.000" class="transcript_line"> could report his finds to.</div><div id="00:34:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:34:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And took him seriously as well, I suppose.</div><div id="00:34:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Sorry?</div><div id="00:34:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And also who took him seriously.</div><div id="00:34:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:34:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that was the key thing.</div><div id="00:34:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:34:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So he was spotting little woven fish baskets and so on.</div><div id="00:35:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I think he might have discovered some of the first human footprints.</div><div id="00:35:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:35:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, Martin Bell has spent a lot of his time studying human footprints.</div><div id="00:35:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And so on.</div><div id="00:35:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So there was this sort of, it&#039;s just very fortuitous.</div><div id="00:35:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I think a lot of people sort of being around the estuary and then suddenly being drawn</div><div id="00:35:28.000" class="transcript_line"> in by this particular threat.</div><div id="00:35:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And then kind of sticking together once that threat had gone, simply because it&#039;s a remarkable</div><div id="00:35:39.000" class="transcript_line"> landscape to research.</div><div id="00:35:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s raised its profile, I suppose, as well.</div><div id="00:35:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So does it have any statutory protection?</div><div id="00:35:48.000" class="transcript_line"> It does for its nature conservation interests.</div><div id="00:35:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, both sides of the estuary are relatively well protected in terms of habitat, ecology</div><div id="00:36:01.000" class="transcript_line"> related protection.</div><div id="00:36:03.000" class="transcript_line"> But unfortunately, there&#039;s not really anything big and powerful on the statutory front that</div><div id="00:36:10.000" class="transcript_line"> protects it from solar farms, et cetera.</div><div id="00:36:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:36:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So no, my feeling is that our special landscapes don&#039;t have enough legal protection.</div><div id="00:36:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:36:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;re seeing this on the grant levels.</div><div id="00:36:26.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re not going to be there in a few years&#039; time.</div><div id="00:36:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you not think so?</div><div id="00:36:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:36:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, no.</div><div id="00:36:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, they&#039;re building a solar farm at Whitsun.</div><div id="00:36:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Are they really?</div><div id="00:36:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know that.</div><div id="00:36:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s going ahead.</div><div id="00:36:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Why?</div><div id="00:36:41.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s posals for a huge one on the Wentlewg level.</div><div id="00:36:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, I&#039;ve heard that one.</div><div id="00:36:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:36:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s proposals for another one at Redwick.</div><div id="00:36:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And although solar farms don&#039;t permanently destroy a landscape, like housing development</div><div id="00:37:00.000" class="transcript_line"> or steelworks, for example, but they&#039;ll ruin the appearance.</div><div id="00:37:05.000" class="transcript_line"> No, there&#039;s no doubt about it.</div><div id="00:37:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And on the Gloucestershire side, once again, when you drive along the M4 from South Wales</div><div id="00:37:19.000" class="transcript_line"> to Bristol, you go over an equivalent wetland on the Bristol side of the estuary.</div><div id="00:37:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s just getting covered in massive industrial units.</div><div id="00:37:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I think there&#039;s a huge Amazon depot there, for example.</div><div id="00:37:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, wow.</div><div id="00:37:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I suppose it&#039;s happened in Whendlewg already, hasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:37:36.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, that has been subject to far more development than the Caldecott side.</div><div id="00:37:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But for you, I mean, has wetlands become your specialism, would you say?</div><div id="00:37:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was for, once again, probably sort of 10, 15 years or so.</div><div id="00:37:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I made a conscious decision to move on.</div><div id="00:38:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:38:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Simply because as an academic, it&#039;s very easy to almost get typecast, to use an acting analogy.</div><div id="00:38:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:38:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So I absolutely consciously decided, right, I&#039;m now going to start studying other things.</div><div id="00:38:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:38:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So I do quite a lot of work now.</div><div id="00:38:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I had a period in my life, a bit like John Allen said, you should spend 10 years on something and then move on.</div><div id="00:38:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a period when I did a lot of work on regional variation in landscape character.</div><div id="00:38:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So why is the Devon landscape so different to Northamptonshire?</div><div id="00:38:40.000" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="00:38:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And so.</div><div id="00:38:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:38:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I got very interested in what happened when Britain ceased to be part of the Roman Empire</div><div id="00:38:48.000" class="transcript_line"> and whether that was actually a really significant change or not.</div><div id="00:38:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So I had quite a, I had about 10 years studying that.</div><div id="00:38:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So the Dark Ages, you mean?</div><div id="00:39:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the start of what are traditionally called the Dark Ages.</div><div id="00:39:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I think a lot of us would suggest they weren&#039;t quite as dark as they used to be.</div><div id="00:39:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, what is traditionally seen as being the sort of almost like the end of civilisation in the Roman period.</div><div id="00:39:19.000" class="transcript_line"> But actually, I think my work hopefully shows that if you were just like a peasant farmer ploughing a few fields and tending a few sheep, not a lot actually changed.</div><div id="00:39:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So I spent a few years sort of studying that.</div><div id="00:39:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So I sort of I tried to move on from wetlands, not because I didn&#039;t enjoy studying them, but just because, you know, a typical academic career is about 40 years.</div><div id="00:39:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t think many academics want to spend 40 years studying exactly the same thing.</div><div id="00:39:52.000" class="transcript_line"> A change is always good, isn&#039;t it, I think?</div><div id="00:39:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but one of the reasons why I&#039;ve so enjoyed my involvement in the Living Levels project is that it has brought me back to a landscape that I studied so intensively for two years.</div><div id="00:40:08.000" class="transcript_line"> For two years, that was my whole life.</div><div id="00:40:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:40:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve done I do periodically return to some of these wetland landscapes just to do a little bit of work on something that I&#039;m interested in.</div><div id="00:40:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:40:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I asked before actually about how much if your work is reliant on aerial views.</div><div id="00:40:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you have to rely? Is that part of it for you?</div><div id="00:40:33.000" class="transcript_line"> A bit.</div><div id="00:40:34.000" class="transcript_line"> The bread and butter is looking at maps because they are available in such detail.</div><div id="00:40:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So what age do you go back to?</div><div id="00:40:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, there&#039;s good map coverage for the whole country from the 19th century.</div><div id="00:40:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:40:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So sort of middle of the 19th century, there&#039;s really detailed maps of pretty much the whole country.</div><div id="00:40:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:41:00.000" class="transcript_line"> But some areas there are some earlier maps as well.</div><div id="00:41:05.000" class="transcript_line"> OK, yeah.</div><div id="00:41:06.000" class="transcript_line"> The maps are earlier than aerial photographs.</div><div id="00:41:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And also aerial photographs, the earliest aerial photographs really from the 1940s.</div><div id="00:41:17.000" class="transcript_line"> OK, yeah.</div><div id="00:41:18.000" class="transcript_line"> But they&#039;re pretty fuzzy.</div><div id="00:41:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:41:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But there are there are places where, for example, earthworks, sort of humps and bumps,</div><div id="00:41:29.000" class="transcript_line"> they are they show up on aerial photographs from, say, the late 1940s.</div><div id="00:41:36.000" class="transcript_line"> But those earthworks now have been completely ploughed flat.</div><div id="00:41:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:41:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So so yeah, I think to understand the landscape, you&#039;ve really got to look at absolutely everything you&#039;ve got at your disposal.</div><div id="00:41:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:41:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Although I would say it&#039;s the maps that are the starting point.</div><div id="00:41:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:41:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, maps tell a story all on their own, don&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:41:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I love a map.</div><div id="00:42:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you use the oh, gosh, my name&#039;s gone, the the internal drainage board maps.</div><div id="00:42:07.000" class="transcript_line"> How far back do they go?</div><div id="00:42:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:42:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:42:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, the the earliest of the maps that show individual fields and buildings and so on are 1830 to 1831.</div><div id="00:42:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And those were the earliest maps that cover the whole of the grant levels.</div><div id="00:42:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And they are an absolutely remarkable source.</div><div id="00:42:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Are they?</div><div id="00:42:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So I mean, they were really the starting point of the mapping in my grant levels, historic landscape study.</div><div id="00:42:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:42:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Has there been a high point for you or, you know, punching the air moment for you in all your work down there?</div><div id="00:42:51.000" class="transcript_line"> On the levels?</div><div id="00:42:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:42:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, really.</div><div id="00:43:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Off the top of my head, I don&#039;t think I can.</div><div id="00:43:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I&#039;ve had various very memorable moments.</div><div id="00:43:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:43:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But I don&#039;t think there is quite one punching the air.</div><div id="00:43:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I do remember doing a survey of the intertidal area at Magor Pill.</div><div id="00:43:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:43:30.000" class="transcript_line"> With John Allen in February.</div><div id="00:43:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, God.</div><div id="00:43:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was bitterly cold.</div><div id="00:43:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And that absolutely tested my commitment to archaeology.</div><div id="00:43:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Cold and wet.</div><div id="00:43:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was that was awful from the conditions, but it was just fascinating.</div><div id="00:43:58.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, spending a week with the great man.</div><div id="00:44:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:44:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So interpreting all of this archaeology.</div><div id="00:44:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So I mean, that was that was a definite sort of highlight.</div><div id="00:44:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But yes, I haven&#039;t really got the air punching moment.</div><div id="00:44:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I should probably think of something when we sign off.</div><div id="00:44:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:44:20.000" class="transcript_line"> What about, I&#039;m not sure this is a silly question or not, but the work you do,</div><div id="00:44:28.000" class="transcript_line"> is it something that can be used by?</div><div id="00:44:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Let me think I don&#039;t ask this question as a way of informing the future.</div><div id="00:44:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Because that is what the great levels historic landscape study.</div><div id="00:44:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, that was all about.</div><div id="00:44:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And it did it fade through to another Caddo Countryside Council for Wales</div><div id="00:44:59.000" class="transcript_line"> initiative, which was to produce a register of historic landscapes in Wales.</div><div id="00:45:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:45:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And it identified 60 ish landscapes of particular historic importance in Wales,</div><div id="00:45:16.000" class="transcript_line"> one of which is the Gwent levels.</div><div id="00:45:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And so the Gwent levels was the first one of the landscapes in the register to see</div><div id="00:45:24.000" class="transcript_line"> this sort of really intensive study.</div><div id="00:45:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, I think that study really did sort of have an impact in terms of raising</div><div id="00:45:34.000" class="transcript_line"> the profile of the concept of how important still used landscapes are and the</div><div id="00:45:43.000" class="transcript_line"> time depth that they have.</div><div id="00:45:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was similar work that was done in England as well.</div><div id="00:45:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was a very exciting period to be sort of working in what at that time was a</div><div id="00:45:59.000" class="transcript_line"> really new and a really sort of innovative concept.</div><div id="00:46:03.000" class="transcript_line"> The archaeologists shouldn&#039;t just be grubbing about in the dirt, but archaeologists</div><div id="00:46:08.000" class="transcript_line"> should be appreciating the historic importance of the landscape all around us.</div><div id="00:46:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s something that we take for granted now.</div><div id="00:46:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But thinking back to that sort of early mid 1990s, very few archaeologists had any</div><div id="00:46:25.000" class="transcript_line"> interest at all in the historic age of fields that they walk through or roads that</div><div id="00:46:34.000" class="transcript_line"> they drive down.</div><div id="00:46:35.000" class="transcript_line"> They were just roads and fields.</div><div id="00:46:38.000" class="transcript_line"> They are actually often as old, if not older, than things that archaeologists grub</div><div id="00:46:44.000" class="transcript_line"> around in the dirt.</div><div id="00:46:45.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s so interesting.</div><div id="00:46:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Because like you said earlier, it&#039;s so relatable, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:46:50.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s so relatable.</div><div id="00:46:52.000" class="transcript_line"> What about have you had to, so you said you&#039;ve used maps and old documents, Doomsday</div><div id="00:47:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Book.</div><div id="00:47:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Have you ever used spoken to locals and asked for their folk memory maybe?</div><div id="00:47:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, this is something that I wish I&#039;d done more of in the Great Neville&#039;s Historic</div><div id="00:47:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Landscape Study.</div><div id="00:47:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I did talk to Neville Walters.</div><div id="00:47:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, wow.</div><div id="00:47:18.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s brilliant.</div><div id="00:47:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Have you spoken to him?</div><div id="00:47:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got one of my best interviews.</div><div id="00:47:23.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a lady who worked for the Countryside Council for Wales.</div><div id="00:47:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I think her name was Susan Howard, who was my first point of contact at the Countryside</div><div id="00:47:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Council for Wales, just as Rick Turner was my first point of contact in Caddick.</div><div id="00:47:42.000" class="transcript_line"> She introduced me to various sort of local people.</div><div id="00:47:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But Neville was the one who I remember I spent quite a bit of time with.</div><div id="00:47:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I spent about half a day with him.</div><div id="00:47:54.000" class="transcript_line"> He drove me around various places.</div><div id="00:47:57.000" class="transcript_line"> We talked about some of the traditional methods of managing that landscape that he could remember.</div><div id="00:48:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember he told me he was paid something like sixpence for digging a certain length</div><div id="00:48:17.000" class="transcript_line"> of gripe, these spade dug gullies in the surface of the fields.</div><div id="00:48:22.000" class="transcript_line"> It was something like sixpence for 30 feet a day or something like that.</div><div id="00:48:27.000" class="transcript_line"> That is in that book somewhere.</div><div id="00:48:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I did write that down.</div><div id="00:48:32.000" class="transcript_line"> What was really nice was we had a big Living Levels event at the, is it called the Lyset Institute?</div><div id="00:48:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:48:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I was sitting at one of the tables and this elderly gentleman sort of walked past and</div><div id="00:48:50.000" class="transcript_line"> sort of looked at me in that sort of knowing way.</div><div id="00:48:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t recognise him because this was about 23, 25 years ago.</div><div id="00:49:02.000" class="transcript_line"> He obviously recognised me.</div><div id="00:49:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Whether he&#039;d asked somebody, is that Stephen Rippon, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:49:09.000" class="transcript_line"> He obviously recognised me and I recognised that he clearly knew me.</div><div id="00:49:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I guessed it might have been him.</div><div id="00:49:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I went out and we had a nice little chat.</div><div id="00:49:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I wish I&#039;d done more of that.</div><div id="00:49:27.000" class="transcript_line"> The people I did talk to, it was very useful.</div><div id="00:49:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I found out about the cycle of cleaning out the ditches.</div><div id="00:49:40.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s only the major water courses that you would have cleaned out every year.</div><div id="00:49:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Then you&#039;d have this cycle of cleaning the minor reams perhaps every three years.</div><div id="00:49:53.000" class="transcript_line"> The field boundaries, a farmer might just clean out two field boundaries a year.</div><div id="00:50:00.000" class="transcript_line"> They might have something like almost a 30-year cycle, some of them.</div><div id="00:50:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, that&#039;s how you get the difference in vegetation in these ditches because you get these different times.</div><div id="00:50:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Neville told me all about that.</div><div id="00:50:14.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a particular feature that is of particular interest to you?</div><div id="00:50:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve always had a soft spot for Whitsun.</div><div id="00:50:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Right from the start of my work, it was obviously a very odd block of the landscape.</div><div id="00:50:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I went so far in unraveling its history and so on.</div><div id="00:50:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, that is in the book.</div><div id="00:50:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I do speculate in the book that it might have been associated with Flemish immigrants.</div><div id="00:50:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Why? Really? Why?</div><div id="00:50:58.000" class="transcript_line"> We know that Flemings were brought to Pembrokeshire in the 12th century</div><div id="00:51:06.000" class="transcript_line"> As part of the English conquest of Wales, they would use colonists to settle land.</div><div id="00:51:15.000" class="transcript_line"> There were a lot of Flemish mercenaries at that time too, weren&#039;t there?</div><div id="00:51:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. It&#039;s well documented in Pembrokeshire.</div><div id="00:51:24.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s interesting.</div><div id="00:51:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I recognise that the morphology of Whitsun is very similar to villages in the low countries.</div><div id="00:51:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:51:36.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s as far as I got in the Gwent levels historic landscape study.</div><div id="00:51:42.000" class="transcript_line"> How interesting.</div><div id="00:51:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I gave a lecture at the University of Ghent probably about six years ago now.</div><div id="00:51:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:51:53.000" class="transcript_line"> One of their brighter master students came up to me afterwards and said he was interested in...</div><div id="00:52:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a slide about Whitsun and wondered if it was Flemish.</div><div id="00:52:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:52:08.000" class="transcript_line"> This student, Gerven, went on to do it as his PhD.</div><div id="00:52:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow, really?</div><div id="00:52:15.000" class="transcript_line"> He has found morphological similarities.</div><div id="00:52:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:52:21.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a local historian that Mark Lewis knows about who has found some links in the documents with a Flemish family who held Whitsun.</div><div id="00:52:35.000" class="transcript_line"> How curious.</div><div id="00:52:37.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s one of the exciting things about being an academic.</div><div id="00:52:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:52:42.000" class="transcript_line"> You do have to brace yourself for the fact that sometimes what you say is proved right, sometimes it&#039;s proved wrong.</div><div id="00:52:50.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s so nice when it&#039;s proved right though, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:52:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:52:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think those early speculations probably have been proved right through Gerven&#039;s PhD and also the research of this historian.</div><div id="00:53:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I was thinking, Steve, I won&#039;t take much longer, looking at the Wendt Lug levels, which has been massively developed, how do you do your work there?</div><div id="00:53:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Are you able to do anything there?</div><div id="00:53:23.000" class="transcript_line"> The interest in the Wendt Lug level, and this goes back to John Allen again, he found a lot of Roman material.</div><div id="00:53:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Off of what&#039;s called Rumney Great Wharf.</div><div id="00:53:38.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a cardiff end.</div><div id="00:53:40.000" class="transcript_line"> The Wendt Lug level has got this very strange landscape of lots of long, narrow fields, blocks sort of next to each other.</div><div id="00:53:51.000" class="transcript_line"> It looks like it could be Roman in date.</div><div id="00:53:57.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just gradually getting covered in development.</div><div id="00:54:02.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a great loss.</div><div id="00:54:04.000" class="transcript_line"> One of the things that I have learned is that you do, however, have to pull back.</div><div id="00:54:11.000" class="transcript_line"> If you got terribly upset by every development in every landscape that you&#039;d ever studied, you&#039;d just be a manic depressive.</div><div id="00:54:20.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re right.</div><div id="00:54:23.000" class="transcript_line"> You have to detach yourself, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:54:26.000" class="transcript_line"> You do, but when I go back to the Wendt levels, I do get a great pang of affection.</div><div id="00:54:33.000" class="transcript_line"> But it is very sad to see that some areas, some bits of it are getting developed.</div><div id="00:54:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I think if there had been a positive from the M4 diversion, it might have drawn a line on the map that the planners could have said, no more.</div><div id="00:54:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not developing south of that line.</div><div id="00:55:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I had this discussion with various people about the pros and cons of that motorway.</div><div id="00:55:07.000" class="transcript_line"> It would have taken some land from the levels.</div><div id="00:55:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I just wondered whether it might have drawn a line and no development would have been permitted south of it.</div><div id="00:55:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:55:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Because the problem with the Wendt Lughe level really is it&#039;s the development spilling in from the Cardiff area.</div><div id="00:55:26.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s just nothing to stop it.</div><div id="00:55:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I fear for Wendt Lughe.</div><div id="00:55:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it will go the way of the Avon levels near Bristol, which they&#039;re just getting covered in development as well.</div><div id="00:55:45.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s not very little space there now, is there?</div><div id="00:55:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, there doesn&#039;t seem to be much space there anyway.</div><div id="00:55:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Can I just ask you quickly about the drainage?</div><div id="00:55:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So you would be looking at that evidence of that as well in your landscape?</div><div id="00:55:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:55:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So to me, it seemed terribly complicated.</div><div id="00:56:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So how have you managed to work that out?</div><div id="00:56:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Is that by referring to the drainage maps?</div><div id="00:56:09.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot of it was actually quite obvious just by walking around the landscape talking to Susan Howard all those years ago.</div><div id="00:56:18.000" class="transcript_line"> The way that the drainage system works hasn&#039;t fundamentally changed for a thousand years.</div><div id="00:56:27.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s gravity led.</div><div id="00:56:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:56:32.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s not the pumping that you get, for example, on the Somerset levels and have had on the Somerset levels for many hundreds of years.</div><div id="00:56:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s just a gravity fed system where you know the Monks did.</div><div id="00:56:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:56:48.000" class="transcript_line"> You see that?</div><div id="00:56:49.000" class="transcript_line"> That is one of the channels that is designed to take streams flowing off of the uplands across the levels without flooding them.</div><div id="00:56:58.000" class="transcript_line"> That deals with that problem.</div><div id="00:57:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:57:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Then you&#039;ve got to deal with all the wet stuff falling out of the sky, the rain.</div><div id="00:57:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:57:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s why you have the gripes.</div><div id="00:57:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:57:08.000" class="transcript_line"> They take their water into the field boundary ditches, the field boundary ditches drain into the reams.</div><div id="00:57:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:57:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And reams then discharge their waters under the seawall through those tidal sluices.</div><div id="00:57:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s a very simple system.</div><div id="00:57:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:57:23.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s wonderfully simple.</div><div id="00:57:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s sophisticated because the land is lower away from the seawall, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:57:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s effectively going up, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:57:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, no, you just have to dig the ditches deeper and deeper as you go towards the coast.</div><div id="00:57:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:57:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:57:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:57:44.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the thing.</div><div id="00:57:46.000" class="transcript_line"> See, the other feature, which means that it works, is because of the huge tidal range of the seven estuary.</div><div id="00:57:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:57:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So what basically happens is that when the tide is high, the flap on those tidal gates is foreshut.</div><div id="00:58:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So all the water is held in the drainage ditches in the levels.</div><div id="00:58:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But then you get this long period when the tide goes down, the tidal gates can open and you then get this very long period when all the water can flow out.</div><div id="00:58:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:58:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So if you had a much smaller tidal range, those tidal flaps could end up being closed for much longer.</div><div id="00:58:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:58:35.000" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="00:58:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:58:37.000" class="transcript_line"> They were actually really closed for a relatively short period of the day.</div><div id="00:58:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:58:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s also why this gravity fed system can work, because enough of the water can get out.</div><div id="00:58:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:58:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Quite quickly.</div><div id="00:58:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you know the movements of the seven, you know, it&#039;s ebbing and flowing and all that.</div><div id="00:59:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Is that something that&#039;s of interest to landscape archaeologists like you?</div><div id="00:59:04.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a natural phenomenon.</div><div id="00:59:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:59:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, it&#039;s instrumental to the wetlands having been created.</div><div id="00:59:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But you do get wetland landscapes like that, for example, around the Thames Estuary that has a much, much smaller tidal range.</div><div id="00:59:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:59:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Much, much smaller.</div><div id="00:59:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:59:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s interesting.</div><div id="00:59:26.000" class="transcript_line"> But.</div><div id="00:59:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Just in the background, really.</div><div id="00:59:30.000" class="transcript_line"> In the background.</div><div id="00:59:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:59:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:59:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Steve, I&#039;ve kept you far too long.</div><div id="00:59:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m really sorry.</div><div id="00:59:36.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been so interesting.</div><div id="00:59:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to type this up and I&#039;ll send it to you so you can look through and cross things out or correct me.</div><div id="00:59:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And if I wanted to ask any extra questions, I&#039;ll put it on that if that&#039;s OK with you.</div><div id="00:59:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s fine.</div><div id="00:59:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Is that all right?</div><div id="00:59:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:59:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I&#039;m sure there&#039;s something I&#039;ve forgotten to ask.</div><div id="00:59:55.000" class="transcript_line"> A glaring gap.</div><div id="00:59:56.000" class="transcript_line"> But thank you so much.</div><div id="00:59:58.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s so interesting.</div><div id="00:59:59.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s great.</div><div id="01:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:00:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:00:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Okey dokey.</div><div id="01:00:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you so much.</div><div id="01:00:04.000" class="transcript_line"> You take care.</div><div id="01:00:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Nice to chat to you.</div><div id="01:00:06.000" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="01:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Bye bye.</div><div id="01:00:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Thanks Steve.</div><div id="01:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Bye bye.</div><div id="01:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Bye.</div><div id="01:00:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Bye.</div></div></p>
