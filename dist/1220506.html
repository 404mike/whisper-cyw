I should perhaps tell you that my mother had the misfortune</div><div id="00:00:08.600" class="transcript_line"> of losing three daughters. We&#039;re back to threes. The eldest one was born in 1916, probably</div><div id="00:00:17.200" class="transcript_line"> died of Spanish flu in 1919. The second one died of what we now call sepsis or septicemia</div><div id="00:00:27.040" class="transcript_line"> at the age of two. And the third one, tragically, my mother accidentally smothered in bed. And</div><div id="00:00:37.360" class="transcript_line"> she was convinced that she was possessed of a dybbuk. And old Jerovich, who was very wise,</div><div id="00:00:47.400" class="transcript_line"> who taught me my Bible, wonderful man, he did something quite remarkable because Jews</div><div id="00:00:53.120" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t believe in devils. They don&#039;t believe in exorcism. But he did. He said,</div><div id="00:00:59.680" class="transcript_line"> you are possessed by a dybbuk, I will remove it. And he did. I wasn&#039;t party to this. I&#039;ve</div><div id="00:01:08.080" class="transcript_line"> only been told by Saul. And that in fact there was a whole olly-wolly-bolly and it&#039;s gone,</div><div id="00:01:15.040" class="transcript_line"> suddenly. And she was fine. And then she had three children who all lived reasonable lives.</div><div id="00:01:24.600" class="transcript_line"> Three sons.</div></div></p>
