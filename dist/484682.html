    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, date of interview is 14th of October 2014 and the interviewer is Catherine McShane.</div><div id="00:00:18.640" class="transcript_line"> The name of the interviewee is Tathan McShane and the interview is collecting stories for</div><div id="00:00:24.960" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project and the interview is in Penilan in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:00:31.760" class="transcript_line"> Could you spell your name just for the tape? T-A-T-H-A-N-M-C-S-H-A-N-E. Lovely. So what was</div><div id="00:00:44.440" class="transcript_line"> your involvement in Cardiff Carnival? Well I&#039;ve been involved with a few carnivals over the years,</div><div id="00:00:49.880" class="transcript_line"> starting from when I was quite young, lots of dressing up, things like that. I think most of</div><div id="00:00:56.080" class="transcript_line"> the costumes were made by my mum during that period. I think most of my time spent in the</div><div id="00:01:01.080" class="transcript_line"> workshops etc. was probably running around with the other kids trying to make cause as much trouble</div><div id="00:01:06.280" class="transcript_line"> as possible and then there was a lot of dancing, lots of music and everything. I remember that from</div><div id="00:01:12.120" class="transcript_line"> the early days. My most vivid memories probably with the steel pans, you know,</div><div id="00:01:19.520" class="transcript_line"> when I was a little bit older, my teenage years, did a couple of years in the steel pans, some of</div><div id="00:01:23.960" class="transcript_line"> them in the pit sing rain which was a lot of fun emptying out the steel pans during halfway through</div><div id="00:01:28.600" class="transcript_line"> or more than once definitely. But that was very enjoyable as well, had a lot of fun doing that,</div><div id="00:01:35.040" class="transcript_line"> very into music at the time and it was a nice environment where anyone, you didn&#039;t really have</div><div id="00:01:41.160" class="transcript_line"> to be from a musical background but everyone got involved no matter what level or experience you</div><div id="00:01:45.520" class="transcript_line"> had. It was a very welcoming environment, especially for a musical one. There&#039;s always</div><div id="00:01:54.960" class="transcript_line"> the big costumes that you remember, all the colours and as the years have gone by, the bigger</div><div id="00:02:02.280" class="transcript_line"> the crowd, for me I remember the crowds always being bigger as the years went on. I don&#039;t remember</div><div id="00:02:07.920" class="transcript_line"> them so much when I was younger possibly because I was young but I felt like there&#039;s always a bigger</div><div id="00:02:12.520" class="transcript_line"> following, especially when it moved to the bay and there was a big deal down in the bay,</div><div id="00:02:15.840" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s always a lot of people down there. So yeah, no, they were some of the lasting memories</div><div id="00:02:22.120" class="transcript_line"> in mind from the carnivals. Any particular themes or costumes you particularly remember? One of the</div><div id="00:02:29.520" class="transcript_line"> costumes I remember most of all was probably the dark riders. I think it was about the age,</div><div id="00:02:35.400" class="transcript_line"> it was probably about 13, 14 and that was always quite a cool one for me, I thought,</div><div id="00:02:40.680" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s exciting. But equally, I remember my brother and I dressed up in green and white and my brother</div><div id="00:02:47.440" class="transcript_line"> was a sheep and I was a dragon and that was always good for me because he was a sheep and I was a</div><div id="00:02:52.440" class="transcript_line"> dragon so I win basically. So that was a lot of fun. Yeah, they were some of the costumes I</div><div id="00:02:59.880" class="transcript_line"> remember mostly. I don&#039;t know about any of the other costumes that much, I remember dressing up</div><div id="00:03:06.120" class="transcript_line"> as a monkey when I was young but nothing massively from my themes personally that stick out. Okay,</div><div id="00:03:14.080" class="transcript_line"> any memories about other people who were involved or people you met along the way?</div><div id="00:03:18.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I mean what was nice is there was always sort of a consistency, there was always sort of</div><div id="00:03:26.520" class="transcript_line"> the same crowd around, you got to know people every year. There were new people every year but</div><div id="00:03:30.920" class="transcript_line"> there was a couple of stalwarts that you saw no matter what year, they were always there every day</div><div id="00:03:36.040" class="transcript_line"> in the workshop putting countless hours in to making sure it happened and that everyone had</div><div id="00:03:40.840" class="transcript_line"> their costumes and everything how they wanted to be. Also the same about the people that were</div><div id="00:03:47.760" class="transcript_line"> leading the practices, there was a lot of people that were there every year, whether it was dancing,</div><div id="00:03:54.240" class="transcript_line"> whether it was steel pans or anything else.</div><div id="00:04:03.840" class="transcript_line"> And in terms of the weather, you talked about the weather, how many times do you think you did it in the rain?</div><div id="00:04:10.480" class="transcript_line"> Did I do it in the dry? I mean I think that&#039;s probably the question, maybe twice I didn&#039;t. I</div><div id="00:04:18.960" class="transcript_line"> think there was a lot of, I think I had a lot of rainy experiences, maybe when I was a bit younger</div><div id="00:04:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I do remember too where they were dry. I think the majority were quite wet, some of them</div><div id="00:04:29.880" class="transcript_line"> wetter than others, I&#039;ll probably go with on the whole. So overall how would you rate your experience</div><div id="00:04:36.360" class="transcript_line"> of being involved in Cardiff Carnival? Oh I loved every minute of it, you know when I was younger</div><div id="00:04:42.400" class="transcript_line"> there was always experiences with lots of other children from all different backgrounds, everyone</div><div id="00:04:46.000" class="transcript_line"> got together, it was a very nice way to socialise, it was always a good atmosphere, always a good vibe</div><div id="00:04:53.040" class="transcript_line"> there. And then even on the day it was always building up and the excitement was always building</div><div id="00:05:03.760" class="transcript_line"> up and you&#039;d go to the workshop more often and you&#039;d see people were in there from morning till</div><div id="00:05:10.560" class="transcript_line"> night and it was worked up as almost like a mini Christmas in the summer when it was like this is</div><div id="00:05:15.280" class="transcript_line"> the day and then you&#039;d have the build up in the morning, everyone would be a bit nervous, is it</div><div id="00:05:20.560" class="transcript_line"> going to rain, isn&#039;t it going to rain, or is it already raining? But no matter what everyone was</div><div id="00:05:25.840" class="transcript_line"> always having a good time, it was always a good laugh, always fun, I&#039;ve never had any bad</div><div id="00:05:30.920" class="transcript_line"> experiences with it, it was always a positive. So how did your involvement end? I went to university.</div><div id="00:05:41.120" class="transcript_line"> Fair enough.</div><div id="00:05:44.640" class="transcript_line"> Maybe, I don&#039;t know, yeah probably that.</div><div id="00:05:49.360" class="transcript_line"> Okay thank you very much. Thank you.</div></div></p>
