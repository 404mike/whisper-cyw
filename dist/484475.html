Interviewer Steve Fletcher.</div><div id="00:00:07.800" class="transcript_line"> The venue is the Swicker office.</div><div id="00:00:09.840" class="transcript_line"> Today&#039;s date is Friday the 16th of January 2015.</div><div id="00:00:14.360" class="transcript_line"> Our interviewee is Adrian Wiggins.</div><div id="00:00:17.280" class="transcript_line"> Adrian, for the record, would you please spell your name in four?</div><div id="00:00:21.160" class="transcript_line"> A-D-R-I-A-N</div><div id="00:00:25.480" class="transcript_line"> W-I-W-G-I-N-S</div><div id="00:00:29.200" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much indeed.</div><div id="00:00:31.520" class="transcript_line"> Adrian, what&#039;s your earliest Cardiff Carnival memory?</div><div id="00:00:35.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a tricky one that really.</div><div id="00:00:38.400" class="transcript_line"> I think my earliest one would be</div><div id="00:00:43.840" class="transcript_line"> when I first started drumming with Sam McGillis</div><div id="00:00:47.760" class="transcript_line"> and there was a guy that came in called Sam Alexander</div><div id="00:00:52.240" class="transcript_line"> who&#039;s a very good friend of mine still to this day.</div><div id="00:00:55.120" class="transcript_line"> And I learnt the art of Maraca 2.</div><div id="00:01:02.320" class="transcript_line"> And one of my earliest memories was</div><div id="00:01:06.760" class="transcript_line"> learning Maraca 2 in this room and somebody coming in going,</div><div id="00:01:10.480" class="transcript_line"> knocking on the door, coming in saying,</div><div id="00:01:13.400" class="transcript_line"> this is Maraca 2, could you tell me where Maraca 1 is?</div><div id="00:01:16.120" class="transcript_line"> That was good.</div><div id="00:01:18.920" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m just...</div><div id="00:01:21.480" class="transcript_line"> This day is still a good joke.</div><div id="00:01:24.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and then...</div><div id="00:01:30.040" class="transcript_line"> I think I had my first blister from drumming Maraca 2</div><div id="00:01:34.240" class="transcript_line"> and parading onto the Hayes,</div><div id="00:01:37.240" class="transcript_line"> which is now St David&#039;s too, unfortunately.</div><div id="00:01:39.640" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s just been gross by the whole Carnival thing and drumming.</div><div id="00:01:48.560" class="transcript_line"> My first memory of drumming was actually at Channel View.</div><div id="00:01:56.520" class="transcript_line"> Walking along with my kids and hearing this drumming</div><div id="00:02:01.520" class="transcript_line"> and it dragging me into the room</div><div id="00:02:04.640" class="transcript_line"> and I didn&#039;t realise at the time, but looking back,</div><div id="00:02:08.840" class="transcript_line"> that was a door into a new world for me.</div><div id="00:02:11.280" class="transcript_line"> And seeing this drumming and thinking, I want to do this.</div><div id="00:02:15.160" class="transcript_line"> And I think you were there, actually.</div><div id="00:02:18.080" class="transcript_line"> Very probably.</div><div id="00:02:19.320" class="transcript_line"> Maybe going, come on in, come on in.</div><div id="00:02:21.160" class="transcript_line"> And then that was that.</div><div id="00:02:22.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s true to say that in terms of the community percussion and the samba,</div><div id="00:02:26.680" class="transcript_line"> I think that both your daughters followed in your footsteps.</div><div id="00:02:31.000" class="transcript_line"> All of them.</div><div id="00:02:32.480" class="transcript_line"> All my three girls, yeah, they&#039;ve all gone.</div><div id="00:02:35.360" class="transcript_line"> In fact, I could put a group together with them quite easily.</div><div id="00:02:40.400" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve used them as ringers in the past for different things.</div><div id="00:02:44.360" class="transcript_line"> I heard of Von Trapp singers, but the Von Trapp drummers is a new one on me.</div><div id="00:02:48.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that would be a good one.</div><div id="00:02:51.360" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, lots of memories of Carnival.</div><div id="00:02:54.440" class="transcript_line"> And when you contacted me to come in and do this,</div><div id="00:03:00.080" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been thinking about various things.</div><div id="00:03:03.760" class="transcript_line"> And in our conversation before, I&#039;m just remembering when it started</div><div id="00:03:08.680" class="transcript_line"> and when it finished.</div><div id="00:03:11.560" class="transcript_line"> And I think the first...</div><div id="00:03:15.040" class="transcript_line"> So when I first started playing was under the tutelage of Sam</div><div id="00:03:19.680" class="transcript_line"> and Chris and Simon, with Samba Glez.</div><div id="00:03:25.400" class="transcript_line"> And then I think my first year as a leader would have been around</div><div id="00:03:30.400" class="transcript_line"> about probably about 92 or 93.</div><div id="00:03:33.920" class="transcript_line"> And I fell in, fell into teaching, really.</div><div id="00:03:40.480" class="transcript_line"> Actually, funnily enough,</div><div id="00:03:43.400" class="transcript_line"> a memory just came to my head, was at Katae&#039;s Community Centre.</div><div id="00:03:49.040" class="transcript_line"> So I just got so engrossed in the drumming</div><div id="00:03:55.000" class="transcript_line"> and just found that I could pick it up and run with it.</div><div id="00:03:59.320" class="transcript_line"> And I think there was one particular day</div><div id="00:04:04.080" class="transcript_line"> Chris or Sam wasn&#039;t there.</div><div id="00:04:07.240" class="transcript_line"> And somebody came into the room and said,</div><div id="00:04:09.920" class="transcript_line"> Oh, how does that rhythm go?</div><div id="00:04:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And I went, Oh, it goes like this.</div><div id="00:04:15.440" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t really know how to teach.</div><div id="00:04:18.160" class="transcript_line"> And somebody said, Well, you&#039;re teaching now.</div><div id="00:04:21.200" class="transcript_line"> And that was the first time I&#039;d ever taught anybody, you know,</div><div id="00:04:25.360" class="transcript_line"> because I just did it. It was just me.</div><div id="00:04:27.160" class="transcript_line"> That was the first time I passed on my knowledge to somebody else</div><div id="00:04:31.240" class="transcript_line"> and without realising, you know.</div><div id="00:04:34.160" class="transcript_line"> And from then on, I just became a teacher of drumming.</div><div id="00:04:40.680" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:04:41.680" class="transcript_line"> Obviously, costumes are a huge part of Carnival as well.</div><div id="00:04:44.280" class="transcript_line"> And you used to get involved in the making of costumes.</div><div id="00:04:48.720" class="transcript_line"> Do any come to mind when you think of, well, on the one hand,</div><div id="00:04:52.120" class="transcript_line"> costumes that you and your percussion band have worn on parade</div><div id="00:04:55.600" class="transcript_line"> or others that stick in your mind from past Carnival?</div><div id="00:04:59.640" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a few, actually.</div><div id="00:05:00.760" class="transcript_line"> I think the most famous one, the ones that looked great</div><div id="00:05:06.480" class="transcript_line"> were the skeleton outfits or the skellies, as we call them.</div><div id="00:05:10.160" class="transcript_line"> Took us weeks to make them.</div><div id="00:05:14.280" class="transcript_line"> And Sally and myself were just there constantly printing them out.</div><div id="00:05:19.600" class="transcript_line"> And I think we printed front and back about 20 skeleton outfits,</div><div id="00:05:25.480" class="transcript_line"> which we then kept hold of and used them for our own performances.</div><div id="00:05:30.440" class="transcript_line"> I think that was our first proper</div><div id="00:05:36.280" class="transcript_line"> Carnival performance as repercussion street band.</div><div id="00:05:40.640" class="transcript_line"> And yes, so that and we think we also had</div><div id="00:05:46.760" class="transcript_line"> headpieces as well, which are really uncomfortable to wear.</div><div id="00:05:51.320" class="transcript_line"> So those are great because they were Lycra leggings</div><div id="00:05:56.200" class="transcript_line"> and they glow or fluorescent scully out for printing.</div><div id="00:06:02.840" class="transcript_line"> And I think then there was one year where we had to do these barcodes,</div><div id="00:06:08.680" class="transcript_line"> which were the most fiddliest bloody thing.</div><div id="00:06:11.520" class="transcript_line"> I had to sew bits of plastic onto</div><div id="00:06:16.160" class="transcript_line"> the same sort of leggings and T-shirts with these really intricate.</div><div id="00:06:20.640" class="transcript_line"> It took ages to put these things together.</div><div id="00:06:25.080" class="transcript_line"> And really fiddly.</div><div id="00:06:28.040" class="transcript_line"> We got them all together and we got out onto the street</div><div id="00:06:30.440" class="transcript_line"> and it was pissing down the rain, excuse the language.</div><div id="00:06:33.320" class="transcript_line"> And within about five minutes, it fell apart.</div><div id="00:06:38.640" class="transcript_line"> A classic carnival tradition.</div><div id="00:06:40.520" class="transcript_line"> Disintegrating costumes.</div><div id="00:06:43.520" class="transcript_line"> And we were just I think you were you were actually trying to hold off the carnival.</div><div id="00:06:48.240" class="transcript_line"> We were trying to find a window of opportunity to get onto the street.</div><div id="00:06:51.320" class="transcript_line"> It was like, right, let&#039;s just go for it.</div><div id="00:06:53.320" class="transcript_line"> And we got onto the street.</div><div id="00:06:54.480" class="transcript_line"> And that was one of my earliest memories of drumming in the rain</div><div id="00:06:58.640" class="transcript_line"> and helped by an ample amount of rum.</div><div id="00:07:07.760" class="transcript_line"> And just embracing the weather, you know, and just.</div><div id="00:07:11.840" class="transcript_line"> Do you find when it&#039;s raining?</div><div id="00:07:13.080" class="transcript_line"> I can remember the first time it ever rained on a carnival.</div><div id="00:07:16.520" class="transcript_line"> I think it was 1991 that we were passing the haze</div><div id="00:07:19.480" class="transcript_line"> and Sam was leaving the band at the time.</div><div id="00:07:22.160" class="transcript_line"> And he looked at me and fair play to him.</div><div id="00:07:25.760" class="transcript_line"> He just started shouting and screaming.</div><div id="00:07:28.520" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember him poguing, jumping up and down like a mad thing.</div><div id="00:07:32.240" class="transcript_line"> And of course, the band responded to this.</div><div id="00:07:34.640" class="transcript_line"> Because the band pushed it up.</div><div id="00:07:36.320" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s all like, you know, nothing&#039;s going to stop us.</div><div id="00:07:38.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, all the masqueraders, the revelers and the audience stayed with it.</div><div id="00:07:43.160" class="transcript_line"> And I remember thinking, God bless you, Sam.</div><div id="00:07:46.080" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ve shown us what our response to rain is,</div><div id="00:07:49.040" class="transcript_line"> which is to go to take it to the sixth gear, to really go completely.</div><div id="00:07:54.600" class="transcript_line"> You know, this is the.</div><div id="00:07:55.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, definitely. I&#039;ve played.</div><div id="00:07:57.760" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve done many a parade in the rain</div><div id="00:08:01.080" class="transcript_line"> and performed abroad in France with my band.</div><div id="00:08:04.480" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s rained and instead of getting down by it,</div><div id="00:08:09.280" class="transcript_line"> you just you up it and go above and beyond and just embrace it and shout</div><div id="00:08:14.160" class="transcript_line"> and give off, you give off the energy, your band responds to it.</div><div id="00:08:18.640" class="transcript_line"> The crowd responds to it.</div><div id="00:08:20.080" class="transcript_line"> The band responds to that and you just spiral up.</div><div id="00:08:22.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:24.240" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t stand that. Yeah, yeah, definitely.</div><div id="00:08:26.440" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, I mean, I prefer not to play in the rain.</div><div id="00:08:31.480" class="transcript_line"> This is Wales. This is Wales.</div><div id="00:08:33.400" class="transcript_line"> It does happen. Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:34.800" class="transcript_line"> Obviously, percussion&#039;s played the last part of your life.</div><div id="00:08:37.720" class="transcript_line"> You know, what do you do now?</div><div id="00:08:39.960" class="transcript_line"> How have you sort of gone from that very first?</div><div id="00:08:42.760" class="transcript_line"> I love seeing the idea of your hearing.</div><div id="00:08:46.120" class="transcript_line"> Samba, perhaps live for the first time,</div><div id="00:08:48.160" class="transcript_line"> percussion live for the first time, becoming into Channel View.</div><div id="00:08:51.160" class="transcript_line"> And that just, you know, it was like it was like an entity</div><div id="00:08:55.080" class="transcript_line"> dragging me into that room and change my life.</div><div id="00:08:57.840" class="transcript_line"> The force was strong.</div><div id="00:08:58.880" class="transcript_line"> It was and changed my life forever.</div><div id="00:09:01.080" class="transcript_line"> I would not be doing what I&#039;m doing now if it wasn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:09:06.080" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think it was a chance encounter.</div><div id="00:09:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I would have gotten to what I&#039;m doing now. Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:12.680" class="transcript_line"> But I do think that I think about it quite a lot.</div><div id="00:09:15.360" class="transcript_line"> How? At what point I would have got into it,</div><div id="00:09:19.120" class="transcript_line"> because I&#039;m actually member seeing some of the layers playing in the haze.</div><div id="00:09:24.280" class="transcript_line"> Probably a few months before that, and I hadn&#039;t long moved to Cardiff.</div><div id="00:09:27.960" class="transcript_line"> And just am ambling around, you know, not really having a direction.</div><div id="00:09:33.440" class="transcript_line"> I mean, what I was doing, nothing really.</div><div id="00:09:35.080" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d moved from Brecon to Cardiff and didn&#039;t really know many people.</div><div id="00:09:38.800" class="transcript_line"> And I remember seeing a bunch of hippies, degenerates,</div><div id="00:09:44.400" class="transcript_line"> or whatever they looked like, you know,</div><div id="00:09:47.600" class="transcript_line"> hitting bits of whatever they were.</div><div id="00:09:49.360" class="transcript_line"> I had no clue what they were doing.</div><div id="00:09:51.320" class="transcript_line"> You know, it&#039;s just been enthralled and intrigued by</div><div id="00:09:55.200" class="transcript_line"> by and how it all came together.</div><div id="00:09:57.360" class="transcript_line"> And and then that was that.</div><div id="00:09:59.160" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, OK, whatever, as you do.</div><div id="00:10:02.160" class="transcript_line"> And then and then this one particular day,</div><div id="00:10:04.680" class="transcript_line"> but in Channel View and hearing this drumming and</div><div id="00:10:08.600" class="transcript_line"> and like the entity bringing me in and opening this door to this world,</div><div id="00:10:13.160" class="transcript_line"> which I I&#039;m I am now.</div><div id="00:10:17.120" class="transcript_line"> And that was probably.</div><div id="00:10:19.480" class="transcript_line"> Well, that&#039;s got to be about 24 years ago then.</div><div id="00:10:24.720" class="transcript_line"> Or more. That&#039;s crazy.</div><div id="00:10:28.960" class="transcript_line"> And now I.</div><div id="00:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, I teach Samba as a team building</div><div id="00:10:36.560" class="transcript_line"> session, you know, all over Europe and the world.</div><div id="00:10:40.040" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m a professional musician.</div><div id="00:10:44.840" class="transcript_line"> I like to think that quite good at what I do.</div><div id="00:10:49.160" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m forever, forever grateful for for that opportunity.</div><div id="00:10:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think on that note, Adrian Williams, thank you very much.</div><div id="00:10:58.400" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re welcome. For the interview.</div><div id="00:10:59.960" class="transcript_line"> And what? It&#039;s just been great fun. Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Which is great.
