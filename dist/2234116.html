    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> November 1944, Herman Rothman, a German Jewish refugee, has joined the British army and crossed</div><div id="00:00:12.920" class="transcript_line"> the English Channel into Nazi-occupied Europe.</div><div id="00:00:16.920" class="transcript_line"> He arrives at Ostend in Belgium.</div><div id="00:00:19.720" class="transcript_line"> Almost immediately, we were dive-bombed.</div><div id="00:00:23.480" class="transcript_line"> I heard planes coming over, German planes, and starting to dive-bomb the railway station</div><div id="00:00:30.640" class="transcript_line"> or somewhere.</div><div id="00:00:32.080" class="transcript_line"> The shock of it was so immense, I can&#039;t tell you.</div><div id="00:00:37.600" class="transcript_line"> And I said, well, that&#039;s war.</div><div id="00:00:39.400" class="transcript_line"> That is war.</div><div id="00:00:40.400" class="transcript_line"> What I&#039;ve experienced there was theatre compared with, that is war.</div><div id="00:00:46.480" class="transcript_line"> April 1945.</div><div id="00:00:49.200" class="transcript_line"> The Western Allied forces have entered Germany.</div><div id="00:00:53.360" class="transcript_line"> Welshman William Richard Williams, at the time a captain in the 8th British Army Corps,</div><div id="00:00:59.040" class="transcript_line"> is tasked with investigating reports of a camp run by the Nazi SS near the town of Bergen.</div><div id="00:01:07.640" class="transcript_line"> The first indication we had of things not going quite right was when we got up the River</div><div id="00:01:17.240" class="transcript_line"> Aller.</div><div id="00:01:18.240" class="transcript_line"> This is where we come to Belsen.</div><div id="00:01:22.220" class="transcript_line"> We went through the gate into the camp proper, and it was something which a sight that I</div><div id="00:01:28.020" class="transcript_line"> will never forget.</div><div id="00:01:29.700" class="transcript_line"> It was just a series of barbed wire, high barbed wire fences.</div><div id="00:01:34.340" class="transcript_line"> There were bundles that looked like rags but turned out to be dead inmates.</div><div id="00:01:40.020" class="transcript_line"> There were inmates hanging on the wires, fallen beside it, grotesque positions, and you just</div><div id="00:01:50.840" class="transcript_line"> had to pick your way through them.</div><div id="00:01:52.640" class="transcript_line"> Two were walking and came towards us, and the SS, my escort, just shot them.</div><div id="00:02:04.980" class="transcript_line"> As restrictions on enemy aliens were gradually lifted, many German and Austrian refugees</div><div id="00:02:10.400" class="transcript_line"> decided to fight back at the Nazis by enlisting in the British armed forces.</div><div id="00:02:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Once the Allies began to liberate German-held territory in 1944 and 1945, the horrific fate</div><div id="00:02:23.960" class="transcript_line"> of those Jews left behind became clear.</div><div id="00:02:29.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Maurice Brodie, historian at Aberystwyth University.</div><div id="00:02:33.920" class="transcript_line"> In this final episode of the Holocaust in Wales, we look at tales of liberation and</div><div id="00:02:39.480" class="transcript_line"> of loss.</div><div id="00:02:41.480" class="transcript_line"> We hear how Jewish refugees came to Wales to train as they prepared to liberate continental</div><div id="00:02:46.420" class="transcript_line"> Europe.</div><div id="00:02:48.460" class="transcript_line"> We listen to Welsh servicemen who witnessed the horrors of the concentration camps.</div><div id="00:02:54.140" class="transcript_line"> And we learn about survivors who managed to live through one of the darkest periods in</div><div id="00:02:58.500" class="transcript_line"> human history and ultimately find a home in Wales.</div><div id="00:03:03.980" class="transcript_line"> Initially, enemy aliens were barred from serving in the regular British armed forces.</div><div id="00:03:11.620" class="transcript_line"> They were only allowed to join an auxiliary unit known as the Pioneer Corps.</div><div id="00:03:17.660" class="transcript_line"> The Pioneer Corps performed non-combatant tasks like trench-sticking, bridge-building</div><div id="00:03:22.740" class="transcript_line"> and clearing roads.</div><div id="00:03:25.180" class="transcript_line"> Herbert Anderson was an Austrian Jew who came to Britain in February 1939.</div><div id="00:03:31.500" class="transcript_line"> He was classified as a friendly alien at the outbreak of war, which meant he avoided internment.</div><div id="00:03:38.580" class="transcript_line"> He joined the Pioneer Corps in early 1940 and was initially stationed in Kent.</div><div id="00:03:44.660" class="transcript_line"> By the end of that week, we must have been about 200 friendly aliens.</div><div id="00:03:52.900" class="transcript_line"> I would think the percentage was as follows.</div><div id="00:03:56.180" class="transcript_line"> Germany 60%, Austria 25%, other nationals 15%.</div><div id="00:04:05.300" class="transcript_line"> Denomination-wise it must have been Jewish 70%, non-Jewish 30%.</div><div id="00:04:13.580" class="transcript_line"> This little refugee army, which grew to a total figure of, I think, 5,000 in the course</div><div id="00:04:23.140" class="transcript_line"> of that year, 1940.</div><div id="00:04:26.740" class="transcript_line"> Because it was a non-combatant unit, some aliens were unhappy at being restricted to</div><div id="00:04:32.060" class="transcript_line"> the Pioneer Corps.</div><div id="00:04:34.060" class="transcript_line"> George Lane, originally from Hungary, had been accepted to join the Grenadiers, but</div><div id="00:04:39.780" class="transcript_line"> the Home Office found out and ordered his deportation as a friendly alien, since Hungary</div><div id="00:04:45.220" class="transcript_line"> was not then involved in the war.</div><div id="00:04:48.220" class="transcript_line"> This order was rescinded, but…</div><div id="00:04:51.260" class="transcript_line"> I was not allowed to join the Grenadiers, I was only allowed to join the Alien Pioneer</div><div id="00:04:56.900" class="transcript_line"> Corps, which made me so angry that I nearly exploded with fury.</div><div id="00:05:03.500" class="transcript_line"> And for nearly a year I was using a pick and a shovel, doing navy work for the army.</div><div id="00:05:11.940" class="transcript_line"> I quickly became a sergeant and had the most extraordinary section of mostly German Jews,</div><div id="00:05:19.420" class="transcript_line"> who were very highly educated people, and there we were, you know, using a pick and</div><div id="00:05:24.540" class="transcript_line"> a shovel.</div><div id="00:05:26.300" class="transcript_line"> Herbert Andersen&#039;s unit, the 87th Pioneer Corps, was soon transferred to Pembrokeshire.</div><div id="00:05:33.180" class="transcript_line"> There was a little village called Angle nearby, where we went to the local pub in the evening,</div><div id="00:05:40.060" class="transcript_line"> but that wasn&#039;t the purpose of our being there.</div><div id="00:05:42.900" class="transcript_line"> We had to help the Royal Artillery at Manor Beer.</div><div id="00:05:47.260" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s quite a well-known name in the history of the RAF, because it is used as a place</div><div id="00:05:55.060" class="transcript_line"> where there is target shooting.</div><div id="00:05:57.860" class="transcript_line"> An RAF plane would drag a target behind and the artillery would have to shoot it down.</div><div id="00:06:06.420" class="transcript_line"> And what we had to do was to help the artillery, carrying ammunition.</div><div id="00:06:11.700" class="transcript_line"> There were always some secondary jobs.</div><div id="00:06:16.260" class="transcript_line"> Colin Anson, originally from Berlin, also joined the 87th Pioneer Corps in South Wales.</div><div id="00:06:23.860" class="transcript_line"> We landed up in a charming place in South Wales called Drwach the Lindray, quartered</div><div id="00:06:30.300" class="transcript_line"> in an old wool mill.</div><div id="00:06:33.500" class="transcript_line"> We used to go out on Sondre Pioneer Corps duties there, again, what had originally been</div><div id="00:06:39.100" class="transcript_line"> intended – laying mines, laying wire, various things.</div><div id="00:06:42.820" class="transcript_line"> But another rather charming development was that a band and orchestra were established.</div><div id="00:06:49.660" class="transcript_line"> This 87th Company band and orchestra used from then on to travel about in South Wales,</div><div id="00:06:55.620" class="transcript_line"> giving concerts and playing up for dances in, well, over the whole of the western part</div><div id="00:07:02.500" class="transcript_line"> of South Wales, which was great fun and which was doubly agreeable for the members of this</div><div id="00:07:09.060" class="transcript_line"> band and orchestra, because we were excused general duties and parades since we tended</div><div id="00:07:14.220" class="transcript_line"> to be out rather late.</div><div id="00:07:16.940" class="transcript_line"> For Hermann Rothmann, who had lived at Gurech Castle in Abergala in the early part of the</div><div id="00:07:22.620" class="transcript_line"> war, maintaining his Jewish identity in the army was important.</div><div id="00:07:28.900" class="transcript_line"> Hermann joined the Royal West Kent Regiment in 1944.</div><div id="00:07:32.220" class="transcript_line"> As I was a religious Jew, I had my twillen with me, you know, which you put on.</div><div id="00:07:39.820" class="transcript_line"> I always had these with me, and a small tullis.</div><div id="00:07:43.820" class="transcript_line"> And I took this always with me, because to me that was important, that I maintained my</div><div id="00:07:49.900" class="transcript_line"> religion.</div><div id="00:07:51.220" class="transcript_line"> My belief in God was not shaken in any way.</div><div id="00:07:55.580" class="transcript_line"> And I think to a certain extent, if you believe in God, that you have got somebody to fall</div><div id="00:08:02.340" class="transcript_line"> back on and to pray, and that perhaps is also a lift, which is natural, which is important</div><div id="00:08:11.380" class="transcript_line"> to you, to sustain, to be alive and to want to be, to not give in.</div><div id="00:08:19.300" class="transcript_line"> Other soldiers had to shun their Jewish heritage for the cause.</div><div id="00:08:23.860" class="transcript_line"> In 1942, a unit of commandos was created, composed almost entirely of German-speaking</div><div id="00:08:30.360" class="transcript_line"> Jewish refugees.</div><div id="00:08:32.900" class="transcript_line"> They were to carry out operations behind enemy lines, and as such needed to keep their identities</div><div id="00:08:38.540" class="transcript_line"> a secret.</div><div id="00:08:40.260" class="transcript_line"> George Lane was involved in the recruitment of what became known as X-Trip, whose base</div><div id="00:08:45.580" class="transcript_line"> was in the foothills of Errari, Snowdonia.</div><div id="00:08:49.860" class="transcript_line"> He was charged with finding suitable billets for the troops.</div><div id="00:08:54.460" class="transcript_line"> So I went to Harlech, and I went straight to the police station.</div><div id="00:08:59.220" class="transcript_line"> I explained that I had a commando troop and I had to find billets for them.</div><div id="00:09:04.660" class="transcript_line"> And they said, oh, there are plenty of empty rooms, don&#039;t you worry, it&#039;s a perfectly</div><div id="00:09:09.020" class="transcript_line"> easy matter, come with us.</div><div id="00:09:10.700" class="transcript_line"> You see, so with Constable Jones, I went all over Harlech, he knocked on the door, he said,</div><div id="00:09:17.700" class="transcript_line"> Mrs. Jones, listen to the captain.</div><div id="00:09:19.700" class="transcript_line"> So I explained, you know.</div><div id="00:09:22.100" class="transcript_line"> Mrs. Jones then said, how much they&#039;re going to pay?</div><div id="00:09:25.540" class="transcript_line"> So I said, well, the War Office gives us two pounds, actually, the allowance for that.</div><div id="00:09:29.820" class="transcript_line"> Two pounds a week?</div><div id="00:09:30.820" class="transcript_line"> After a question, go away.</div><div id="00:09:33.160" class="transcript_line"> So then Constable Jones intervened and said, well, you&#039;ve got to have them.</div><div id="00:09:37.100" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got an empty room and you should be proud of it that you&#039;re going to have a commando</div><div id="00:09:41.540" class="transcript_line"> or two.</div><div id="00:09:42.900" class="transcript_line"> So we found billets for a lot of them.</div><div id="00:09:44.820" class="transcript_line"> But I had a really sleepless night because I thought these women are going to be perfectly</div><div id="00:09:51.180" class="transcript_line"> ghastly to my chaps.</div><div id="00:09:53.220" class="transcript_line"> And I had no idea what to do.</div><div id="00:09:55.460" class="transcript_line"> Well, I needn&#039;t have worried.</div><div id="00:09:58.060" class="transcript_line"> I walked down the main street the day after my chaps arrived and these women came out</div><div id="00:10:05.580" class="transcript_line"> to their houses and they said, Captain, why didn&#039;t you tell us they were not English?</div><div id="00:10:12.420" class="transcript_line"> We would have had them for nothing.</div><div id="00:10:15.700" class="transcript_line"> Alison Williams lived in Aberdovey in Gwynedd.</div><div id="00:10:19.580" class="transcript_line"> Her family housed two ex-stripped commandos during the war.</div><div id="00:10:23.660" class="transcript_line"> One of them was Kurt Meyer, who took the pseudonym Peter Moody.</div><div id="00:10:28.340" class="transcript_line"> She remembers his time in the village.</div><div id="00:10:30.760" class="transcript_line"> He was a very gentle chap, very tall, very, very clever.</div><div id="00:10:35.480" class="transcript_line"> And actually he and my father, you see, they&#039;d be working all day or whatever and then they&#039;d</div><div id="00:10:41.160" class="transcript_line"> come back to the house.</div><div id="00:10:42.800" class="transcript_line"> Now then just bear in mind we didn&#039;t have electricity, so it was only gas and or candles.</div><div id="00:10:48.800" class="transcript_line"> And then they&#039;d be playing drafts then and they&#039;d be at it until about two o&#039;clock in</div><div id="00:10:53.960" class="transcript_line"> the morning.</div><div id="00:10:54.960" class="transcript_line"> And my mother would say, well, Moody, you need to go because you&#039;ll be on duty before</div><div id="00:11:00.200" class="transcript_line"> long, you know.</div><div id="00:11:01.920" class="transcript_line"> Because he was, Mr Evans, I&#039;m determined to beat you at this game.</div><div id="00:11:08.040" class="transcript_line"> He never did.</div><div id="00:11:11.360" class="transcript_line"> Colin Anson joined ex-troop after becoming bored with life in the Pioneer Corps.</div><div id="00:11:16.640" class="transcript_line"> He remembers his time at Aberdovey as much more rigorous.</div><div id="00:11:21.120" class="transcript_line"> The training obviously was very interesting.</div><div id="00:11:23.820" class="transcript_line"> Ours was perhaps more angled towards the intelligence side with expeditions to North Wales, the</div><div id="00:11:31.440" class="transcript_line"> Snowdonia area for mountain climbing training, rock climbing training.</div><div id="00:11:37.160" class="transcript_line"> Even if you only perhaps were going to have an intelligence lecture or compass reading</div><div id="00:11:43.000" class="transcript_line"> practice, map reading or what have you, you&#039;d first double up a mountain in order to do</div><div id="00:11:47.560" class="transcript_line"> it and then double down again and round the other side when you had finished.</div><div id="00:11:52.440" class="transcript_line"> So we were brought up to and kept at a certain stage of fitness.</div><div id="00:11:58.320" class="transcript_line"> Eventually, training finished and refugees were thrust into action in Europe.</div><div id="00:12:05.000" class="transcript_line"> For those ex-troop commandos operating behind enemy lines, capture was a very serious matter.</div><div id="00:12:12.360" class="transcript_line"> In 1942, Hitler secretly issued the Commando Order, stating that all Allied commandos captured</div><div id="00:12:19.320" class="transcript_line"> by the Germans were to be shot without trial.</div><div id="00:12:22.640" class="transcript_line"> George Lane was captured following a reconnaissance mission near Calais in May 1944.</div><div id="00:12:29.280" class="transcript_line"> He managed to convince his captors that he was a lost Navy casualty, disguising his Hungarian</div><div id="00:12:34.640" class="transcript_line"> roots by putting on his best Welsh accent.</div><div id="00:12:38.760" class="transcript_line"> They were just very unpleasant, telling me every five minutes that I&#039;m going to be shot</div><div id="00:12:43.040" class="transcript_line"> and hanged because it was obvious that I was a saboteur.</div><div id="00:12:47.080" class="transcript_line"> And although the interrogators spoke better English than I did, I managed to get away</div><div id="00:12:53.480" class="transcript_line"> with it by pretending to be a Welshman.</div><div id="00:12:56.200" class="transcript_line"> And I went on talking like a Welshman all the time, you know, and because we did all</div><div id="00:13:00.720" class="transcript_line"> our training in North Wales and it was, I wasn&#039;t deaf in those days, it was much more</div><div id="00:13:05.480" class="transcript_line"> in my ear.</div><div id="00:13:06.480" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what I sound like now because I&#039;m too deaf.</div><div id="00:13:09.480" class="transcript_line"> But then it sounded all right and they did not detect my Hungarian accent.</div><div id="00:13:16.380" class="transcript_line"> The Allies may have been closing in on German-held territory, but for Jews trapped in these countries,</div><div id="00:13:22.660" class="transcript_line"> life was becoming unimaginably grim.</div><div id="00:13:25.260" class="transcript_line"> Eva Klein, who moved to Cardiff after the war, was a Hungarian Jew coerced into becoming</div><div id="00:13:32.180" class="transcript_line"> a forced labourer by the Nazis and their Hungarian collaborators.</div><div id="00:13:37.340" class="transcript_line"> She and her family were initially moved to the De Bretsen ghetto and in 1944 were forced</div><div id="00:13:43.140" class="transcript_line"> aboard a train to Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp.</div><div id="00:13:47.900" class="transcript_line"> The railway line, however, was bombed and the train was redirected to Austria.</div><div id="00:13:53.900" class="transcript_line"> When the deportation started, we were put in cattle cars, 70, 80 people in one, one</div><div id="00:14:03.580" class="transcript_line"> bucket for that many people.</div><div id="00:14:07.700" class="transcript_line"> It didn&#039;t matter who saw you, who didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:14:11.060" class="transcript_line"> But if you have to go, you have to go and you had to do it.</div><div id="00:14:15.540" class="transcript_line"> You could hardly stand because it was no room.</div><div id="00:14:19.020" class="transcript_line"> People were standing on the top of each other.</div><div id="00:14:24.980" class="transcript_line"> When we arrived, some dead, some alive.</div><div id="00:14:29.380" class="transcript_line"> They just threw out the dead ones and they didn&#039;t know where to go.</div><div id="00:14:35.760" class="transcript_line"> In Vienna, Eva and her family were forced to work clearing rubble from bombed out buildings.</div><div id="00:14:42.360" class="transcript_line"> They were bringing in the frame from the bombs, which were in wooden frames, and we had to</div><div id="00:14:50.400" class="transcript_line"> chop them up for firewood.</div><div id="00:14:53.520" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what we did.</div><div id="00:14:54.960" class="transcript_line"> This was my main work.</div><div id="00:14:57.520" class="transcript_line"> And then with this firewood to fill up lorries and sacks of coals, we were sitting on the</div><div id="00:15:08.480" class="transcript_line"> top of the sacks in freezing cold weather and we had to schlep sacks of coals 30 kilo</div><div id="00:15:18.880" class="transcript_line"> in one sack.</div><div id="00:15:22.000" class="transcript_line"> That was our job.</div><div id="00:15:25.280" class="transcript_line"> In April 1945, the British 11th Armoured Division arrived at a camp complex near the town of</div><div id="00:15:31.400" class="transcript_line"> Bergen in northern Germany.</div><div id="00:15:34.440" class="transcript_line"> Bergen-Belsen was built as a prisoner of war camp, but over time became used as a concentration</div><div id="00:15:40.520" class="transcript_line"> camp for tens of thousands of Jews.</div><div id="00:15:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Conditions in the camp were hellish.</div><div id="00:15:47.400" class="transcript_line"> Starvation and typhus decimated the population.</div><div id="00:15:51.240" class="transcript_line"> Welsh Rabbi Leslie Hardman was the first Jewish pastor to enter the camp two days</div><div id="00:15:56.280" class="transcript_line"> after its liberation.</div><div id="00:15:58.680" class="transcript_line"> It stank a hell of a roll right to the high heavens.</div><div id="00:16:03.480" class="transcript_line"> The smell was abominable.</div><div id="00:16:06.680" class="transcript_line"> And then suddenly moved a little further and I see the hundreds of thousands of dead bodies.</div><div id="00:16:14.600" class="transcript_line"> And then in the middle of the camp there was a...</div><div id="00:16:17.560" class="transcript_line"> It was higher than this room.</div><div id="00:16:20.680" class="transcript_line"> Shoes and shoes and boots and spectacles and other bits of things.</div><div id="00:16:28.360" class="transcript_line"> And then all the lice and the other things were eating into the leather etc.</div><div id="00:16:36.120" class="transcript_line"> And this is how they were told to march around whilst the Nazis were in power.</div><div id="00:16:42.360" class="transcript_line"> The people had to walk around this terrible scene.</div><div id="00:16:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And should they try to turn their heads away they were beaten up by the SS.</div><div id="00:16:53.080" class="transcript_line"> William Richard Williams from Cardiff was one of the first British soldiers to witness</div><div id="00:16:58.200" class="transcript_line"> the liberation of Bergen-Belsen.</div><div id="00:17:01.680" class="transcript_line"> We went further on into the camp and see these corpses lying everywhere.</div><div id="00:17:07.960" class="transcript_line"> You didn&#039;t know whether they were living or dead.</div><div id="00:17:10.720" class="transcript_line"> Most of them were dead.</div><div id="00:17:12.280" class="transcript_line"> Some were trying to walk, some were stumbling, some on hands and knees.</div><div id="00:17:16.600" class="transcript_line"> But in the lagers, the barbed wire around the huts, you could see that the doors were open.</div><div id="00:17:25.640" class="transcript_line"> The stench coming out of them was fearsome.</div><div id="00:17:29.880" class="transcript_line"> They were lying in the doorways trying to get down the stairs and fall and just died on the spot.</div><div id="00:17:36.880" class="transcript_line"> Eva Klein escaped en route to Mauthausen concentration camp in Upper Austria,</div><div id="00:17:42.480" class="transcript_line"> but was recaptured and sent to Theresienstadt in Czechoslovakia.</div><div id="00:17:47.680" class="transcript_line"> The Red Army liberated the camp in May 1945.</div><div id="00:17:52.080" class="transcript_line"> And even then we didn&#039;t really believe it was the end of the war.</div><div id="00:17:56.080" class="transcript_line"> They said it was.</div><div id="00:17:59.000" class="transcript_line"> But we were still in this place.</div><div id="00:18:02.440" class="transcript_line"> We couldn&#039;t go anywhere.</div><div id="00:18:03.640" class="transcript_line"> We couldn&#039;t go out at all.</div><div id="00:18:05.240" class="transcript_line"> We couldn&#039;t even go to the yard.</div><div id="00:18:09.240" class="transcript_line"> On entering Bergen-Belsen, the immediate tasks for the Allies, including William Richard Williams,</div><div id="00:18:16.120" class="transcript_line"> were to arrange for food and medical care for the survivors and to bury the dead.</div><div id="00:18:22.440" class="transcript_line"> I think one of the more horrific sites at that time was where some of the bodies couldn&#039;t be</div><div id="00:18:30.720" class="transcript_line"> moved manually and had to be literally bulldozed along the ground into the pit.</div><div id="00:18:37.920" class="transcript_line"> This, I think, was...</div><div id="00:18:40.680" class="transcript_line"> I think we all believe that there should be dignity in death.</div><div id="00:18:45.360" class="transcript_line"> And I think this was the one aspect of the clear up which perhaps...</div><div id="00:18:51.280" class="transcript_line"> Well, it couldn&#039;t have been handled any other way.</div><div id="00:18:53.360" class="transcript_line"> There was no human way which could have been done except this.</div><div id="00:18:57.400" class="transcript_line"> But it was one of the more horrific, I think, sites of that camp.</div><div id="00:19:02.760" class="transcript_line"> Leslie Hardman officiated at the funerals of thousands of inmates at a time.</div><div id="00:19:08.040" class="transcript_line"> He recited the Kaddish, a Jewish funeral prayer.</div><div id="00:19:12.600" class="transcript_line"> We tried to do it for every single one.</div><div id="00:19:14.840" class="transcript_line"> When I did the first burial, the second burial, through 5,000 bodies,</div><div id="00:19:19.960" class="transcript_line"> some of the inmates came to stand by me.</div><div id="00:19:24.040" class="transcript_line"> And they used to comfort one another.</div><div id="00:19:27.320" class="transcript_line"> They said, look, at least your brother, your sister, our friends here,</div><div id="00:19:31.520" class="transcript_line"> at least a religious service, what we call a Yiddish word, is being mentioned over the graves.</div><div id="00:19:36.840" class="transcript_line"> We don&#039;t know whether our mothers and fathers are.</div><div id="00:19:39.440" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re probably just fertilising the ground of the Polish fields.</div><div id="00:19:43.840" class="transcript_line"> Most of them were burnt, destroyed.</div><div id="00:19:46.720" class="transcript_line"> So they used to comfort one another.</div><div id="00:19:48.120" class="transcript_line"> I said, some kind of service.</div><div id="00:19:50.320" class="transcript_line"> Survivors tried to rebuild their lives as best they could.</div><div id="00:19:55.080" class="transcript_line"> Eva Klein returned to Hungary, but had no word of the fate of two of her brothers.</div><div id="00:20:00.680" class="transcript_line"> Some people came to look for my eldest brother,</div><div id="00:20:04.320" class="transcript_line"> whom they met in Mauthaus in Gunsgatien, and they couldn&#039;t imagine why he is not home yet.</div><div id="00:20:10.960" class="transcript_line"> He had typhoid, and I think he died the last day of the war,</div><div id="00:20:18.960" class="transcript_line"> or when they were liberated.</div><div id="00:20:21.560" class="transcript_line"> But Soltán, the other brother, he was in the Russian camps.</div><div id="00:20:29.520" class="transcript_line"> As they said, he disappeared. He disappeared with the other few hundred thousands.</div><div id="00:20:40.960" class="transcript_line"> Six million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust.</div><div id="00:20:46.320" class="transcript_line"> They died in concentration camps like Bergen-Belsen and Theresienstadt.</div><div id="00:20:52.400" class="transcript_line"> They died in death camps like Auschwitz-Birkenau and Treblinka.</div><div id="00:20:58.000" class="transcript_line"> They were gassed, shot, starved, and succumbed to diseases like typhoid.</div><div id="00:21:05.800" class="transcript_line"> They were murdered for no other reason than because they were Jews.</div><div id="00:21:13.040" class="transcript_line"> In this podcast, we have explored the connections between the Holocaust and Wales.</div><div id="00:21:19.200" class="transcript_line"> We have listened to the stories of refugees who found sanctuary in Wales,</div><div id="00:21:23.680" class="transcript_line"> and the terrors from which they fled.</div><div id="00:21:27.280" class="transcript_line"> The Holocaust did not just happen to other people in another place and time.</div><div id="00:21:32.080" class="transcript_line"> It is part of all of our history.</div><div id="00:21:35.200" class="transcript_line"> By studying this history, we ensure that victims are not forgotten,</div><div id="00:21:40.280" class="transcript_line"> and hope to prevent the horrors of the Holocaust from ever being repeated.</div><div id="00:21:46.760" class="transcript_line"> Thank you for listening.</div></div></p>
