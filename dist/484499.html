What goes into preparing for a parade like this? Oh god that would take too</div><div id="00:04:09.240" class="transcript_line"> long to tell you months of work months of planning. And does the workshops that you hold before</div><div id="00:04:14.800" class="transcript_line"> the parade do they help? Oh gosh yeah that&#039;s where the costumes are made and created and as</div><div id="00:04:18.960" class="transcript_line"> you can see they&#039;re all around the car park.

I think it&#039;s very nice it&#039;s</div><div id="00:05:14.680" class="transcript_line"> amazing. I think it&#039;s very fascinating and quite international. It was completely amazing it&#039;s</div><div id="00:05:21.440" class="transcript_line"> a shame it rained but it was out of this world. There&#039;s a lot of work gone into that this it&#039;s</div><div id="00:05:26.160" class="transcript_line"> really worth coming to Cardiff to see. I think some of the costumes like the the fish and the</div><div id="00:05:32.160" class="transcript_line"> lion some of the top class costumes are amazing it&#039;s wonderful to see much bigger communities and</div><div id="00:05:38.560" class="transcript_line"> groups joining in this year and the standard of the costumes is fantastic. The stage today has</div><div id="00:05:44.720" class="transcript_line"> been absolutely round we&#039;ve had huge audiences all day so the future is bright for Cardiff carnival</div><div id="00:05:52.280" class="transcript_line"> if we can get the businesses in the city centre to come and back us that&#039;s what we need we need</div><div id="00:05:58.040" class="transcript_line"> a small amount of money for every business and then we can make it bigger and we can take over the whole weekend.</div></div></p>
