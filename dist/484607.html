    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.</div><div id="00:00:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Interviewer Steve Fletcher. Venue Swicker Office.</div><div id="00:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> The date Friday 14th November 2015.</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Interviewee Prithpal Biant.</div><div id="00:00:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Prithpal, would you be kind enough to spell your name for us and posterity?</div><div id="00:00:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, first name Prithpal, P-R-I-T-H-P-A-L.</div><div id="00:00:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Surname&#039;s Biant, B-I-A-N-T.</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much indeed.</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So, can you remember when you first came into contact with Swicker?</div><div id="00:00:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Well, I just got my first job after leaving university and it was at the Race and Equality Council.</div><div id="00:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was the Welfare Rights Officer actually, nothing to do with the arts,</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> but I think I must have said I had an interest in arts because I was always a bit,</div><div id="00:00:50.000" class="transcript_line"> anyway, I used to do a bit of arts in my own time.</div><div id="00:00:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So they said, oh, we&#039;ve got this festival thing that we&#039;re doing and, you know, we&#039;re in touch with Steve.</div><div id="00:00:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Why don&#039;t you go and, you know, see if he can help you put together the Multicultural Arts Festival,</div><div id="00:01:02.000" class="transcript_line"> which is one of the things I wanted to do.</div><div id="00:01:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So it started with that and then the REC needed a rep.</div><div id="00:01:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, you invited a rep from the REC to your board, so they picked me to be the rep.</div><div id="00:01:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So then I think I was probably on your board for, I don&#039;t know, probably at least two, maybe three years.</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I can remember you being there. What&#039;s your overriding or your general recollections?</div><div id="00:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> What was it like to be on an early Swicker board? Be honest.</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> OK. Well, I just remember sitting there and you had lots of people,</div><div id="00:01:31.000" class="transcript_line"> different people from different funding bodies like the Arts Council, Local Council and different people with different pots of money.</div><div id="00:01:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And I do remember it being a bit of a struggle. It wasn&#039;t like a positive experience.</div><div id="00:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember looking back, feeling quite sorry for you, having to defend yourself on every little point you were trying to do.</div><div id="00:01:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And, yeah, it wasn&#039;t positive. And I don&#039;t think anyone was really supporting you and saying, oh, isn&#039;t it great that you&#039;re doing this?</div><div id="00:01:55.000" class="transcript_line"> It was more like, you know, why are you doing it? More than we&#039;re really glad you&#039;re doing it, which is bizarre, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:02:00.000" class="transcript_line"> When you look back, considering how much colour and, you know, life it provides to the city.</div><div id="00:02:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think I just remember thinking, God, what a struggle it was.</div><div id="00:02:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And just the arts council, well, not well, you know, the funding bodies try to sort of sometimes compete and fight against each other.</div><div id="00:02:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was almost like if one would fund you, then the other would say, well, we won&#039;t bother them.</div><div id="00:02:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But actually, they were all on your board. But it wasn&#039;t really supportive or positive.</div><div id="00:02:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think so. I thought that&#039;s why if you&#039;re looking back and not that we are not young and vibrant at heart, but as young and vibrant people,</div><div id="00:02:33.000" class="transcript_line"> do we have any ideological differences?</div><div id="00:02:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, well, I think, yeah, well, I suppose there was there was this thing.</div><div id="00:02:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember me used to have discussions about multiculturalism versus interculturalism, which was stupid because we&#039;re all on the same side.</div><div id="00:02:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think maybe because we were all we were all fighting for money.</div><div id="00:02:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So in the voluntary sector, because my organisation was, you know, involved sector as well.</div><div id="00:02:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, from the funders point of view, if you were doing anything minority, then they&#039;d take their box.</div><div id="00:03:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So they probably only want to fund one body. So why would they want to fund two things?</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> They wouldn&#039;t want to be duplicatory. That would be a crime.</div><div id="00:03:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Exactly. Yeah. So I think that so whereas the the Multicultural Arts Festival, I was coordinated a few years before we set up.</div><div id="00:03:19.000" class="transcript_line"> That was all about celebrating different cultures in a way, keeping cultures alive because there&#039;s so many different minority communities.</div><div id="00:03:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And part of the REC&#039;s role was about saying, you know, let&#039;s be positive about the minority communities.</div><div id="00:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was my role. And then I suppose intercultural was slightly different.</div><div id="00:03:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was about everybody sharing.</div><div id="00:03:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But also, and I don&#039;t know whether if I was totally honest, I don&#039;t know, sometimes you think you&#039;re diluting and it sounds awful.</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like something my parents would probably think, you know, just pathetic.</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s rather than celebrating, it&#039;s almost like, you know, people want this.</div><div id="00:03:52.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s the Preservist Camp, isn&#039;t there? Yeah. And let&#039;s celebrate what exists now.</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Or even tradition versus innovation.</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Tradition versus fusion. Yes. Exactly. You were more fusion, weren&#039;t you? Yes.</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And I sort of nobody owned anything. It was all up for grabs.</div><div id="00:04:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s just let&#039;s all make it into a complete mess.</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Well, I was thinking, you know, it&#039;s good to know what Bengali people did with all their chalky street art stuff.</div><div id="00:04:15.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re still close to my heart.</div><div id="00:04:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And I used to love that. Or, you know, all the different ones.</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, but really there was a place for everything. Yes.</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think the environment was such that, you know, you could only have one of something that was minority, which is just ridiculous.</div><div id="00:04:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So and I think that there was some friction. It was just I just remember discussions, which I think were silly.</div><div id="00:04:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think you ever hit me, did you?</div><div id="00:04:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think so. I suspect I was probably right. You were probably bigger than me.</div><div id="00:04:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I was probably right anyway.</div><div id="00:04:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. So I remember that.</div><div id="00:04:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And then Cardiff Carnival. Yes. How? Please tell us your Cardiff Carnival story.</div><div id="00:04:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. So as well as being on the board, I did actually take part outside of work. So nothing to do with work.</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. I was I was doing a life drawing class at Chapter.</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Minding your own business.</div><div id="00:05:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. So I was turning up there and it was like in the morning, 10 till 12, I think.</div><div id="00:05:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Then either I&#039;d finished or I was late or something.</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But I saw you guys in Chapter and you were all dressed in a point.</div><div id="00:05:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I was thinking, well, that looks good fun.</div><div id="00:05:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And you just said to me, well, you can do it as well if you want. You can take part.</div><div id="00:05:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So I remember just I had colorful leggings on and trainers.</div><div id="00:05:21.000" class="transcript_line"> All I did was maybe just I just hooked this costume on.</div><div id="00:05:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So I it&#039;s like a backpack thing. So I&#039;d straps on my shoulders.</div><div id="00:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I had these gorgeous what I think were like peacock type feathers.</div><div id="00:05:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So and I think all you did was just paint my face a bit white.</div><div id="00:05:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And I just tackled along really.</div><div id="00:05:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was dancing down from Chapter all the way through Canton, I think.</div><div id="00:05:42.000" class="transcript_line"> We went down Canton High Street. And I remember dancing around St. Mary Street.</div><div id="00:05:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember exactly what the finale was, but I just remember thinking, does anybody know who I am?</div><div id="00:05:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And I didn&#039;t mind because I was all dressed up.</div><div id="00:05:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Did anybody identify you or not? Because there&#039;s anonymity in Carnival.</div><div id="00:05:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But particularly if you have a lot of people who are in a section which resemble each other.</div><div id="00:06:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, very hard to spot individuals, even if they&#039;re members of your family, I find.</div><div id="00:06:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I felt as if nobody knew it was me. You&#039;re in disguise.</div><div id="00:06:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I was definitely I put all my face with all white stuff on it.</div><div id="00:06:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And I had these peacock feathers, which I don&#039;t normally wear.</div><div id="00:06:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were pretty big. And I was dancing on the street and I wasn&#039;t drunk or anything.</div><div id="00:06:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was daylight. So I didn&#039;t think anyone recognized me.</div><div id="00:06:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was really it was a really good experience, actually.</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was just really fun. And it was totally unexpected. Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I think that&#039;s so I think that&#039;s probably the most spontaneous example of Carnival participation</div><div id="00:06:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve heard since collecting this story, which is wonderful.</div><div id="00:06:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I&#039;m not very good at planning things. I&#039;m more.</div><div id="00:06:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. So sometimes the interesting things happen to you when you don&#039;t plan.</div><div id="00:06:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely out of the blue. Yeah. So we did that. So that was quite cool.</div><div id="00:06:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was part of it. I wish I&#039;d done it more. But, you know, then you get life and as I say,</div><div id="00:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> children, family intervenes and children go, I don&#039;t want to go.</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And you think, OK, just quite right.</div><div id="00:06:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Anyway, but you&#039;ve been going and you&#039;ve got all this stuff now.</div><div id="00:06:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Five years, a quarter of a century or what I accidentally did with my life, as the project&#039;s name.</div><div id="00:07:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And is it better now? Are the board meetings better?</div><div id="00:07:06.000" class="transcript_line"> By and large, yes. Yes. Yes.</div><div id="00:07:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. The board are certainly they do what they can. Bless them.</div><div id="00:07:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I also remember you every year on year, you were struggling for survival.</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And you were always trying to trying to get three year funding, but they wouldn&#039;t give it to you.</div><div id="00:07:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Yes. So hopefully that&#039;s changed.</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s all gone the other way. So we achieved all that.</div><div id="00:07:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And in terms of funding, our hailsing days were probably at the points at which the Arts Council were offering three year funding packages.</div><div id="00:07:33.000" class="transcript_line"> The lottery was actually generating large amounts of money.</div><div id="00:07:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But so in terms of funding, the hailsing days, certainly for Carnival, were probably 10 years ago.</div><div id="00:07:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And so at the moment, for example, the local authority offers no revenue or project support for the Carnival or for Swickr or any projects in the city.</div><div id="00:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s done for two years. I mean, they pay you when you do this.</div><div id="00:07:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And they do the first thing. No reverse. We have to raise all the money and give them money to even parade on our own streets.</div><div id="00:08:02.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s got worse and worse and worse. You add to the diversity in the cultural.</div><div id="00:08:05.000" class="transcript_line"> If you were in charge of it, we would have a problem.</div><div id="00:08:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Would we? So when they say with the cap of the greatest city in Europe or whatever, the arts contribute to that.</div><div id="00:08:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So Cardiff just has the badge and doesn&#039;t support people. You&#039;ve got to add to it. Absolutely.</div><div id="00:08:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, that&#039;s not very good, is it? No. It&#039;s a bit hypocritical.</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, perhaps you should drink in the bar. Yes, why not?</div><div id="00:08:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Excellent. Prithpal, thank you very much indeed for your Carnival stories and more besides. It&#039;s been a pleasure.</div><div id="00:08:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you. Take care.</div></div></p>
