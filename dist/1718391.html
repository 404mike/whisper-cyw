    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And what about the petrol pump? What&#039;s the history behind that?</div><div id="00:00:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Well the petrol pump, the tank of that&#039;s in the garden at Cross Cottage actually,</div><div id="00:00:08.160" class="transcript_line"> with its outlet pipe. Because I think the garden, the yarded area, was enclosed by</div><div id="00:00:18.480" class="transcript_line"> gibbards. And so when I bought it there had to be a, you know, to sign a, there was a clause</div><div id="00:00:26.400" class="transcript_line"> that the land had been in possession for 20 years etc etc. But I think it was perhaps in dispute as</div><div id="00:00:32.160" class="transcript_line"> common land and John&#039;s father had built a petrol tank there before the hedging closed the ground.</div><div id="00:00:38.480" class="transcript_line"> But the petrol tank was still operational when I moved in in the early 90s and I used to fill up my</div><div id="00:00:44.640" class="transcript_line"> car there. So people would come and go for a pint or two and have their, David would come out,</div><div id="00:00:53.680" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s John&#039;s father, would come out and manually pump because it&#039;s a hand pump,</div><div id="00:00:58.880" class="transcript_line"> pump up the fuel. They put it on the tab and... Wow. So it was part of the pub really?</div><div id="00:01:05.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh part of the pub along with the, so John&#039;s got a number of businesses now of course, he&#039;s got the</div><div id="00:01:12.320" class="transcript_line"> pub, Karen runs the post office, they&#039;ve got holiday cottages, he&#039;s got the farm, he runs a bus</div><div id="00:01:20.480" class="transcript_line"> as well. But David&#039;s father of course when their family moved here they were tailors.</div><div id="00:01:28.800" class="transcript_line"> So the little holiday cottage is called Taylor&#039;s Cottage. It was a tailor&#039;s, they were tailors</div><div id="00:01:34.240" class="transcript_line"> and the shop used to sell all sorts of things, sold everything. I wish it still did. From the shop and</div><div id="00:01:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve still got some grandad shirts I bought there when John had the closing down sale</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> that were from the 1950s then, you know with the button down, the collars. So they sold everything</div><div id="00:01:53.920" class="transcript_line"> and David had a mobile van so he was ahead of his time because Tesco&#039;s van coming round now,</div><div id="00:02:01.040" class="transcript_line"> he went up in all the hills and had his round with his vegetables, bread, gammon, he had a gammon</div><div id="00:02:07.520" class="transcript_line"> slice in there, milk, that&#039;s John&#039;s father David had that, and the shop and the post office and the</div><div id="00:02:14.160" class="transcript_line"> pub and the farm. They had so many businesses and that&#039;s what you have to do, you diversify</div><div id="00:02:22.560" class="transcript_line"> and they were very enterprising people and John continues that to today.</div></div></p>
