    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is Duxie, guitarist with the Pieces of Mine.</div><div id="00:00:13.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s January 1966 in Newport. Work is well underway on the Bringglass tunnels.</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> The Seven Bridge is nine months away from being opened and we were about to support a London band called The Who</div><div id="00:00:26.000" class="transcript_line"> at Coedeva Community College in Cumbrian.</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> The gig on the 31st of January was yet another of the many promotions of Morris White from the music centre in Skinner Street.</div><div id="00:00:39.000" class="transcript_line"> We had already played a few gigs for Moe at Coedeva supporting bands such as the Mojo&#039;s and Johnny Kidd and the Pirates.</div><div id="00:00:48.000" class="transcript_line"> The Who were originally due to play in a youth centre in Newport, but it was changed probably because Moe White thought the Newport venue to be too small.</div><div id="00:00:59.000" class="transcript_line"> The Who concert file by Joe McMichael and Irish Jack Lyons still mistakenly shows the venue as Newport.</div><div id="00:01:07.000" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t, as I was there on stage at Coedeva with the Pieces of Mine as a support act.</div><div id="00:01:15.000" class="transcript_line"> By 1966 we were down to a four piece of Adrian, Percy, Phil, may he rest in peace, and myself.</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember much of the gig other than we played My Generation just as members of the Who arrived at the side of the stage.</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> They probably thought we were extremely cheeky to do this, but it was something we did quite often when supporting name groups.</div><div id="00:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Obviously when they played it our version was made to look quite amateurish, despite a fabulous bass solo from Percy.</div><div id="00:01:51.000" class="transcript_line"> When we finished our set and went backstage to the dressing area which was the gym, the Who seemed to be entertaining numerous girls, many of them within the toilets at the end of the room.</div><div id="00:02:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Moe White had a load of the My Generation album covers and arranged for the group to sign the backs so he could sell for 10 bob, which was a lot of money, in fact just less than the ticket price of 12 and a tonne.</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> My girlfriend Jackie, who came with me, managed to get one and that&#039;s the only memento I had of the gig, although I recently sold it to a collector.</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Adrian and John Beardmore both had posters signed, however John gave his to Will Lowe, so it&#039;s somewhere in Australia.</div><div id="00:02:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Adrian brought his copy across from Spain in June 2013 and John got it copied, so at least I now have a poster.</div><div id="00:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Many of those who attended our 50th anniversary reunion gig in 2013 also attended the Who gig in 1966 and I heard lots of stories about it.</div><div id="00:03:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Jerry, the 14 year old younger brother of our drummer Phil, was in the gym and managed to speak to all four of the group who he said were very friendly.</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Susan Smith and her friends caught a bus from Newport to Cumbrian and once they got into the hall they congregated to the left of the stage and then made a beeline for the centre when the Who came on.</div><div id="00:03:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Pete Townsend threw out a guitar string and a plectrum which was supposedly caught by her group, though none of them remember who had them or where they are now.</div><div id="00:03:36.000" class="transcript_line"> At one stage during the evening a fag broke out which included a boy they knew from Cumbrian who was a few years older than them.</div><div id="00:03:45.000" class="transcript_line"> They missed the bus home and ended up having to walk all the way back to Newport and she was sure they didn&#039;t tell their parents that.</div><div id="00:03:53.000" class="transcript_line"> For those who don&#039;t know the area that must have been six to eight miles depending on where in Newport they lived.</div><div id="00:04:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Jeff Cartwright worked in a factory in Cleon called Braids who made garden tools for Spear and Jackson.</div><div id="00:04:09.000" class="transcript_line"> It was his first job after leaving school.</div><div id="00:04:12.000" class="transcript_line"> At the time of the concert he was friendly with a person who played for a local band and who also worked with him in Braids.</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> His friend mentioned that if you joined the local weightlifting class there was a good chance of being asked to assist with crowd control.</div><div id="00:04:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Jeff weighed about eleven stones soaking wet and because he was a rugby player he joined.</div><div id="00:04:35.000" class="transcript_line"> His friend and he were picked and both went to the gig.</div><div id="00:04:39.000" class="transcript_line"> The actual evening was a bit of a blur for him as they were positioned right in front of the stage.</div><div id="00:04:45.000" class="transcript_line"> He said whilst they had the best view they were supposed to be looking out to the audience.</div><div id="00:04:51.000" class="transcript_line"> However his outstanding memories were a Keefe Moon smashing his drums up and throwing them about the stage</div><div id="00:04:57.000" class="transcript_line"> and Pete Townsend wrecking his guitar by banging it against the stage floor.</div><div id="00:05:03.000" class="transcript_line"> He said the girls in the audience were going mad and he had never experienced anything like it.</div><div id="00:05:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Afterwards they were guarding the dressing room and Keefe came out in a fur coat and was quite chatty.</div><div id="00:05:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Jeff said for a 17 year old who has been very lucky in life it was certainly one night you will never forget</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> and was his first and last time as a bouncer.</div><div id="00:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> His children have difficulty believing that the Who would have played in such a small place as Cumbran.</div><div id="00:05:36.000" class="transcript_line"> After the Who gig I decided that Andy who had rejoined on bass when Percy left</div><div id="00:05:42.000" class="transcript_line"> and I should have speaker cabinets look more impressive than the ones we were using.</div><div id="00:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I still had a Vox AC30 and I think Andy had a Selma bass amp.</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> We went to a hardware shop and bought several sheets of 8x4 chipboard</div><div id="00:05:59.000" class="transcript_line"> in order to make a couple of cabinets to house Fane speakers we bought from Charlie Marks.</div><div id="00:06:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Today Fane speakers seem to have acquired almost a cult status among guitarists</div><div id="00:06:12.000" class="transcript_line"> but to be honest in the 60s we bought them because they were cheap not for any supposed tonal qualities.</div><div id="00:06:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I read similar stories raving about equipment we used back then.</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Watkins dominators were not great amps.</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> In my opinion they sounded awful but because they had a funny shape and colour</div><div id="00:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> people seemed to think they must have been great.</div><div id="00:06:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Modern guitars and amplifiers are far better made than those we had access to.</div><div id="00:06:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Would I like to still have the guitars and amplifiers I used in the 60s?</div><div id="00:06:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course I would but it would be for sentimental or monetary reasons</div><div id="00:06:52.000" class="transcript_line"> not for how well they sounded or played.</div><div id="00:06:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway back to building cabinets.</div><div id="00:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Glyn remembers them as being 6 foot tall but I believe they were 8 foot</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> purely because it would have saved us cutting the chipboard.</div><div id="00:07:08.000" class="transcript_line"> The first versions were 8 foot tall, 4 foot wide and 2 foot deep and contained 4 speakers in each cabinet.</div><div id="00:07:16.000" class="transcript_line"> They were certainly heavy and a pain to transport as they nearly filled our van.</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> We tried fitting casters but they kept breaking off so we cut the cabinets in half</div><div id="00:07:28.000" class="transcript_line"> probably horizontally however it could have been vertically.</div><div id="00:07:32.000" class="transcript_line"> In the end I sort of gave in and agreed that we should go back to more manageable cabinets.</div><div id="00:07:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So was this gig special at the time?</div><div id="00:07:42.000" class="transcript_line"> To be honest to me it wasn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:07:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes it did influence our playing as a 4 piece particularly with using larger cabinets</div><div id="00:07:50.000" class="transcript_line"> but it&#039;s only time that it&#039;s shown what an achievement it was.</div><div id="00:07:55.000" class="transcript_line"> This was hammered home to me when Rod Gilbert mentioned it after a clip of us was used on the Graham Norton show in June 2016.</div><div id="00:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So thanks Moe, we will always remember you.</div><div id="00:08:20.000" class="transcript_line"> you</div></div></p>
