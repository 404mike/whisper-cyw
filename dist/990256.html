Please tell me if you&#039;ve done nothing.</div><div id="00:02:43.500" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a tale as it would be told in Wenglish.</div><div id="00:02:47.500" class="transcript_line"> Again, I must remind you, half of Wales, the population of Wales,</div><div id="00:02:52.500" class="transcript_line"> doesn&#039;t have much Welsh culture at all.</div><div id="00:02:56.500" class="transcript_line"> This is how a tale would have been told in Wenglish.</div><div id="00:03:05.500" class="transcript_line"> If I&#039;m going to create a disaster, then I want you to be a part of it.</div><div id="00:03:10.000" class="transcript_line"> In this tale, in Wales, they love to make exclamations.</div><div id="00:03:15.000" class="transcript_line"> When you do something, they go, well, well, well.</div><div id="00:03:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, good people, I&#039;m going to put a cap on you.</div><div id="00:03:23.000" class="transcript_line"> When I raise my cap, you&#039;ve got to say, well, well, well.</div><div id="00:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s also a part in it where when I raise this to my eyes,</div><div id="00:03:38.500" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ve got to go, oh.</div><div id="00:03:45.500" class="transcript_line"> Now, one of the aspects of Wenglish is,</div><div id="00:03:49.500" class="transcript_line"> they drop their H&#039;s, or H&#039;s if you say it right.</div><div id="00:03:54.500" class="transcript_line"> They drop their H&#039;s.</div><div id="00:03:56.500" class="transcript_line"> So, in my narration, and I&#039;m totally indebted to John Edwards,</div><div id="00:04:00.500" class="transcript_line"> not totally, sorry, put some stuff in there.</div><div id="00:04:03.500" class="transcript_line"> In my narration, in the towns of this tale,</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to have to try and remember to drop me H&#039;s.</div><div id="00:04:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, if you can catch me not having dropped an H,</div><div id="00:04:17.000" class="transcript_line"> then I see here, from my pocket money,</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got one beer ticket left, right, even though.</div><div id="00:04:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But there&#039;s also a catch, you see.</div><div id="00:04:27.000" class="transcript_line"> If I catch you not going, well, well, well,</div><div id="00:04:31.000" class="transcript_line"> then I get a beer of you, right?</div><div id="00:04:33.500" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a very, what much we better practice before we go.</div><div id="00:04:39.500" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got to put a feeling into, well, well, well.</div><div id="00:04:46.500" class="transcript_line"> And then we&#039;re good to go.</div><div id="00:04:51.500" class="transcript_line"> This is a tale, I&#039;ve seen, I&#039;ve got a pint of you,</div><div id="00:04:57.500" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been losing this beer ticket straight away,</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> oh, thank you, thank you.</div><div id="00:05:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Very sad tale this, of Llywelyn and Gellert.</div><div id="00:05:11.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve all heard the story of Llywelyn,</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Prince of Wales, haven&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:05:16.000" class="transcript_line"> But you&#039;ll remember, he lived many years ago, he did,</div><div id="00:05:21.000" class="transcript_line"> when we had our own Prince of Wales,</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> not one of those from our England wave.</div><div id="00:05:27.500" class="transcript_line"> Well, well, well.</div><div id="00:05:29.500" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no, no folks, you&#039;ve got it right.</div><div id="00:05:31.500" class="transcript_line"> Well, well, well.</div><div id="00:05:34.500" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll have to do that again, try.</div><div id="00:05:36.500" class="transcript_line"> Well, well, well.</div><div id="00:05:38.500" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ll come out.</div><div id="00:05:41.500" class="transcript_line"> This is the story of Llywelyn and his beautiful dog Gellert.</div><div id="00:05:47.500" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve got to warn you, it&#039;s a hell of a sad story.</div><div id="00:05:51.500" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So, have your Anki ready in case.</div><div id="00:05:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Llywelyn had been given Gellert back by his father-in-law,</div><div id="00:06:04.000" class="transcript_line"> King John of England.</div><div id="00:06:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, well.</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Great dog he was, by all accounts.</div><div id="00:06:12.000" class="transcript_line"> A real Bremmer, do they do say.</div><div id="00:06:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Llywelyn had taken a real fancy to him.</div><div id="00:06:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Nobody could touch him when there was an Anton in the woods,</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> and mountains around was Llywelyn and his castle.</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Like a winky he was, fearless he was, man.</div><div id="00:06:30.000" class="transcript_line"> It isn&#039;t, but he was like a lamb around the house.</div><div id="00:06:34.500" class="transcript_line"> Real gentle he was, what I tell you.</div><div id="00:06:37.500" class="transcript_line"> You could do anything with him.</div><div id="00:06:39.500" class="transcript_line"> You could, must have been a real smasher.</div><div id="00:06:43.000" class="transcript_line"> The kind you don&#039;t see every day, is it?</div><div id="00:06:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, well, well.</div><div id="00:06:49.000" class="transcript_line"> This particular day, when there was all set</div><div id="00:06:52.000" class="transcript_line"> to go out for a day&#039;s hunting,</div><div id="00:06:54.000" class="transcript_line"> the huntsman blew his horn, took all the owls together,</div><div id="00:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> and all the others came running out right off.</div><div id="00:07:02.000" class="transcript_line"> But will you credit it, there was no sign of Gellert.</div><div id="00:07:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, well, well.</div><div id="00:07:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Oy, oy, must be something up, said the prince.</div><div id="00:07:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Must be something up.</div><div id="00:07:15.000" class="transcript_line"> But we can&#039;t hang around here for any longer,</div><div id="00:07:19.000" class="transcript_line"> because it looks like we&#039;ll come under rain.</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Fair play.</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> You would see him when they, to get back from the hunt.</div><div id="00:07:28.000" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t have much luck on that hunt that day.</div><div id="00:07:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Who got it? You did?</div><div id="00:07:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, the only one I got.</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Got any more money, love?</div><div id="00:07:47.000" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t have much luck on the hunt that day.</div><div id="00:07:50.000" class="transcript_line"> It was obviously going to have done with Gellert back at that hunt.</div><div id="00:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, my God.</div><div id="00:07:56.000" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t seem to be much shape to do anything without him.</div><div id="00:08:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, well, he was down in the dumps proper</div><div id="00:08:03.000" class="transcript_line"> when they all got home from a bit of grub.</div><div id="00:08:06.000" class="transcript_line"> What a real second he had with hunting that day.</div><div id="00:08:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, well, well.</div><div id="00:08:13.000" class="transcript_line"> As the prince jumped down from his horse,</div><div id="00:08:16.000" class="transcript_line"> out came Gellert to meet him.</div><div id="00:08:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Master wagged his tail back and forth, back and forth.</div><div id="00:08:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Back and forth.</div><div id="00:08:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Gellert came out to meet him, wagging his tail back and forth, back and forth.</div><div id="00:08:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Jumping up and down, he was all over the moon.</div><div id="00:08:54.000" class="transcript_line"> He was thrilled to bet to get his master home to his captor&#039;s house.</div><div id="00:09:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Oi! Good boy!</div><div id="00:09:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, boy, such a well-in. Yeah, boy.</div><div id="00:09:05.000" class="transcript_line"> But when he bent down to stroke the dog</div><div id="00:09:08.000" class="transcript_line"> and make a bit of fuss about him like it shook him rigid,</div><div id="00:09:13.000" class="transcript_line"> the owens&#039; jaws and fangs were all dripping with blood</div><div id="00:09:19.000" class="transcript_line"> and a real sight for so eyes he looked.</div><div id="00:09:25.000" class="transcript_line"> The prince, I can tell you, spoke sharp to the dog.</div><div id="00:09:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Worried sick he was now about his little toot of a baby&#039;s son, see,</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> because he used to leave Gellert in charge of the little toot, now and again, off and on.</div><div id="00:09:39.000" class="transcript_line"> He rushed up the stairs, taking two and three by the time to find his little boy,</div><div id="00:09:45.000" class="transcript_line"> and he was flabbergasted to see the walls and floor covered with blood.</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Dear Maury said, had everybody looked, it was shanty bang,</div><div id="00:09:57.000" class="transcript_line"> blood to be had all over the place, and as he rushed frantic from moon to moon,</div><div id="00:10:03.000" class="transcript_line"> his dad was in his boots, because he couldn&#039;t find hide nor air of his son.</div><div id="00:10:15.000" class="transcript_line"> He shouted and he shouted for all he was worth, but Maury answered.</div><div id="00:10:20.000" class="transcript_line"> On he went, shouted and bawling and getting more work up all the time,</div><div id="00:10:25.000" class="transcript_line"> as he went rushing about the whole place,</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> and an eye low for his buck and back, he didn&#039;t know which way to turn,</div><div id="00:10:33.000" class="transcript_line"> really, worked himself up into a real prasmy head.</div><div id="00:10:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And at last he found his baby&#039;s cot, all turned over on his side, all skewed over it was,</div><div id="00:10:46.000" class="transcript_line"> but no sign of the boy, and the whole place was in hell of a mess.</div><div id="00:10:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, a well-dead and sore killer, standing by his side, fair play,</div><div id="00:10:59.000" class="transcript_line"> the fearful owned and left his master for a minute, like a shadow in a beak.</div><div id="00:11:06.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve owned a bell, he said, you&#039;ve owned a bell, you&#039;ve killed my son, he said.</div><div id="00:11:14.000" class="transcript_line"> There was me thinking I could trust you, pumping mad he was, pumping mad he was.</div><div id="00:11:21.000" class="transcript_line"> By then, pumping mad he was, by then he had to have his revenge.</div><div id="00:11:27.000" class="transcript_line"> He pulled out his sword and he pushed it right down into poor old Gillard&#039;s eye.</div><div id="00:11:39.000" class="transcript_line"> You should have seen him, you should have seen the look in Gillard&#039;s eye.</div><div id="00:11:46.000" class="transcript_line"> You should have heard him howl.</div><div id="00:11:49.000" class="transcript_line"> You should have seen him sank down and die.</div><div id="00:11:55.000" class="transcript_line"> What with all the palaver, with Gillard whining and whining and whining and dying.</div><div id="00:12:03.000" class="transcript_line"> He died and Llewellyn shouting fit to burst.</div><div id="00:12:09.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not surprising that when all was over, the prince could hear another sound now.</div><div id="00:12:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Faint it was, but enough for him to hear it tidy.</div><div id="00:12:26.000" class="transcript_line"> It was obvious that the little toot was crying.</div><div id="00:12:32.000" class="transcript_line"> In two shapes, Llewellyn was over the other side of the room,</div><div id="00:12:35.000" class="transcript_line"> and there he found his baby son safe and sound, with a scratch on his bottom, a mark on his clothes.</div><div id="00:12:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And underneath the couch was lying there was a big, huge, huge wolf.</div><div id="00:12:57.000" class="transcript_line"> You could tell he hadn&#039;t been dead that long.</div><div id="00:13:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Now of course, Llewellyn could see what had happened.</div><div id="00:13:05.000" class="transcript_line"> It dawned on him like he could see how Gillard had got himself covered with blood.</div><div id="00:13:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Fighting and killing the wolf to stop him getting at the little one.</div><div id="00:13:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Hero you are, hero.</div><div id="00:13:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Not a rogue, Llewellyn had thought.</div><div id="00:13:22.000" class="transcript_line"> The prince was in hell of a state.</div><div id="00:13:25.000" class="transcript_line"> He was in hell of a state.</div><div id="00:13:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And you can imagine, you could see how hasty he had been,</div><div id="00:13:31.000" class="transcript_line"> and how he had gone and killed poor Gillard when he was down doing his job tidy,</div><div id="00:13:37.000" class="transcript_line"> and protecting his son from harm.</div><div id="00:13:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But there was no use carrying on aching and tucking,</div><div id="00:13:44.000" class="transcript_line"> and saying, pray, old Gillard.</div><div id="00:13:48.000" class="transcript_line"> If only I&#039;d stopped to think a minute, I&#039;d kill the finest dog I&#039;ve ever had.</div><div id="00:13:55.000" class="transcript_line"> The wicked deed had been done,</div><div id="00:13:58.000" class="transcript_line"> and there was nothing you could do now to put things right for poor old Gillard.</div><div id="00:14:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So Llewellyn was sorry in his heart now,</div><div id="00:14:06.000" class="transcript_line"> and he had a great big grave made for Gillard,</div><div id="00:14:11.000" class="transcript_line"> and they got to put up a monument over it,</div><div id="00:14:15.000" class="transcript_line"> and there he hung his hunting horn and his spear to show them how sorry he was for what he&#039;d done.</div><div id="00:14:21.000" class="transcript_line"> If you&#039;re ever up in that part of Wales,</div><div id="00:14:24.000" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;d better be ready to be in the woods,</div><div id="00:14:27.000" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;d better be ready to be in the woods.</div><div id="00:14:29.000" class="transcript_line"> If you&#039;re ever up in that part of Wales,</div><div id="00:14:32.000" class="transcript_line"> have a look for a little place called Beard Gillard.</div><div id="00:14:36.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s where you will find where Gillard is buried,</div><div id="00:14:41.000" class="transcript_line"> because that&#039;s what it means in Welsh.</div><div id="00:14:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Beard Gillard, Gillard&#039;s grave.</div><div id="00:14:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And by the way, if I can tell you one of my wanglish,</div><div id="00:14:50.000" class="transcript_line"> as with all lovely tales from Wales, there&#039;s a moral to it,</div><div id="00:14:54.000" class="transcript_line"> and the moral to this one is,</div><div id="00:14:55.000" class="transcript_line"> if you find yourself in a bloody mess,</div><div id="00:14:59.000" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t take a stab at cleaning it up.</div></div></p>
