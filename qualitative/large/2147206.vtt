00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.000
Yes, can you please introduce yourself please?

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.240
My name is Raquel Smith.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.140
My name is Raquel Smith.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.800
Can you tell us where you were born and yeah, can you tell us about what it was like growing up there as well?

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.340
I was born in Pakistan, near Jannamwala, Faisalabad.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.340
I was born in Pakistan, near Jannamwala, Faisalabad.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.980
I was born in Pakistan, near Jannamwala, Faisalabad.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:37.760
District Faisalabad.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.480
What was it like growing up there?

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.740
It was very nice. We had a small family.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.440
My father was...

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.180
in England.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.320
He was in army first and then he came to England to work.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:12.200
While I was with my mother, grandmother and brother.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.220
So we were living there happily.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.360
How old was you when your father was travelling to England?

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.320
How old was you when your father was travelling to England?

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.320


00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.600
We came to this country when I was 14.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.600
What do you remember? What kind of games did you play in Pakistan?

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:49.280
I remember playing in the streets, sort of an open place.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.140
Because even in the houses we have a yard where we play together, children come around.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.440
And we play in the streets as well.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.720
In our time it was very safe to play there.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.300
Have you got a favourite memory of your childhood?

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:19.980
My favourite memory could be my grandmother being there and friends coming around to play.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.660
And we used to sit together and listen to grandmother's stories.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.100
And having good fun really.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.000
Because there was no TV or radio at that time.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.600
Is there a certain story you can remember from your grandmother?

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.560
Not really. No.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.720
I only remember just talking about different things.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.640
And is there an event? An event that you remember?

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.640


00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.580
An event or a gathering that really stands out to you that you had while you were still in Pakistan?

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.720
I remember Christmas times.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.080
Because I'm Christian.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.440
So Christmas time was a big thing.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:17.040
And because my father was abroad, we were known as a well-off family.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.980
And he would send money.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.260
And Christmas time, all the people in our room nearby,

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.620
all the people in our room nearby,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.700
would get together in our house and little presents were given to them.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.180
And it would be really a joyful time.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.780
Mixing with children.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.280
And it wasn't a massive big presents.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.820
It was small presents and some fruit given and things like that.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.240
So we weren't spoiled or given large big things.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.440
So then, you're 14 years old.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.900
And you're travelling to the UK.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.000
What made you decide to come to the UK?

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.520
It was my father and my titus over.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.600
The mother, my brother and myself.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.200
It was hard in a sense.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.880
Mother was very excited.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.820
She's meeting her husband and going abroad.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.320
I don't understand why I wasn't happy.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.140
Because I was leaving everything I knew behind, I think.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.820
All the aunties, uncles, all the friends behind.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.440
But it was good as well.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.400
Happiness as well.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.480
But still it was sad as well, deep down.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.700
Leaving the country.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.760
Was there anything you were expecting?

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.920
Did you have a vision inside your mind of what the UK was going to look like?

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.000
Not really, no.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.980
Being 14 years old, it was quite a...

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.440
It was hard to just think why we have to leave and go.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.900
And when we came here, going to the school was the biggest thing.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.780
I didn't know the language.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.380
Even though I went to school in Pakistan, but it was all in Urdu.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.160
And we just started doing English at my age.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.300
You start in class six, I think.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:23.500
English.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.120
And then...

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.320
I knew a bit to read and write.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.580
But to speak, there was no chance.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.280
Especially even if you can speak when you come here, accent and everything.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.600
Really, it takes time.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.700
I agree.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.660
So that was a big, big superpower.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.780
So then, so you travelled by plane, coming to the UK.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.260
It was by plane?

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.720
Yeah, we came by plane.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.580
Where did you...

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.540
Can you remember where you landed?

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.500
Heathrow.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.440
Heathrow and straight to Newport.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.440
I've been in Newport over 50 years now.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:08.380
Wow.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.960
That's amazing.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.520
And was there any particular reason why your father was in Newport?

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.020
Or why you came to Newport?

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.620
Yeah, he was actually in Bradford because he had friends there.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.940
And they were more, I think, industrial factories around there.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:34.720
But he had a friend from Johnawalla, where we're from, in Wales.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.960
And he invited him over from Bradford.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.420
He said, come and join us here.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.860
Now your family is coming.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.820
Come here so we can meet together.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.600
So that was the reason.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.600
And of course, you were...

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.820
Is there a certain memory that really sticks out to you when you arrived into Newport?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.720
Or around the time that you were settling in Newport?

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.500
Yes, there are a lot of memories.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.600
The particular one is changing of clothes.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.160
From Pakistani clothes.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:17.860
We had to wear English clothes, like in school, skirt and things.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.540
That was very daunting.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.840
It was very strange after being covered.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.800
We had to wear those clothes.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.860
That was one of the memories that really sticks out.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.820
Yeah, that's something.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.700
That's the first time I'm hearing that actually.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:36.720
Someone mentioning that.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.920
Because you wouldn't think as much how clothes do play a factor.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.420
Because that's what you're wearing at home.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.340
That's what you're wearing when you play everywhere.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.480
Everyone, you know, Pakistanis, they're coming here.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:47.960
Yeah.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.420
It's not everyone.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.700
It's just my father was...

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.280
I think you got to mix with the culture.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:03.880
And being a Christian, we didn't have restrictions like you got to be covered.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.540
Even though in Pakistan there was no difference.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:12.060
Because that's what you call national costume.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.940
Here, to him, national costume was what he wanted.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.120
And to him, it was one of the kÃ¤yttig.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.640
Now, many of us are dressed like that.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:33.640
So, we thought we should dress like this.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.540
So, it was kind of like, not like the...

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.760
This is like wearing clothes, old European outfit.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.780
Thank you very much for your time.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:47.940


00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:52.800
written down. They would write down for me and there was no other help around.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:59.140
So how about friends? Did you start kind of growing friends as well or the more that you

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:05.640
were being settled inside of Newport? Yes, we made friendship. My main friends were Pakistani

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:13.640
people because of the language and some of them are still my friends. We kept on

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:23.420
as family friends after. Where in Newport have you lived actually, since you've been here for 50 years?

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:33.480
I live around the Hanpost area, you know, Ruska road. We moved around a bit.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:40.780
I think very first time we came, the first home was in Pill, my father was there and then

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.620
from there we moved to Mendy.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:49.220
lived in the main area and then the rest of my life I've been in the hand post area, up

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.440
and down streets.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.200
Yeah, because you're quite high up now actually, going up the hand post.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.860
Does that mean that you used to go to Bellevue Park and things like that as well?

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.200
Yeah, I lived at Bellevue Park and still do.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:08.660
It's one of the things, really memories are there.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:12.700
Because from school we would walk to the Bellevue Park before we go home.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.440
I went to Dufferin High.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.040
So Bellevue Park is quite an important park in my life.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:29.780
So after coming here, did any of your friends from Pakistan or even family, other family

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.240
members join you in Newport?

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:32.960
No.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.680
Because it wasn't easy to get visas and things.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.540
How about you?

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.320
Have you travelled to Pakistan?

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.380
Have you been able to?

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.420
My mum and my husband used to go more often.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.420
But my husband hasn't come yet.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.880
He came too early.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.060
But when I got married I went back.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.140
I did not go before that.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.500
Yes, we got a big connection at this moment in Pakistan.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.000
We started a charity.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.860
There is an inner village nearby.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:12.900
Where I'm from.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:18.740
Which is running a school for poor children in a small village.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.100
And they needed a church as well.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.920
So they built up a church.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.060
A school is our responsibility.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.960
I got all the community here involved in it.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.200
And it's going really well.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.140
So we got a big connection there.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.780
We go up and down.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.640
And with the media now, we're on the video calls.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.840
And so it's good.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.280
It's really important.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.960
When I was young, I didn't have that connection.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.400
The only stories I will get is when mum will go back.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.740
Or my husband will go back.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.780
But now I've been a few times.

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:07.120
What does that connection feel like for you to have now?

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.820
Is it a connection that you didn't have when you were younger?

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.600
What does it feel to have that now?

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.360
And to also provide it for other people?

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.600
It is really satisfying, the connection is.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.380
It's keeping in touch with your roots.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.380
And plus, we're trying to change lives of people.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.380
We've got a good life here.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.620
And those children did not have any education.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:30.560
No school.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:35.080
And it is really satisfactory.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.300
That you can make a change in people's life.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:39.960
And the project.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.060
And the project.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.960
When we were asked to do something for the village.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.620
And I'm not from the village.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:47.620
Or my husband's not.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.140
And it was just a pastor reached us.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.380
And asked us if we can help.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.680
Because they think people living abroad are rich.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.760
And they can do anything.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.840
But we said we will go back and find out.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.140
And let you know.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.420
So we took up this responsibility.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.660
And God is always there to help us through.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:12.000
Because fundraising is not an easy job.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.360
And we are getting there.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.520
And we got the building.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:16.920
Which is really lovely.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.420
And the children seeing their behavior.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.660
Running around from the street.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.040
To being, sitting down to get some education.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.580
This we're changing for the country.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.720
These children and changing their families.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:38.000
It's really satisfying project.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.700
And this, like I said.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.180
All my friends.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.280
Everybody I know.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.680
Is always willing to help.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.600
With fundraising.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.080
Or anything they can do.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.020
It's always there.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.200
It's amazing.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.180
Amazing to hear.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.560
And that togetherness that you just mentioned.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.660
Your friends and people that are around you here.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:00.940
And also assisting you.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.720
In fundraising.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.280
This is without any religion.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.780
Without any restrictions.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:07.940
We are just friends.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.300
We try to work for this community.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:11.820


00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.840
And speaking of work.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.560
What type of jobs have you kind of had.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.400
While you've been here in Newport?

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.080
I have worked in shops.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.480
Like shop assistants.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.500
I think little time in a factory as well.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.580
Production factory.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.500
But my main job.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.580
Being in school.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.860
As a language support worker.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.000
And a under five development worker.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.580
And I think that's where my real heart is.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.300
To see children progress.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.300
And get into life.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.200
Education is the only way I believe.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.500
To change people.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.060
To give you progress.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.780
And I've done a lot of.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.640
Since I retired.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.300
I'm a voluntary worker.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.320
So.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:05.940
Thank you.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.660
And can you tell us a bit more about your family.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.320
In terms of your husband.

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.200
And then how that came about.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.800
And then growing up from there as well.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.080
In terms of you being married.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.180
Yes I was married at the age of 31.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.220
And it was arranged marriage.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.660
And we have lived happily since then.

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.740
And it's 47 years now.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:35.780
And we have three daughters.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:36.820
We have three girls.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.780
Who are very successfully educated.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:40.640
And.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.180
Settling their life.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.440
And six grandchildren.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.760
Can be hurtful when they're together.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.140
So then.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.500
Balancing your work.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.440
And family.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.180
And being in this environment as well.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.640
What kind of other things.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:03.740
In terms of groups.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:04.920
Or anything like that.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:05.440
Did you start.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.060
Being exposed to or did you start joining any groups.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:09.400
Yeah.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.680
So while you were here in Newport.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.980
Basically I joined the groups when I retired.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:18.800
And.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.780
I was looking for where to go.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:25.380
What to do.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.340
I started to go into coffee and laugh at Eton Road.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.180
And from there.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:30.460
A friend.

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:31.380
Sookra.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.060
Introduced me to Rachel Life.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.700
And Rachel Life is a very.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:40.760
Successful.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.360
Very.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:45.260
Friendly.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:48.020
Satisfying.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.460
It's like a family group now.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.600
Because I've been going to it.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.040
For about ten years.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.800
So I can make a place.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.500
And I'm a secretary for the group.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.780
Once you're with Rachel Life.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.380
You always got a job there.

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:08.300
They get you to do everything.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:09.700
Roy.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.260
Who runs Rachel Life.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:13.840
Is a.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.460
Person who gives his 100% to it.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.720
And he expects everybody else to be.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.420
Give their life to it.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.120
But I do try my best.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.700
And try to do what I can.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.460
But it is a group that.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.300
Everybody should join.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:33.260
It's.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.140
It's so satisfying.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.780
It's given people a home.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:39.620
Like.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.540
Some people got nobody.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.440
Once they join.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.740
Rachel Life.

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.420
You got a family there.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.360
You are really.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.600
Friends with everybody.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.140
Everybody's willing to help.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:55.520
Fantastic.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.300
Thank you.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.120
Thank you very much.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.020
I don't know if there's anything.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.220
Else that you would like to share at all.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:00.320
Thank you.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:00.320


00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:00.320


00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.660
That's all really.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:05.680
JENNY GOJEAN- Yeah.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:09.060
Wonderful.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.400
