00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
I'm Vicki MacDonald and I'm at Holy Trinity Church, Llandudno, during the longest yarn.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:11.520
And I'm speaking to Wendy Lonsdale, who has memories of her parents during the war.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.500
Wendy, what do you want to tell me?

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:20.020
Well, I was born in 1941, so I was always called a war baby.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:31.280
My mother used to, we lived actually in Port Hague, and we had an antique business in Port Maddock.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:41.960
So when the phony war came, my mother panicked and thought that the Germans were going to land on Black Rock Sands.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.140
And so she started taking all her valuable antiques down into the cellar until, I think,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.000
my father...

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.780
My father told her not to be so silly.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.680
So that was the first story that I can recall.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.940
And I do remember that my father was in the Home Guard in the first few years of the war.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:18.580
And he was stationed up below Snowdon, near Capel Kirig, guarding the line, the pipeline, which was water.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.000
I gather it was a...

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.000


00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.000


00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.000


00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.260
The water.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.000
Yes.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.120
But I didn't hear very much about that.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:36.020
And then at the beginning of the war, anybody who had a house with a spare bedroom was told they had to take members of the services,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.160
or they had to have somebody to live with them.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.320
So my mother decided, or evacuees.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.880
So my mother said, oh, well, we've got the premises above the shop.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.780
We'll go down to the shop and live over the shop in Port Maddock.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.220
And we'll let a family come and live in our house in Borthagest.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.020
And I'm not quite sure how long we were there, but I was born over the shop.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.540
And I remember my mother saying to her mother, well, I don't remember this, but she told me this,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.000
that, oh, I can't possibly have a baby over the shop.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.660
And my grandmother apparently said, you'd be surprised.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.160
I swear you can have a baby.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.040
So during the war, obviously, I was a baby.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.340
And my mother took me on the...

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.100
I think we must have had a...

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.660
We went by taxi, I think, to Liverpool, because that's where her mother and father lived in Liverpool,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.460
but not in Liverpool itself, out in Great Crosby.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.720
And my grandmother apparently used to say, they'd telephone and say,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.560
do you think it's safe?

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.020
Do you think it's safe to come?

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.340
And my grandmother said, well, there haven't been any bombs recently.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.120
I think you're safe to come.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.320
So then apparently I was taken as a baby in arms up to Liverpool.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.740
And as soon as we got there, the bombs started dropping.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.100
And nearly the end of the war, my father had then been called up because he was older.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.540
He was called up and he was in the Royal Corps of Signals and doing, learning how to do,

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.520
you know, codes and things like that.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.760
And he was...

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.880
I remember he was in Scarborough.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.660
And for some reason, we went to stay in Scarborough.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.780
We went on the train.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:38.560
And I can remember going on the train and all the soldiers on the train sort of making a big fuss of me

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.220
because I was a, you know, little girl.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.240
And we got to Scarborough and stayed there a few days, I suppose.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.220
Those are my earliest memories.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.220
Thank you.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.860
And you told me one memory about your mother and the knives.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.900
Yes.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.040
So because it was an antique shop, she had a lot of, well, knives,

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.760
very, obviously, very dangerous knives from the Far East.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.080
And there were Dutch commandos stationed, I think, near Harlech.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:16.040
And they came into the shop and wanted to know if she had any sharp knives

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.900
because we'll get these.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.700
And so and so.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.060
They were going out to the Far East.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.120
They were being...

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.780
They were stationed.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.120
She sold them, the knives?

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.520
Oh, yes.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.920
Yeah.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.220
She sold whatever she had.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.860
She was glad to get rid of them, I think.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.200
What else was...

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.920
So you had...

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.620
Your mother had quite a busy wartime.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.320
There were other memories?

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.160
And the other...

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.320
Yes.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.020
Well, so then talking about the being...

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.760
Because I was born in...

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.540
Over the shop, as it were.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.000
The house...

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.720
Was...

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.100
She obviously...

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.540
Sorry, I stopped the tape for a moment.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.960
Wendy's going to continue.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:03.120
Just to say that a family came from London and lived in our house during the war.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.660
It was a vacu-ease.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.960
Well, I suppose you'd call them a vacu-ease, but yes, it was a family.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.600
It was instead of having soldiers, I suppose,

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.680
because otherwise we'd have had soldiers living in it.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.080
And it was a very nice bungalow in Forth a Guest.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.880
So thank you, Wendy.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.660
Thank you for your wonderful memories of the war and your mother's war as well.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.840
So did your...

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.660
She survived it all and...

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.980
Oh, yes.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.860
The antique shop stayed open after the war, did she?

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.460
Indeed, yes.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.720
She did.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.000
Until 1950s.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.320
Of course.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.180
1950s, yes.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.140
Oh, that was lovely.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.160
Thank you so much.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.060
Thank you for doing that.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.140
Thank you.
