00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940
I am married to a gorgeous husband called Mark in Ambulennet.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.940
We got married 2014, September the 5th, 2014.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.660
It was the best day of my life I could think of.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.820
A lot of people turned up, Mark's family turned up.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.540
Glad in a way that my family didn't turn up because I didn't want them there.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:49.160
Basically it was a very emotional time of day because I absolutely broke into tears and whatever because it was an emotional day.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.740
Mark's family broke into tears as well.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.280
We got emotional and upset.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.980
Some of my friends were...

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.540
upset on the day because of me getting married.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.480
Happy upset?

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.500
Happy.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.520
How did Mark propose?

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.060
With a wedding ring.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.220
With a wedding ring?

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.940
Yeah.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.520
Did he plan?

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.160
What happened, we got married in a posh hotel in a...

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.240
I can't remember the name of the place but the hotel...

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.980
I don't think the hotel...

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.860
The hotel's there anymore.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.900
I think it's closed down or somebody's overtaken it.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.780
Basically we stayed in a hot tub and the hot tub was absolutely out of this world.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:55.620
We were in the hot tub fully naked and we were both absolutely pissed out of our heads.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.680
I meant we were drunk.
