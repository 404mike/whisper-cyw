00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:20.400
Jill Jones talking to Shirley Davis, continuation. So Shirley, when the Minera Limestone quarry closed, can you tell me a little bit about what happened next there?

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:33.660
Yes, it was closed for quite some time and there were a number of us in the village who were quite concerned about what was going to happen in the line works, what the future of it was going to be.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:46.240
Because it was an area where many of us did walk, but it was becoming very overgrown, we were finding it more and more difficult to get in and out of there.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:58.460
And we heard via my husband actually, who was on the council at the time, that it was up for sale.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:09.340
And as a result of this, a few of us got together. We got together in the City Arms, which was a pub that was open at the time.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.220
And at that first meeting I was appointed as the Chair of the City Arms.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.220


00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.840
And we were part of a new group which was looking into what we could do about the quarry, about the line works.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.240
We then went for a brainstorming session, which was up in the cycle centre up in Llandellia.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:43.680
And we formed a committee and from that committee we then decided that we were going to do our level best

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.220
to get it for the pupils who were going to be in the quarry.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:56.000
And we had a meeting with the community of Monera, for them to have it as a facility for the whole area.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.760
Yes, as an outdoor general access.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.420
Yes.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.600
And many of the meetings went on in my house.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:05.700
Yes.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.620
It was open house and we continued to meet.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.300
We struggled, we really really struggled very hard.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.220
Trying to get the work done.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.060
Trying to get people to listen to us.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.620
And to agree to us doing, having something done with it.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.340
Yes.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:31.220
And it was only eventually when we managed to get the North Wales Wildlife Trust on board with us

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.380
that we were able to secure it for the people of the community and make it a facility.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.920
Rather than what was becoming an eyesore and a problem.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.880
Yes.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.640
So we...

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.060
I then stepped down from being the chairperson.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.780
Yes.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.580
And it was taken over.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.140
And there had been a couple of chairmen after that.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.880
Yes.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:04.300
But I'm quite pleased to say that as a result of the efforts that the group made, it wasn't just me but it was the group.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.440
Yes, the committee was really good and hard working.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.120
Absolutely.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.880
Yes.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.520
And met on a regular basis and we managed eventually to...

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.980
to get the Wildlife Trust on board and with their help and what have you.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.560
Yes.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.500
It's now a good...

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.440
It is.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.980
It's a good local...

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.880
Facility.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.360
Facility.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.980
Yes.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.380
And hopefully it's going to go on and be an even better facility in the future.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.660
I think it's got such possibilities.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.480
It's such a brilliant area and it's such a large area.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.340
Yes.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.500
That we could do all sorts of things there.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.000
I've still got lots of ideas of things that could be done but...

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.640
But we've met a lot of people.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.060
We've had a lot of important people that have come up and looked at the area.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.000
Yes.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.740
Yes.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:06.040
And have all said, you know, what a wonderful area it is and what a wonderful thing that we should do...

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.760
that we were doing to actually try and save it for the community.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.980
Because there's the industrial kilns there.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:14.760
Archaeology and...

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:29.560
There's the general wildlife anyway and there's the nearness for the community.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.400
Yes.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:40.520
And even if they don't walk the mile and a half to get there, so we need car parking space there possibly.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.740
Yes.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.720
But they're still...

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.400
They don't know how many miles they walk once they're in.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.100
Absolutely.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.620
Absolutely, yes.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.140
Yes.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.620
And it's the...

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.460
You know, it's a place of entertainment.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.120
It's a place of learning.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.900
Yes.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.960
It's a place of education.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.000
It's a place of leisure.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.860
Yes.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.240
People just go there leisurely.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.680
They walk their dogs.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.700
They do all sorts of things within it.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.320
And I think that we've...

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:21.800
We've managed to do something really worthwhile in ensuring that it's going to be kept in, hopefully, for many, many years to come.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.240
Yes.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.040
It will be used by the community.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.260
Yes, with local open access for everyone.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.220
Yes.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.340
I do meet people now when I'm up there.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.220
I do find that some of them now...

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.240
We do have Welsh-speaking people going up there quite often.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.720
Going back years ago...

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.460
Most of the people that were up there were Welsh speakers.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.180
Yes.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.120
Most of the quarry workers would have been speaking Welsh, singing Welsh on their way back.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.120
They would be...

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:58.980
Yeah, but now, for a long time, it's been a lot of English-speaking people, and now it seems to be going full circle.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.680
It's turning back.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.320
And we seem to be having a lot of Welsh people up there and, you know, taking more notice.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.800
We do have lots of foreign people coming as well.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.000
Yes, we do.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.800
Yes.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.880
And, yeah, so I don't know if I can extend that one more way.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.180
So thank you very much, Shirley.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.080
You're very welcome.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.240
Very enjoyable to talk to you today and for you to come and meet us both.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.360
Oh, I've enjoyed it.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.820
Thank you.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.980
Thank you.
