00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
Audio point two.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.740
From here you are able to sit and enjoy the view from the bench.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:16.160
Straight ahead and slightly to the right, perched on top of a smaller hill, is the hillfort of Moel y Gair, Llanbeder.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:25.280
Samantha Williams is the hillfort conservation officer for the Heatherner Hillforts project and is involved in the work on Moel y Gair.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.440
She talks about what it may have been used for.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.700
From here you can see Moel y Gair, Llanbeder.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.580
Hillforts possibly have many functions.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.040
They are defended enclosures, so they are something that is defensive.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.080
They have massive banks and ditches, which are called ramparts, and they would have had a wooden fence on top called a palisade.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:55.900
So that does suggest that their aim was to keep people out, so possibly places that they retreated to in times of trouble and conflict.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.420
But it could also be that they were...

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.300
They were sort of farming centres on top of the hill, a bit like a Havod site in the medieval times.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.980
So you turn your flocks out onto the hill during the summer.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:18.260
So they could be centres where those people collected their flocks when they needed to sort of do shearing or something.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:27.920
And today our greatest predator is a fox, but in those days they had things like brown bears and wolves.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.920
And we forget that they were massive creatures, so it could be to protect your stock from those animals as well.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.980
And also, hillforts are on top of great massive hills, and they are really obvious features within the landscape.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.080
So they could be centres that people could gather to, to maybe celebrate births, deaths and marriages.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.820
Or for trading centres, where they could trade goods with other Celtic settlements around in the area.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.020
So they could have many, many functions.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.320
We just don't know.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.500
Next, hear about the Bronze Age from Fiona Gill, Denbighshire County archaeologist.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.780
As you're sitting on the bench, looking out towards the Vale of Clwyd and admiring the view,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.020
just look slightly to your right and you'll see this heap of stones.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.560
Higgledy-piggledy heat doesn't look as if it's got much shape to it, but actually that's the remains of a Bronze Age cairn.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.420
Presumably, originally, it either had more stone there or...

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.040
was covered up with turf and earth, and somehow that's become eroded.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.100
Possibly in the middle of there we've got a burial from 2000 BC, 4,000 years ago.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.440
Maybe even some later cremations added into the mound.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.980
Difficult to imagine now from that heap of stones, but we've got to picture maybe a group of people coming up to bury their mother, father or whatever.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.980
And feeling much as we would at a funeral too.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.420
So we've got to try and put ourselves in the right place.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.420


00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.520
And put ourselves back in the shoes, if they wore shoes, of people in the Bronze Age.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.360
When you're ready, follow the path onwards until you reach audio point 3 on a wooden way marker opposite another bench.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.840
On your way, you will catch your first glimpse of the Jubilee Tower in the distance.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.860
For additional information on hillforts from Samantha Williams, continue listening, otherwise hang up now.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.400
The features of the hillfort are that you can see the stone, the stone is a bit of a stone.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.400


00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.240
The features of the hillfort are that they have ramparts, which are big banks and ditches.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.700
Some hillforts even have more than one.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:44.160
They also have interned entrances, so the banks turn into the entrance, which would have been protected by a massive gate.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.080
So that made them quite a defensive structure again.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.440
On top of the ramparts, we would have had a Keniltsen Palisade, which is a big wooden fence.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.380
And there would have been round houses within the walls.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:08.640
The roundhouse is a circular structure that's made of timber, which would have had a thatched roof, which would have gone pretty much to the floor to keep the walls dry.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.240
The walls would have been made up of wattle and daub, which is hazel or willow that's weaved through stakes.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.760
And then covered in daub, which is a mixture of clay, animal dung and straw.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:28.160
And inside the roundhouse, there would have been a central hearth, so a fireplace in the middle to keep everybody warm.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:37.120
And that fire would have gone up into the thatch, and that would have killed any bugs that was in the thatched roof and kept it nice and snug and warm inside.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.960
And they could have also had meats and things hanging from the ceiling, so it would have smoked the meat and kept it for the winter months.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:56.540
So it would have been a nice cosy structure inside the hillfort, nestled in, and could have been used possibly in times of retreat if the hillfort was a defensive structure.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.380
Or maybe, what I'm saying is, it would have been a very, very safe structure.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.360
During the summer months, they might have lived up there in the summer months.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:10.260
The roundhouse comes in different sizes, so there might have even been different functions for roundhouses, maybe somewhere like your garden shed is today.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.220
There is evidence for grain stores as well.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:24.140
At Morla Gaea Resezmore, which is just off the Clwydion Range, outside our project area, they did a big excavation there and they found four post holes and a square in the ground.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.860
And it's believed that these are grain stores.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.260
A squared structure raised off the ground.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.020
They would have put grain in to keep it and store it over the winter months as well.
