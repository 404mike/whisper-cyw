Interview number three, interviewer Steve Fletcher, Artistic Director of Swiffer Carnival,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.500
interviewee Rob Davie. Rob could you spell your name for us please? Yes Rob is R-O-B and Davie is

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:21.560
D-A-V-E-Y. Thank you very much. So please can you tell us how did you first get involved with the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.560
Cardiff Mask Carnival? Yes I remember it well actually. In 1992 my wife Alva got herself

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.760
involved in the carnival which I think was held at Fitzallen that year and my recollection of that

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.400
year is that I was working most of the time but came down on odd occasions during the evening to

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:49.460
have a look and see exactly what my wife had got herself and our children involved in and thought

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:56.660
it probably wasn't really for me. It seemed to be a lot of sewing and chatting and a huge amount of

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.940
material going on there.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.320
And it didn't seem to be something that I really wanted to get myself involved in. However I certainly

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.660
watched that carnival and then the next year I decided that if I had any chance of actually seeing

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.260
my wife and children for three weeks that summer and probably the forthcoming summers I probably

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:23.440
had to get involved myself and that's really what I did. And I think that year I messed about with

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.240
the whole idea of having a look at the carnival and then the following year which is 1994, the blues

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.060
year as I recall, there was a lot of blue paint going around which left an indelible stain on our

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.660
bath, at least for many many weeks. I did actually get myself into a costume, something that I would

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:54.340
never have thought I would ever have done. And we never looked back for the next sort of eight,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.540
nine years I think. Got myself into costume every year. I got myself into a costume every year and

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.600
I messed about, sang a lot of songs, chanted a lot of chants and generally had a good time.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.060
Is there one costume in particular that's a standout costume for you out of the many that you

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.000
played over the years? Yeah I think so. I think it's pretty obvious. I think it generally agreed

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.340
amongst the family is probably the Player of Games which was, I don't know when that was,

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.800
mid to late 90s probably. I don't know whose idea it was but I know my wife made the costume

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:38.380
and I remember standing on the steps of the museum wearing this darn costume and it was a pretty

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.380
pretty smart costume actually. I enjoyed wearing that one. Yeah. In terms of the value of Carnival

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.520
and its impact, if you had to describe some of the benefits that you perhaps you've seen personally

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.360
or amongst your family or as a long time, you know, 10 years of Carnival involvement you'll have seen a lot.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.100
Yeah. How does it affect people? Well I think from this perspective which is some time after,

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.100
we've not done it for a number of years now because we moved away from Cardiff so we've not

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:16.920
been able to really. I think it's fair to say that it's definitely changed and enhanced our lives

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.480
but I think more than that I think it's actually informed our kids lives because they started doing

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.060
Carnival when they were quite young, I don't know about 9 and 11, something like that. And I don't

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.080
that as far as they're concerned their lives have been changed because of it for instance my son guy

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:43.560
went into theater where he remains and I think that was certainly helped by being involved in

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.480
mass and I'm Tasha my daughter went to Africa went to Senegal and married a Senegalese man

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:59.240
and I think the fact that we lived on the face of it a suburban middle-class life in Cardiff would

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.980
have meant it would been quite difficult for us to have been involved in it with in and with sort

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:13.100
of people that that mass brought us into contact with and whilst I think we had the values of

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.500
multiculturalism and integration with with other groups of people I think it would have been

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.200
difficult to realize without the mass and I think that's what the

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:20.460
the mass would have been able to do and I think that's what the mass would have been able to do

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:25.360
and I think that's what the mass has done for us and has done for many people it's brought people

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.740
together who otherwise wouldn't have come together I think that's that's its Essence really and you

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.160
mentioned chanting earlier uh do you recall any of the charts would you care to share one with us for

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:44.000
posterity ah well yes um I do recall the chance I remember um my kids getting very involved with the

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.920
workshops and actually Tasha who was quite a small girl then um she was probably only about 10 or 11.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:58.540
leading some of the chants um and you know we we I think we all recorded them as a family

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:04.060
um and they're certainly somewhere around I'm not sure if I can remember them well enough to actually

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:11.700
uh to actually sing now to be honest um that might come back to me no worries and obviously uh after

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.880
three weeks of workshop there's the you know the big blowout the parade itself can you go what kind

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.600
of audience reactions can you

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:28.060
recall um I remember in fact today because we we've been talking about mass today um and I was

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.220
looking at one of my diary entries um from from the early days and I actually said in my diary that

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:40.680
um I think that was the year I was drumming and I actually said didn't really see anything of the

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:47.220
mass at all um didn't really know what was going on I was so involved with the drumming and because

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.900
drumming certainly wasn't my forte

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.420
I was I think I was doing a lot of counting um during the mass itself so certainly that one

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:02.480
um I I didn't really see much of at all gradually as I got more used to the mass I think I think you

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:09.680
tend to look up and look around and and I just remember huge crowds lining the streets um and

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:19.340
um I I do remember wishing that the crowd would actually uh interact more with with the actual

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.680
mass um and I think in a way we were doing it for ourselves I think it was a wonderful

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:48.780
that they were there um uh I do remember one year with Zouvier which is the the the night before the

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:55.740
the carnival um uh cruising through the cafe quarter in cardiff um which had just then opened

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.280
it was a brand new cafe quarter and something that we hadn't really ever seen before people

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:07.680
sitting outside um on the on the pavements drinking and eating and getting a huge response

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.240
from them but during the actual mass itself i'm i i was pretty wrapped up in what we were doing

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:19.360
really to to be anything other than just vaguely aware of this huge body of people somewhere uh

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:28.600
around us yeah unless you care to give us a chance i think that was the top only two you

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.140
touched on everything i could hope for okay i don't feel obliged on the chat because natasha

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.620
really did sing a heart yeah no that's fine i'll leave that to tasha to um

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.180
switch that off that was brilliant there was a number of
