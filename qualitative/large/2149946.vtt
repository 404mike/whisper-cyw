WEBVTT

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:15.160
Good afternoon, we're here this afternoon with Mr. Brian Quinlan, one of the longest attending gardeners at Stackpole Wall Garden.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:39.740
We're interviewing him today which is the 2nd of February 2023 and this is part of the Citizen Curator project, an oral history project because people that have been working here and certainly very few for as long as Brian are able to tell us so much more about the gardens.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.700
So I'm working this afternoon with Julian Rollins, my colleague here who is the tutor.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.300
So I'm going to hand over and then we're going to have a bit of a chat.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.580
Thank you, yeah. Thanks for giving us your time Brian because it's a busy day isn't it.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.700
When were you born Brian? When were you born? What year? 1939. Is that Cora now? Yeah.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.760
So that's just as the second world war was starting. When the war was starting, yeah.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.080
Where were you living then?

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.600
As a child. Where did you live as a child? Outside Tenby, Gunferston.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.100
Gunferston near Tenby, so you were alone.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:32.240
The farm was down in the valleys. We had to go through a gate and then walk down to the farm.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.240
And your dad was the farmer? Yeah, my father was.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.380
Was that Astrich or what was the name of that farm? Can you remember the name? No, a long time ago.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.960
I'm not sure.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160
No, no. Gosh.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.880
So when you were small were you helping out around the farm then? Yeah.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.340
What did they used to have you doing?

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.720
What did your dad used to ask you to do?

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.560
I know he was on the tractor and horses, ploughing with horses.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.240
Then I went on the tractor after that.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.100
What age were you when you were driving the tractor? I don't know.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.400
Small?

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.140
Nine or ten.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.420
That was quite something to have a tractor then.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.860
Because I remember my father telling me, you know, it was mainly horses, wasn't it?

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.880
Quite a thing to have a tractor.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.720
Yeah.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.140
Can you remember what tractor it was?

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.980
A Fordson Major, a small one.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.240
Before they had the blue ones.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.840
What colour would a Fordson be then?

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.140
Blue.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.720
Blue.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.820
The big one, yeah.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.580
So you, from a very young age then, you were working outdoors, doing outdoor stuff.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.040
I was walking around with my father when he was ploughing.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.120
Yeah.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.620
And with the tractor, yeah.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.180
Can you remember the name of any of the horses?

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.720
We had two.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.540
Did you?

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.560
A brown one with a white face.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.600
And they used to use horses here at the garden, didn't they?

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.540
They did.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.980
Before we were all around. There's a photo, isn't there?

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.460
Yeah.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.940
So when did you, can you remember when you first came here then, Brian?

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.140
When you first came to Stadpole?

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.340
I think when I went to the Anchorage first, I think.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.720
Any idea what year that was?

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.780
No.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.880
So you're, how old are you now? You're 83.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.520
Three.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.080
Three, gosh, yeah.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.060
84 Monday week.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.280
Oh, really? Oh.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.680
Did that go on there then?

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.080
Yeah.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.720
84 Monday week.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.160
And so what did you do between sort of finishing at the farm?

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.860
Were you working other places or?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.380
I went to the golf refinery then.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.740
Oh, right, right.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.920
And I grew up working in the canteen.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.600
Ah.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.780
Ah, so they'll have you in the kitchen if they hear that here.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.500
Yeah.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.060
So you think, would it, it would be a good idea to have a little bit of a

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.460
little bit of a, would you have been around 50 when you started working here or older?

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.400
I'm not sure, a bit older probably.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.260
A bit older, yeah, yeah.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.820
About 20 or so years ago probably, I suppose.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.200
Yeah.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.240
That's when, yeah.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.940
Yeah.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.280
Things really got going here.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.620
Yeah.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.600
Is there anyone else here now who was here when you first came?

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.040
I can't remember, no, I don't think so.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.200
No, no.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.260
No, so you really are the one that, you know what's what then, yes, okay.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:57.000
So you said to me a little earlier that when you first came here the garden was in a bit

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.480
of a state.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.080
Oh, we've grown here.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.720
Yeah, what was it like?

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.900
What was growing in here?

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.720
A lot of nettles and brambles and trees.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:08.500
Trees?

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.920
Yeah, small trees.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.020
Yeah.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.020


00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.020


00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.020


00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.020


00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.120
Big trees like that.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.100
Wow.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.240
From the gate there, you couldn't open the gate, it was, well you opened the gate but

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.460
it was full of brambles and nettles so we had to clear it all down.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:24.160
Wow.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.260
So it was like clearing a jungle.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.940
Yeah.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.340
So that, was that the first job then, just cutting your way in?

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.940
Yeah.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.540
How would, how did you do that?

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.040
What sort of tools did you use, can you remember?

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.880
Saw, secateurs, clippers.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.640
No power tools, no strimmers back then?

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.360
I can't remember.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.900
No.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.780
Don't think so.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.700
And was there a big gang of you then or was it just three or four?

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.860
A few of us.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.160
And was Mr Bateman here then or?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.640
Yes, George Bateman.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.560
George Bateman, ah right.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.300
He was the head colonel then.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.940
Ah.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.120
And did you see many members of the public in those days?

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.380
Were there many visitors?

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.840
Yeah, I think there was a few walking around.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.380
Right.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:38.560
So once he, once the place had been cleared, was the, were there the, the area that is

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.540
now vegetable beds, was that the first bit that was cleared?

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.460
Yeah, we worked on them then.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.760
Do them over.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.820
And were there, was there a greenhouse?

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.660
Hm?

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.900
Was there a greenhouse?

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.420
Yeah, there was, but I had one year then.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:59.820
Oh right, okay.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.480
So you, do you remember that first sort of spring or whatever planting?

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:14.060
Was it, you know, quite something to fight, make enough space to do your planting?

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.720
Yeah.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.820
What do you remember about that?

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.200
Digging and, did you choose what to plant then?

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.240
Yeah.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.840
What did Mr Bateman tell you?

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.600
Was it, who was making the decisions?

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.460
Digging in the tunnels.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.380
Yeah.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.840
For the tomatoes.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.640
Mm.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.160
Yeah.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:37.460
Yeah.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.860
So that was when you got the tunnels underway, was it?

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:41.400
Yeah.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.780
Just out here or?

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.240
Yeah.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:43.680
Yeah.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.840
So you, you grew tomatoes from an early, early stage then?

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:49.320
Yeah.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.560
Ah, right.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.200
And, and what else were you, were you growing back then?

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:55.920
Hm?

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.000
What else were you growing back then?

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:00.240
Can you remember?

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.180
Tomatoes.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:01.900
Yeah.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.600
Onions, leeks, potatoes.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:07.300
Mm.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:07.440
Yeah.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.240
And what were you, was that a, a small vegetable garden?

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:17.240


00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:17.240


00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.120
And did you, did you have a, did you have a small tractor?

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:18.720
Did you have that little tractor?

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.380
Was there a little tractor back there?

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.120
Yeah, we had a small Fulton major.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.040
Right.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.180
Was it the same as the one you'd had at home?

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:28.660
No.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:29.660
No?

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.900
Small, grey one.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:32.360
Ah.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.460
But you felt sort of okay about the tractor, obviously?

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.100
Yeah, yeah.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:37.420
Yeah.

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:46.800
Yeah, yeah. And did you, how many times a week then did you come? Was it just once a week or?

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.780
I think it was, when we were clearing the garden.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:03.780
And what was your general feeling? Did you, you know, want to come back? Did you find it satisfying to work here?

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:04.320
Yeah.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:12.800
In what way then? Was it more like going back to your roots sort of thing?

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:13.080
Yeah.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.540
Did it remind you of when you were a child on a farm?

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:21.880
No.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.700
No. The tractor and stuff, there wasn't.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:25.400
Yeah.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:36.400
So with the crops you were growing then, you were growing onions, potatoes, leeks, tomatoes, where did all of that produce go to?

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:43.060
I don't know. They used to take some veg into the shop in Halford West.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:43.860
Oh, right.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:53.160
Next to the one, next to the pub I think. What was the name of that spa?

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:58.360
Oh, yeah. In Bridge Street in Halford West or?

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.760
No. In the town. Next to the King's Arms.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.340
Ah, right. There you are. Yeah.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:09.340
There was a shop there and they used to buy veg off us there.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.960
And I think you live in Halford West now, don't you?

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:13.320
Yeah.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.620
Were you living there then?

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.060
When I was your age? No.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:34.060
No. I see. Because the charity Pembrokeshire Mencap was originally started off in Halford West, so I guess that's probably the link for selling the vegetables over there, isn't it?

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:35.340
Yeah.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:35.980
I think so.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:35.980


00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:41.160
Did you know Ian or, you know Ian that comes down?

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.000
From the committee?

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.200
Yeah. Did you know him then? Was he here then?

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.980
I can't remember. I think he was.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.560
Probably did overlap, I should think. Yeah.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:51.960
Yeah.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:11:02.100
We can hear the blasting in the background. That's the military, isn't it? Down on Castle Martin, you get used to that noise, don't you?

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:02.340
Yeah.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:07.480
On the ranges. It's part of life here, isn't it? Listening to the guns going off.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.920
So you would have been coming once a week then?

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:15.720
Yeah, I think so.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.140
How did you get here?

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:18.820
On the van.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.960
On a van, yeah. Like a minivus?

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:22.440
Yeah.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.280
With other people who were coming to work?

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:25.900
Yeah.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.580
Who would be doing the driving then, back then?

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.340
George Beesman, I think.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.200
George would come and pick you up. What sort of time of day?

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.620
Half past nine in the mornings.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.080
And then you'd be here for a whole day, would you?

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:41.500
Yeah.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:42.520
Putting a day's work.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.900
You'd bring your dinner with you then, did you?

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:46.860
Yeah.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.280
Yeah, you'd bring your lunch, yeah.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.360
Yeah.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.080
Were there women in those days? Any women on the bus?

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.020
I think so.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.280
Yeah, like today, a little bit of a mix.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:57.980
Yeah.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.200
I've just seen Jane there in the greenhouse today.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:01.560
Yeah.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:02.200
Yeah.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.200
Did you take vegetables home after you'd grown them?

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:07.600
Yeah.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.680
Did you have your own plots in those days or was it more...

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:10.840
No.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.000
No, it was more general?

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:12.840
Yeah.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.580
I see.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:23.120
I was going to... You'd mentioned lunch, hadn't you? So when you had... You brought a packed lunch in with you.

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:23.900
Yeah.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.160
Where did you eat it in those days then, when the weather wasn't so good?

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.180
I really don't know.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:31.180


00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:31.180


00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.400
I think it was in the canteen in there.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.700
In the...

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.600
Where they make the tea.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:37.960
The corrugated iron shed.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:38.460
Yeah.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:38.820
Yeah.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.340
In here.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:39.880
Yeah.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.660
There's tables and chairs and an electric fire in there.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:46.980
Quite cosy.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:47.480
Yeah.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:57.800
You've seen a lot of changes, Brian. You know, a lot of change over the years.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:58.320
Yeah.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.160
How does it feel? Is that good or bad?

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.580
Could be bad.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.100
You're a good advert for it. You've kept fit, haven't you?

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:12.600
Yeah.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.000
You kept fit. Do you enjoy that, you know, that...

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:16.180
Yeah.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.400
...physical work? It's good, isn't it?

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.360
Yeah.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.340
Yeah.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.040
So what is it you're working on today, Brian?

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:31.120
Oh, we're digging the sides out. We're putting my pecs on top. It's tough.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:31.140


00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:31.140


00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:31.140


00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:31.140


00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:31.140


00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:31.140


00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:31.140


00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:31.140


00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:31.140


00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:31.140


00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:31.140


00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:31.140


00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:36.060
They tuck it in to the trench then and then fill it back in.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.100
Right. So is that...

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.260
And it'll hold the my pecs down.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.820
This is the stuff that the strawberries will go underneath?

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:43.640
Yeah.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:43.960
Yeah.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:52.200
We make holes in the... in the my pecs and plant them through like the tomatoes.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.840
So you're establishing a new strawberry bed, isn't it?

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:57.200
Yeah.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:57.540
Is that...

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.540
And is that good? Cos do strawberries...

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:01.120
Do you...

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.120


00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.120


00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.120


00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.120


00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.120


00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.120


00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.120


00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.120


00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.120


00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.120


00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.120


00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.120


00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.120


00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.120


00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:01.160
Do you...

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.340
Does it need to be sort of refreshed every...?

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.000
Yeah.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.260
Tell us a bit about that.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.080
They grow better then.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:07.720
Do they?

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.560
When they're replanted with a my pecs.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:15.960
Yeah. And my pecs is like this sort of film, like a... it helps to stop the weeds, does

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:16.020
it?

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:16.360
Yeah.

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:22.560
And тол ли это специфичные strawberry? Do you grow el santo? What strawberries do

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.360
you grow? Do you know?

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:25.980
Any kind, no.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:26.720
Any kind.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.320
There's some...

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:27.600
Any kind.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:31.040
They're quite early though, aren't they? Cos they come... I was...

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:31.120
I was thinking about...

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:31.120


00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:31.120


00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:31.240
I was thinking about...

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:31.240


00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:31.240


00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:31.240


00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:31.240


00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:31.240


00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:31.240


00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.100
And you seem to think they come quite early here.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:33.640
Yeah.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:40.520
And have people always come to pick the strawberries? Do you remember people doing pick your own

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.280
in the past?

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:41.760
Yeah.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:42.000
Yeah.

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:43.300
Hmm.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.980
I think they grows better when they're in the my pecs.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.980
Do they? Why is that?

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:55.080
Cos the birds gets at them when they're loose and some goes bad, you know?

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.720
So we get jays coming in and stealing them, don't we?

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.180
Yeah.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:00.560
Yeah.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.080
A little devil.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:01.120
Yeah.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:01.120


00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:01.620
Ok.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.040
Did you garden at home then?

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:03.040


00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:03.040


00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:03.040


00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.120
Had you gardened before coming here?

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.080
Hmm?

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:09.160
Had you gardened at home at all or in the past?

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.380
No, only when I was on a farm.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:11.800
Right, did you...

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.620
I didn't roach.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.220
Ah, right.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.580
Used to dry the tractor, then.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.960
Were you working there then at the...

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.920
Yeah, living in.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:20.820
Ah, right.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:21.500
Right.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.440
And did... they always grew some spuds, did they?

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:25.920
Hmm.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:26.400
Yeah.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.260
In the field then?

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:29.640
Yeah.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.320
and hay and straw.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.240
Oh, right.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.140
Did you enjoy working there?

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.280
You?

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.740
Well, there, on the farm.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:42.060
Yeah, it was all right.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.120
Yeah, it was all right.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.860
So you came here with a lot of experience.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.000
You knew what was what sort of thing

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.380
in terms of the tractors and gardening and what have you.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:54.660
Yeah.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.820
Do you think that coming here

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:02.080
and doing the sort of work you're doing keeps you fit?

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:03.420
Yeah.

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:06.840
Do you ever...

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.340
If you ever see the doctor, does he tell you you're fit,

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.460
you're doing well?

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.640
I saw two not long ago.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.260
Lady doctors, she was going to test my legs,

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.400
but she said there's no need because I was fit.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.320
Oh, well done.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.500
She checked my toes and said they're fit.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.740
That's in case you get diabetes, isn't it?

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.600
I think, because I've got...

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.440
She said you get a small stand and put your feet up

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:35.740
rather than down because it helps your veins in

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.040
when your feet are up.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.260
Aye, but she thought you were pretty good.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.320
Well, it's bound to be.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.480
You're moving a lot during the day

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.700
and I would imagine that helps then, yeah.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:47.500
Yeah.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.760
What's your favourite job here then, Brian?

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.460
What do you...

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:51.760
Europe.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:52.160
Yeah.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.380
You know, anything.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.700
Raking, digging, planting.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.420
And is this a good time of year now?

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:08.980
Yeah.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.700
I always think of you planting spuds.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.960
Well, not yet, but when will that be?

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:15.820
A month's time?

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.160
It's just the beginning of February now.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:19.860
Is it March?

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.920
Depends on the weather, doesn't it?

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:22.100
Yeah.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.440
March 8th.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:23.640
April.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.200
Hmm.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:25.500
May.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.580
Do you do first earlies?

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.600
Yeah, we have done.

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:32.140
Hmm.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.840
They're quite popular with people, aren't they?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.160
People quite like to come and buy the first new potatoes.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.100
Yeah.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.580
You must have grown many pounds of spuds over the years.

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:49.000
Yeah.

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:49.940
Haven't you?

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:51.780
What's your...

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.480
What would you say your favourite time of year is?

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.420
What would you say your favourite time of year was then?

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:55.560
Pardon?

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.220
What would you say your favourite time of the year here is then?

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:03.200
Planting.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:03.960
Is it?

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:04.500
Mmm.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:05.440
In the spring?

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:07.580
May.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:09.960
April or May.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:10.840
Mmm.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:11.640
March.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:13.900
Mmm.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.580
It's a nice pace of life.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:19.920
Yeah.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.460
You can't force nature.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:22.360
No.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:26.800
No.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:26.800


00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:27.620
No.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.340
And you can't do anything about yourself.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:31.340


00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:31.340


00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:31.340


00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:31.340


00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:31.340


00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:31.340


00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:31.660
Or you can't.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.020
You can't.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:32.020


00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:32.020


00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:32.020


00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:32.020


00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:32.020


00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:32.020


00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:32.020


00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:32.020


00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:32.020


00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:32.020


00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:32.800
Yeah.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.020
Yeah.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:36.940
So what about the next year?

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:45.820
I think we'll have our own vegetable plots.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:46.640
Yeah.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.180
Yeah.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:47.960
Vegetable plots.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:48.240
Yeah.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.340
Well, probably potatoes.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.720
Anything else?

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:05.720
Beetroot, probably.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.740
So you get some produce from that.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.220
Yeah.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:16.660
What do you usually do with what you grow then?

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.640
Where does it go to?

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.820
It takes it home then.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.380
And do you cook it yourself?

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.460
Stuff.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.000
And then we eat it then.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.920
Support workers will cook it for you?

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:29.220
Yeah.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:30.720
Do you share it with the people

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.820
that you're living with then?

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.100
Yeah.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:34.780
That's good.

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:35.780
What do they think?

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.620
Do they say good things about it?

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.080
Nice, yeah.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.300
Do you think a potato that you grow yourself

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.700
tastes better than one you buy in a shop?

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:48.940
Yeah, sometimes.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.540
Do you find it varies from year to year

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:55.780
depending on the weather?

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:56.640
Yeah.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.260
Have you ever had blight in spuds down here?

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:00.880
Yeah, a bit.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:01.540
Yeah.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.000
That's a hell of a thing, isn't it?

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:04.540
Yeah.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.880
It flattens them, doesn't it?

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:07.840
Yeah.

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:12.700
And what's the worst pests you get down here then?

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.400
Do you get a lot of slugs or snails or what's the worst?

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:17.260
Sometimes.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.080
Yeah.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.320
Yeah.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.600
So what was last year like?

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.120
Because it was a very hot summer, wasn't it, last year?

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:25.460
Yeah.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.720
Did the produce, did you manage

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.300
to grow potatoes last year?

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.440
Yeah, they looked all right, yeah.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.840
Any particular brand?

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.460
Maris Piper or?

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:38.280
Yeah.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:38.620
Yeah.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:40.920
Rocket?

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.080
Yeah.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.880
A few of the different types, is there?

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:45.780
Yeah.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.620
Oh, good.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.480
And would you, do you wish you still were going around with a horse?

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:52.320
Pardon?

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.760
Do you wish you were still ploughing with a horse?

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:55.920
No.

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:56.620
No.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.660
They walked a long way in those days.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:00.320
Yeah.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.560
So what's happening at the moment then out there?

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.540
Anything changing at the moment?

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:10.680
Pardon?

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.840
Is there anything changing at the moment?

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.680
There seem to be new beds appearing in different places.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:16.160
Yeah.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:17.740
What's going on?

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:21.420
Grapevine.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:22.600
Oh, yes.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.320
Getting ready for the grapevines.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:25.160
Yeah.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.800
What do you think of that?

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.260
It should be good.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.940
It's different, isn't it?

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.000
Interesting, isn't it?

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:34.960
Yeah.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:35.040
It'll be different.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:36.620
Yeah.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:43.860
It'll be good the day we can all sit down and enjoy a glass of walled garden wine, won't

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:43.920
it?

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.440
That'd be all right.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:45.800
Yeah.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.000
That'd be the day.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:48.480
Yeah.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:49.640
Yeah.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:51.860
Wow.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:55.220
You're pretty keen to get back to your strawberry bed, I understand.

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:57.700
Well, it's sunny.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:58.380
Yeah.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:04.920
So shall we stop it there and then we'll maybe come back to you in the future with a few

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.360
definite questions?

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:06.980
Yeah.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:07.380
Yeah.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:12.560
Maybe when some of the things that you're just planting now, we could talk to you about

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:12.900
them.

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:13.620
Yeah.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:17.800
Well, you know, when you start planting it later in the summer and ask you a bit about

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.180
those.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:19.840
Thank you, Brian.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:20.540
Thank you, Brian.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:21.380
Bye.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:21.720
Bye.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:21.720


00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:21.720


00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:21.720


00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:21.720


00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:21.720


00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:21.720


00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:21.720
