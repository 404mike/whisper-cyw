00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360
Do you think that television has had an effect on your use of leisure time over the years?

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.300
Oh yes, definitely. Without a doubt. Yes.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.500
We do say we select the viewers, because quite often we don't want the television on until 9 o'clock.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.520
But television does play a very important part in our lives. There's no doubt about it.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.540
I think it plays an important part in everybody's lives.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.640
I think anybody who says it doesn't are kidding themselves.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.080
Because Wendy knows I'm an avid news watcher. I must have this 6 o'clock or 10 o'clock news on.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.840
And when I knock it off, I'm depressed.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.120
And of all the things that you've seen over the years, what has left the greatest impression on you?

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.880
Oh, it's got to be Mandela.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.460
We had the pleasure last year of going to the British Lions.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.760
And we went up to Robben Island.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.700
The moment we arrived there, we started crying.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.600
And didn't stop crying until we got off.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.940
Until we got back on the boat.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.080
And I wasn't far behind.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.580
But that day when he walked free.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.440
Oh, dear me.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.500
That will be everlasting.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.360
And it's cemented now, because we've been there.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.040
And we actually went to the cell where he spent all his years.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.280
We've had the background of all that he did.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.220
The background of all that he stood for.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.600
All the things he refused.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.180
They couldn't break him.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.520
And when we found out that they offered him this, that and the other.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.040
He said, no, no, no.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.320
Offer it to us all.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.780
I love it.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.580
I think the character of the man, the principle of the man.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.180
And because we've been there as well, it's just there now.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.600
And whenever we see that walk now.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.600
Oh, boy, oh boy.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.380
It gets better and better.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.780
But there's another as well.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.580
I think I had an impact.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.980
A similar thing.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.400
Great man.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.460
Uh, Jeff Kaye.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.380
You know, the time you go shop, we all know where we were.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.340
I certainly knew where I was.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.100
And that.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.280
As a teenager.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.840
Had a very big effect and I couldn't couldn't get enough of watching it.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.740
Could I never, ever subscribe to the theory of the assassination?

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.300
You know, and we never know the truth.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.160
I'd love to, but we never will.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.540
But that again, the mystery surrounding it as well as added to it.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.840
But the assassination of Kennedy as a teenager.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.740
Oh, dear me.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.140
Huge impact.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.820
Huge impact.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.820
He's our hero.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.720
You know, a young man taking charge of the world.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.520
Assassinated.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.160
And then all the plots and counter plots that came after it kept the news going for years and years.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.840
And then theories come out.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.940
So we've never lost it.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.020
Never lost it.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.320
But and two great men.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.760
I think Mandela more than anything else, because we've our friend actually met him.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.300
And he's got a photograph of his wall with Mandela.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.900
So and the greatness of the man himself.
