00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.060
What is your full name?

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.220
Helen Lewis John.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.060
Do we have permission to record this interview?

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.900
Yes.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.920
Where and when were you born?

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.260
Swansea in 1932.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.500
How did you meet Father Paul Satori?

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:34.600
I received a letter in 1979 from a friend of my Aunt Nell's.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.520
I took it to work because I didn't have time to open it.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.520
When I read the letter I was shocked and upset, as Frances was,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.400
because she assumed that I had known about my Auntie Nell

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.140
dying and being buried.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.200
The fact that Auntie Nell was a very staunch Catholic

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.560
and the fact that she had just been buried without the Eucharist,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.720
the Requiem Mass, that upset us very much, both of us.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.440
So the person I spoke with at work was a Catholic

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.380
and attended the church in Haverford.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.380


00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.280
So she took me down in our break to see Father Satori.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:36.700
So I showed him the letter and I did explain to him that I was now a lapsed Catholic.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.020
There was no sense, he wasn't judgmental at all, he didn't criticise or anything.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.220
He was very, very sympathetic, very, very kind.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.380
And he was very kind.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.720
And he said, I'll do my best to find out what happened

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.240
and I'll speak with you in a few days' time.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.200
Which he did.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.280
He actually rang his brother in Swansea, who was also a priest,

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.700
and he got the information from him.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:18.000
And then when he rang me again, he said that because I was no longer a Catholic,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.420
he wasn't allowed to give me a service in the church.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.860
But he arranged for me to go to the little convent in Haverford West.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.300
And the Mother Superior there conducted the service.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.140
And it was lovely.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.540
It, you know, it, what did it do?

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.520
It made me, gave me the courage to say goodbye to my Auntie Nell,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.700
who I loved dearly.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.400


00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.020
So was that your earliest memory of Father Paul Satori?

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.880
Yes.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.500
Did you ever meet him afterwards?

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.800
No, unfortunately.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.320
How would you describe him as a person?

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.580
I know you've only met him once, but what did he come across as?

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.660
He came across as a very kind, outgoing person.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.480
And I would think, I don't know,

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.700
that he would have had a lovely sense of humour.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.880
Can you think of, do you have any other stories of Father Satori,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.480
or did you have any other connection with him?

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.740
Was it just that one incident?

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.260
That was just that one incident.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.380
But when he, the hospice was founded,

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.760
I made, I make a donation.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.540
I've got a direct debit,

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.720
and I make a monthly donation to the foundation.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.020
I feel that's, that's all I can do to say thank you to him.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.620
That's marvellous.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.040
Yeah.
