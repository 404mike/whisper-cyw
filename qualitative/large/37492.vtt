00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040
I attended a school of their own primary school,

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.340
which was the Welsh medium primary school in Carmarthen.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.640
It was the only, and still is, the only Welsh medium school in the town.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.940
It hadn't struck me until I reached secondary school how large the school was.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.060
It had 300 or so children, so it was quite a large school.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.440
But at the time, I hadn't realised its size.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.760
Within the classroom, we had a blackboard.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.040
Certain classrooms had a revolving blackboard,

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.500
which was posh in comparison with one blackboard on the wall.
