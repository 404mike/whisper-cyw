00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.060
But I love it. Being here 56 years now.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.740
56. Same as me.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.820
Same as us. I love it.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.160
I wouldn't move from here though.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.520
Oh no. I wouldn't.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.360
I love Bates.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.860
And when I hear people saying about Bates.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.740
Oh I go back.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.540
I get annoyed.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.200
Well it's better than Dufferin.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.560
Everyone got their batting good.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.540
You shouldn't do that.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.460
You shouldn't run anything down.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.520
In the spa on Malpas Road.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.700
There was people at work there.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.320
That came from Bates.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.200
And if you heard them.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.140
You'd never think they came from Bates.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.520
No.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.380
Oh everything is bad about Bates.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.320
I know.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.080
I say hang on a minute.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.960
Stand on the lane and watch the children.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.380
The majority of them go at Malpas.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.340
That's what I say.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.540
So don't come here saying about Bates.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.360
I won't have it.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.060
They got batting good everywhere.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.940
The touch parts.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.560
The posh parts.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.660
You shouldn't do that.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.520
You've got your good and your bad everywhere.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.540
I don't care what you say.
