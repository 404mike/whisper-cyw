00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
I suppose I watched, I think when I was in the sixth form,

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.760
we did watch television in the evening a little bit more

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.040
because I didn't have the, I didn't do the amount of subjects then.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.860
Things eased off in the sixth form.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.040
But my viewing pattern, I think, well, see, I've moved about a bit.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.620
Now, when I went to college, we did have a television in the common room,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.440
but we didn't watch much television there.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.640
I don't remember much about television in college.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.740
And then when I went to work in Liverpool, we did hire a television set,

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.540
you know, on, what do you call it, what do you call it, on hire purchase.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.240
DER it was.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.140
And, do you know, there were four of us in the first year working there.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.200
And this girl, no, when we went to the shop,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.420
the manager said,

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.940
the man said to us, you know, we asked him about that.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.440
And then when he realised we wanted to have a television,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.440
he wouldn't sell it, he wouldn't let us have it.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.220
And I said, why?

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.160
He said, you're too young.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.340
I said, we're teachers.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.460
And he didn't believe me.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.080
They wouldn't sell us.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.520
And, do you know, I also had somebody who wouldn't sell me the news of the world either.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.460
They said, you're too young.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.720
This woman had, the papers weren't on the counter, they were at the back.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.400
And this old woman, she was a teacher.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.860
And this old lady wouldn't let me have the news of the world.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.540
We must have looked young.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.440
We must have done.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.100
Oh, dear me.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.600
I wish that happened now.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.020
Anyway, the thing was,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.960
so yes, we had this,

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.080
eventually we did have a television from another shop, DER it was.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.780
But I don't know that we watched a lot of television.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.080
I don't recall watching programmes much on it,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.760
except the news maybe.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.980
I remember on one occasion, there was something about the pill,

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.940
which was quite controversial at the time.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.740
I don't remember watching anything much.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.440
I can't remember the programme, or Coronation Street,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.680
because my friend was, oh, she's been faithfully watching Coronation Street for years.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.540
And so we did watch that.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.300
But, I suppose we went out more in those days.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.140
When you're younger, you go out more, don't you?

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.280
And I was very much in with a Welsh group in Liverpool then.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.240
And then I went to London, and we had,

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.000
we didn't have a television there.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.000
But I was only there a term anyway.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.000
And then I came back to the Wirral,

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.700
and yes, I did have a television, but not immediately.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.620
I did go out more in the beginning.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.760
But then I had my own flat, and I had a television there,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.380
which was black and white.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.700
Most people had black and white then.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.260
And I think I watched Coronation Street.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.000
I've always liked Coronation Street.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.500
Don't watch any other soap.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.920
And the news as well.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.740
So I've always been clued up to the news, really.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.820
And I used to watch the Gulf,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.640
and a horror film on a Monday night.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.620
Not that I like horror films now.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.080
And sports. I love sports.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.180
I like watching.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.700
Rugby.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.520
I like watching Formula One.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.500
And tennis.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.500
I watched tennis there, and we used to discuss the games at school as well.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.660
Because in those days, Wimbledon started about two o'clock, was it?

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.920
Or, yes.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.140
So we finished work at three o'clock.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.040
So we'd be rushing home at that time,

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.020
because things were easing off then with summer term.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.980
It was nearly holiday time, wasn't it?

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.600
And so to watch the matches.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.380
It was at the time when Chris Everett was in.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.440
And he was in a heyday, and people like that.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.640
And...

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.540
Wait a minute.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.420
Yes, I remember watching those.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.120
I think, I suppose, really, I watched more television when I had my own flat.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.040
I know at home, my father used to like wrestling on a Saturday afternoon,

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.960
which I didn't.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.560
So I didn't watch that.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.280
Yeah, I think, I suppose, I was more aware of television.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.680
In the 60s, 70s.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.840
And I've always been a selective viewer.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.540
But I do like certain things, you know.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.260
And I like, I love historical drama, you know.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.180
Like the, oh, and things like Silk.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.560
And another one I loved.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.640
Well, this was, I was still at school then.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.540
They used to have a program called No Hiding Place.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.120
It was a detective thing.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.020
But it was lovely, a lovely program.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.800
On a Sunday night, I think it was.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.520
I think it was a Sunday night.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.420
And they had quite nice music to introduce it as well.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.640
Yeah.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.680
And then in later years, I watched Van der Valk.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.840
Do you remember that?

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.520
I'm probably talking about things you don't know about.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.500
Van der Valk.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.680
That was another television program based in Holland.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.940
And that was very iconic music.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.060
Have you ever heard of that?

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.680
Yes, that's it.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.540
And, oh.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.700
Yes, there's been some, I love documentaries if they're, you know, if they interest me.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.340
And of course in later, well, I'm sorry now that Learning Zone is on in the middle of the night.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.060
Although I'm late, you know, I'm late up.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.900
But it's just too late.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.020
It's four o'clock or something.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.360
But they used to be, it used to be on about midnight.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.160
At one time.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.020
And I used to love watching some of that because it's quite educational.
