00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.900
At home we had no television in 1953, but I had an uncle who lived in Trialo which did.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.100
So I can remember that we went to Trialo on the day of the coronation to actually try and view it.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.480
Because again, the quality of picture wasn't very clever.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.820
It was all in black and white, very crackled.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.460
So I can vaguely remember that.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.380
And remember it because people's opinion were quite different in those days.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.000
And I suppose that a lot of the family were ex-service people.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.420
So at the age of four I could sing the sort of national anthem.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.280
Especially for that particular day I suppose.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.300
So yeah, I do remember the coronation.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.080
What was the atmosphere like? Do you remember anything of that?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.200
In addition to being able to see it on television, of course there were street parties.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.420
There were street parties and there was lots of decorations.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.640
And different streets did different things.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.480
I remember on the sea road where I lived, of course we couldn't decorate the main road.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.960
But one of the side streets, Whitting Street in particular, was highly decorated.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.460
And they put on this magnificent play of theirs.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.540
And they used the Catholic Church Hall in the sea to do it.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.340
And it was funny to see people of all ages taking part.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.320
Everybody got involved.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.360
A really truly sort of local community spirit in those days.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.220
Truly different to what it is nowadays.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.220
Thanks for watching.
