Has television influenced your leisure time over the years?

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.500
How is it? Not a great deal, no,

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.600
because, you know, we came from a family that really,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.960
as I think I pointed out to you, when you first phoned,

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.140
you know, television was not the main thing,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.000
as you see when we're going to some friend's house,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.700
a great big thing stuck on the wall.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.020
But ours was always discreetly put in the corner.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.420
And it had a very nice veneered cabinet, didn't it,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.400
worn with doors.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.580
And for some reason, everyone used to cover them with cloths in those days.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.240
Why was that?

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.300
What?

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.440
My friend Mum was telling me yesterday, when I was saying you were coming,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.940
her mum always used to put a big cloth over the television at night,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.920
and my mother too, whether they felt that it would keep the picture clearer

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.980
or whether to keep the rays away.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.900
And at one time, we were told not to sit within three or four metres of televisions,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.360
weren't we?

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.220
But I don't know if that wore them.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.800
It still exists.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.840
We never hear of it now, do we?

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.200
Usually the engineers used to advise where to put it and where the seats were when we had one.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.620
But no one's mentioned that lately, have they?
