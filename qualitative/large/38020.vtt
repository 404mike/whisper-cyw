00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.060
just above Mansfield,

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.560
and there were huge coal tips.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.420
So it was a wonderful area to play in, you know.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.880
We'd play all sorts of cowboys,

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.620
Indians hide and seek and all that,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.240
in those sort of areas.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.260
But we'd also have a tin sheet

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.020
and slide down these tips, you know.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.720
That was another thing I really remember now.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.920
Yeah, certainly the cinema had some effect on us,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.200
but I mean, we didn't think we could be superman.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.700
Oh my goodness.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.320
Certainly cowboys and Indians were a big part of being...

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.340
or a junior school child, anyway, yeah.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.820
Now we're in the 50s, obviously, yeah.
