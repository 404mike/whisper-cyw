WEBVTT

00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.780
And I'm just going to say at the top of the tape that I'm Marsha Marnie and I'm

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.620
with Margaret Prosser and I can't see the name of your farm. What's the name of

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.740
the farm? Cronin's. C-R-O-N-I-N-G. Cronin's Farm and it's Rudry.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.020
Rudry? Yes. And it is... Neocophilly. Neocophilly. I thought we were in Neocophilly.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:25.680
And it is Friday September the 6th 2019. So I'm just going to pop that down there.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.360
When we were coming over the hill I could see... I thought are we in Neocophilly? I couldn't

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.960
believe it. I didn't think we were that close. Yeah. You came up this road here. Yeah.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.000
And you actually took that... So you're looking across there. It's a different perspective

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.460
because it's gorgeous looking across the levels there isn't it? Yes. Yes it is. Yes. Yes.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.840
Yes. And then when you get on the top there you can see Clevedon... Pier. Pier. Really?

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.520
That's amazing. I might have to come back when it's a clearer day. Yes that's right.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.660
Yes. Yes. It's not a clear day.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.840
No. I suppose we've had a rain this morning and that makes it more... limited more aren't

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.420

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.640

She was born there on... on the moors. She was there. Yeah. She was born there when I

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:37.760
was born. Would you know Steph Davis? Um. Oh what's her maiden name? I can't think of

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:45.760
her maiden name now. She was born at Lower Newton House I think. Stephanie. Stephanie.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.440
Um. I can't think of her name now. I'll... I'll think of it. Um. But I wonder if we can

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.620
just start off. If you could just tell us. Yeah. What's her maiden name? I don't know.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:02.520
Um. When you were born and where you were born. And I was born at 31 Herbert Avenue,

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:11.480
Riske. Um. As I say my mother was a farmer's daughter and my father was doing works you

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.740
know. And um we moved from there then to Park Place at Riske and we lived there for quite

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.200
a few years. And then we moved from there then and took the farm at Langorse. And that

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.480
was uh nineteen... what was it? Nineteen... nine. Nineteen. Nineteen. Nineteen. Nineteen.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:33.340
Oh dear. Nineteen... forty-six. Forty-seven. That's right. And then I moved back down

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.900
then to Sluice in 1956 when I married Derwin. So your... so what was your father's name?

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.420
William Benjamin Thomas. And your mother? Minnie Harris. Oh that's nice. Named Minnie.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.780
Um. So your father worked in the steelworks you said? Yes. Where? Uh in Pontymyster Steelworks

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.460
which is not there at the moment. Yeah. That was um taken down some years ago. Um. And

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.860
that's where I went to work with the... with the... with the... with the... with the...

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.860


00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.460
steelworks. Um. And then I moved to Newport. Was that in Newport? Uh Riske.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:05.380
Ah. Pontymyster Riske. Yeah. Um. So he wasn't a farmer at all? No. No. No. Um. And then

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.940
he had his sister Evelyn Mary Thomas and she was forty-four years in Riske at a radio...

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.340
an electrical shop. Ah. 𝐅𝐆𝐍𝐍𝐍𝐍𝐍𝐍. And then his other sister Auntie Phyllis,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:24.360
Phyllis Thomas. She was a teacher. And um up in Abercarne. And um they lived in uh...

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.420
uh... oh I've got to think of the name of the place now. Oh dear that's terrible isn't

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.200
it? Uh they lived in um Woodland Drive in Rodgestone. I don't know whether you know

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.760
that area do you? No I don't. Do you know Riske at all? Not very well at all no. You

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.680
don't? No. No. You go up through Woodland Drive, uh Rodgestone up to Riske and then

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.620
of course you carry on up the valley then. So your... your mother was from a farming

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.920
background? Yes. Yes. And where was she from? Newhouse Farm Panteig near Pontypool. Okay.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.340
One near Wynne it was really. Um. Um. And she was a farmer. Um. And she was a farmer.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.360
Um. So how did she meet your father? Uh well I think my gran... my um grandparents on my

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.220
mother's side... father's side lived in New Inn. And I think my daddy used to go back

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.020
and forth you know to see them and that фow they met I suppose. It's funny how people

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.000
do meet don't they? Um. So your father had to learn how to be a farmer then presumably?

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.140
Yes he was always interested. His... his... his cousin used to keep the Mardie Farm, Kerkurnu

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.320
just below the Kerkurnu uh golf course. Yes. And uh... um... he was a farmer. He was a

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.320


00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.320


00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.900
farmer. He was a farmer. He was a farmer. And uh he spent a lot of time there. So that

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.520
um you know he really got fed up with the uh as the saying is in the steelworks. So

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.680
he thought they'd branch out and uh they had this farm in Langorse then. And we took that

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.480
over Lockstock and Barrow. We took over the... when they say Lockstock and Barrow we took

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.640
over the stock and uh and rented the farm there. Okay. Yes. Mm hmm. Langorse and um

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.900
I liked Langorse very much. We'd look out for the door and you could see the plenervan.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.320
Oh he had? Yes. Yeah. In 1947. Yeah. And then the... the... the... the... the... the... the...

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.520
the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the...

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.460
vised. Yeah. And then in 1927 was a winter. Oh terrible. Was it really? Oh shocking yes.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.540
I mean we had tremendous snow. Um the Tschumel didn't go from there to the... with the lorry

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.200
for over a week. Wow. Because we were snowed up. Yeah. Right to the hedges. Crikey. And

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:16.220
then there was a... a... a camp of Italians at Böch. And there was another um... um the

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:23.360
Germans in uh Italian... German soldiers in Brecon. And they cut through really. Yes.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.300
Amazing. Yes. It was. It was. It was a... it was a... it тех. It was a... it was a... it was

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.600

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.800

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.380
Brecon then from... from Laungros. And i'd walk up to the hill I used, I used to hate

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.340
school. Uh... I'd rather be home, Ha ha ha doing the work, Ha ha ha doing the work there.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.860
And um they... just er... Sy chocolat sometimes but it's walk at the time. And I used to

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.520
really good olun-out. And then I'd hear the train coming around from Talga to Brecon

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.980
and stop at the Laungros不用 and stop at the Laungros工house and... I tried to

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.580
way. But no I never got there and I came home.端, but then I thought I said look

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.760
who worked for the drainage board.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:58.560
Ah, right.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.900
Yeah, so he's a chap that goes round cleaning them

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.820
and talking to all the landowners and stuff.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.000
So John introduced me to...

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.420
He said, you've got to speak to Derek and Andrew Prosser.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:09.760
Oh.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.120
So that...

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.560
And then that's why I'm here now.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:13.040
Yes.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.500
Yeah, very grateful to him.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:14.760
Yeah.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.400
Well, my father Prosser, he was on the drainage board

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.460
and he was supposed to lend a different beatings and that, you know.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.160
So that's, um, Dillwyn's father?

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:23.480
Father.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.960
So what was his full name?

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:25.460
Winford.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.520
Winford Prosser.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.000
Mm.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.140
So what...

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.980
And his wife was living at Lansoy.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.060
And I don't know how they met.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.400
Um...

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:35.660
Er, let me see.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.400
I think...

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.540
I think Dillwyn's father had a housekeeper

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.640
and then, um, my mother-in-law Marjorie,

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.600
she was Marjorie,

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.340
she came down to meet her

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.140
and then, er, they seemed to pa...

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.520
to get friendly and then they married, you see.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:52.080
I love that.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.100
Yeah, so Lansoy.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.440
Lansoy at, er, at the side desk.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.940
So what was, um, er...

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.160
Sorry, what was his name?

00:09:59.380 --> 00:09:59.740
Winford.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:00.160
Winford.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:00.760
Winford.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.020
Yes.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.160
So he was on the drainage board, you see.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:03.720
Yes, yes.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.340
And Dillwyn was on the drainage board.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:05.740
Yeah.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.280
Yes.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:06.500
Mm.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.320
So I'm getting confused.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.780
So Winford is Dillwyn's father?

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:09.400
That's right.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:09.720
Yes.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.980
So Winford was on the drainage board.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:12.540
So what do...

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.680
What can you tell me about Dillwyn's parents?

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.760
And on the farm and...

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.100
Er, well, erm, Dillwyn's...

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.680
Dillwyn's dad, erm, Winford,

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.500
er, has got a brother,

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.480
I'm sure he photographs out there afterwards,

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:26.920
erm, Campbell Cross.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.040
So he was a barrister-in-law

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.240
and he was out in abroad for a long time, Singapore.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.240
Really?

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.800
And then he had a sister,

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.080
erm, which I've got the photo...

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.240
The whole family's over there, you can see later in.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:42.320
And, erm, then he had a sister that lived in,

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.380
erm, in...

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.160
Cardiff Road.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:50.300
Er, and then, erm, is Missy Campbell.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.120
And then there was Dillwyn who was killed in the war,

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:54.720
First World War.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.560
And, erm, that was Winford.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.560
Erm, well, I'll have to...

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.740
I can show you the photograph.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.300
I won't...

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.920
It's on the wall, so it's easy for you to...

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.260
Yeah.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.580
You know, to have a look at it on the wall, really.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:05.940
Yeah.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.640
So that was, like, that was Dillwyn's father's side,

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.540
you see, of the...

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.220
And do you know...

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.040
And they had butcher's shops in Cardiff,

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:13.640
Clifton Street.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:14.160
Yeah.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:14.520
Yes.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.540
There's a big butcher in there.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.980
And, erm, that was their business, more or less, you know.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.240
So, a...

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.300
A butchery shop.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:22.040
Yes.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:22.580
Butcher's shop.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.180
So, when did the farm come into the...

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:29.560
Well, Winford, erm, he wasn't keen on the butchery shop,

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.020
so he went farming then.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.240
So he took over...

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.660
Took sluice then, rented sluice.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:35.340
Oh, right.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.420
And then, of course, the milk.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.000
And then there was to have a milk round,

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.160
er, with a milk van and everything.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.240
And, erm, Dillwyn used to go occasionally when his father

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.980
had a meeting up in London,

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.740
but, er, he wasn't so keen on the...

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.420
on the milk round.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.740
But, er, he used to do it when his father had to go to London

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.140
for meetings with the drainage board and that, you know.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.320
So why did they have meetings in London?

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.840
I... I don't know, really.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.040
But, erm...

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.100
And, of course, they used to have the meetings out at, erm,

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.480
Magar, didn't they?

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:06.180
Yeah.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.120
That's the place... Is it Magar?

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.520
Yes, Magar, isn't it?

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:10.380
They used to have the...

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:11.220
Oh, Nash.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.080
Nash, rather. That's right, Nash.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:13.200
Oh, Pye.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:13.500
Pye Corner.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.620
That's right, Pye Corner.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.380
Yeah, yeah.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.780
Nash, Nash, yes, yeah.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.500
Yeah, so, er...

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.460
So was it... was it always a dairy farm then,

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.600
the Stute farm?

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.520
Yes, yes, yes.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.100
They had cow... we had cows and everything,

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.120
and sheep.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.540
But, erm...

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.660
And then we moved up here later,

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.820
and then, erm, they moved there,

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.240
but then they went out to the cows.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.780
And so the Andrews only got the sheep at the moment.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.700
So then you met, erm, Dillwyn.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.140
Through Young Farmers.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.180
Through Young Farmers.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.080
And so, erm, er, what...

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.060
So where did you marry, actually?

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.660
In Coedcoonoo Church.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:48.500
Oh, did you?

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.680
It's a dear little church, yes.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.520
It's a house now, it's been turned into...

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.500
Yes, Coedcoonoo...

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.580
Do you know, erm...

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.300
Do you know, erm...

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.880
Well, you know the main road I said about with this article,

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.520
so you turn down for Coedcoonoo...

00:12:59.520 --> 00:12:59.780
Yes.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:00.480
...for the golf course.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:00.800
Yes.

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.040
And it's just before you get to the golf course.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.260
Or just after the golf course, sorry.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:05.880
On the right?

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:06.860
On the left-hand side,

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.500
you've got a little lane up to the church.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:09.660
Really?

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:10.020
Mm.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.040
Oh, I don't think I've been to the church.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:12.680
Oh, I don't either.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.640
It's a house now, people, it's, erm...

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.600
Was it a chapel then?

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.280
Or was it a chapel?

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:16.840
No, a church.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:17.480
Mm.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.240
Really?

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.140
Yeah, Coedcoonoo Church.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.980
Oh, I have to go back that way afterwards.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.240
I might go and have a look.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.140
Yes, yes, yes.

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:23.820
I had no idea.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.080
And, erm, I think there's three or four houses there.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:27.480
Mm.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.520
Er, because there was a farm next to it,

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.960
but they've gone into, into homesteads, you see.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:32.620
Mm.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.160
So then, so did you then start your married life at Seuss Farm?

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:37.220
Yes, yes.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.260
You moved in with...

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:38.420
I moved...

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.300
...with your in-laws?

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.540
No, no, they moved, they built a house.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.180
Do you see the house on the side there?

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:43.460
Yes.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.280
They built that.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:44.800
Oh.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.780
And then we went into the farmhouse,

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.320
and they built, they built that and went into there.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.420
So this would have been, what, the mid-50s?

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.520
Yes, 57.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:54.700
57?

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:55.460
Yes.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.280
So, erm, so what was the farm doing then?

00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.060
Was it...

00:13:59.060 --> 00:13:59.820
Er, milk.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:00.460
Milk.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.440
Milk, and milk round.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:01.960
Yeah.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.680
Yeah, and just fill the bottles, you know,

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.040
and wash the bottles then in a, in a little shed that was there.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:07.500
Yeah.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.000
It's, erm, yes, it's, I think...

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:10.000


00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.200
I've got a photograph here.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:12.540
Excuse me.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.260
How many cows did you have, Margaret?

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:16.860
Pardon?

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.000
How many cows did you have?

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.820
Er, well, not like they've got today.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.100
They've got hundreds today, haven't they?

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:22.340
Yeah.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.500
And they've really been 125.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:24.760
That's dope.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.820
Which is quite, you know, big for those days, I suppose, isn't it?

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:28.020
Yeah.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:28.160
You know.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.840
And I've got a photograph here, I think, haven't I?

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:31.140
Yeah.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.400
And that wasn't all hand-milt, was it?

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:36.460
Pardon?

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.060
Was that all milked by hand?

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.400
Well, it was years ago,

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.220
and then they, of course, they went in with the machines then, you know.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.980
This is a photograph of Slough's house.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.560
This was before 1963.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.560
That's where it was when I used to live there, see?

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.120
Oh, crikey.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.600
There was a milk van by there.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:57.120
Yeah.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.320
A dairy there where they used to, er, russet milk bottles.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:00.720
Yeah.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.040
Cows used to go into there.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:02.560
Yeah.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.980
And then this was the garden.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.060
I mean, Anne's got a beautiful garden down there now.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:06.440
Wow.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.800
And then there was just a shed where we kept chickens.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.320
Yeah.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.540
And then there was a little shed there.

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:10.540


00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:14.020
So it all altered, of course, because all of this is buildings here now, isn't it?

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.440
This has all changed, hasn't it?

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.020
Yeah, all definitely.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.060
I mean, it's all built up.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.020
It was very rural then.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:18.560
Yes.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:18.640


00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:19.620
Yes, yes, it was.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:20.340
Crikey.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:25.640
And then in this field here, which Father Prosserow was in-wound, that's where they

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.320
built the house you can see Wyvern.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:28.020
Oh.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.580
You know, they built that there.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.220
Did they build that because Dilwyn was getting married?

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:33.820
Yes.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:34.420
Yes.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.880
They built that to go in there.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.540
And, erm, oh, I'm sorry.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.380
I was only thinking about the house.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:39.380


00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:39.380


00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.900
I was thinking about how much it cost the other day.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:42.600
I think it was about 90...

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.600
Oh, I've forgotten the money.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.640
I'm not sure I was thinking about how much it cost the other day.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:53.180
The bridge cost nearly more to get across the ream to get to the house than the house,

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:53.460
I think.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:53.860
Really?

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.000
Yes, it was.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.600
You forget about that, don't you?

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:56.840
Yes, you do.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.040
You have to get across the ream.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:58.440
That's true.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:15:59.440
Yes, yes.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.540
So what were your first impressions when you moved down there and started married

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:03.920
life?

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.420
Well, I used to go back and forth there before we were actually married, you know,

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:09.360
and have sex, you know.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:09.360


00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:09.360


00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:09.360


00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:09.900
And, erm, I didn't have any friends there.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:15.040
And, erm, I had a couple of things with my mother-in-law and, erm, yes, well, I liked

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.400
it very much because we had ground with Berry Hill.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.420
We had two fields on the moors, as we call them.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:21.700
Okay.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:22.200
Yeah.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.980
I rented those.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:28.680
And, erm, so it wasn't any different for me, really, you know.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:29.000
Yeah.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.140
And then, of course, you used to go to Young Farmers there and we used to go to

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.460
Young Farmers Club in St. Melons.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.180
Did you?

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:34.960
Yes, yes.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.600
And the chapel there used to hold the Young Farmers meetings.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:38.440
Yeah.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.340
But, erm, I didn't get that.

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:39.340


00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:39.340


00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:39.340


00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:39.340


00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:39.340


00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:39.800
Oh, yes.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.220
I enjoyed life.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:46.880
So, as a farmer's wife, so I've spoken to lots of farmers, and, erm, so as a farmer's

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:53.200
wife, would you, would you have been aware of and concerned with all the reams and the

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.380
maintenance and stuff?

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:59.280
I mean, I guess what I'm trying to ask is, was there very much a clear, this was what

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.640
the woman did and this is what the men did, or was it all mixed up?

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:08.340
Erm, well, I think, I, I used to, I used to enjoy going out and feeding calves and

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:09.080
things and that.

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:09.500
You know?

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.140
And then when he was born, he used to be, we used to put him in the pram and put him

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:14.720
in the corner of the milk and shed.

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.500
And he'd be sat there, you know, watching the cows coming in and out and all that sort

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:18.620
of thing.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:24.320
And, er, before we had a parlour, that was the milking parlour type of thing, you know,

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.280
where you could get up and in and all that sort of thing.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:30.480
But, erm, yeah, I've always been, I've always been interested outside.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:35.840
Because I used to spend quite a bit of time before we went to Langhorst with my, my grandparents

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.860
at, erm, Newhouse Farm Panty.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.020
And I used to go out there and stay when I was a little tot, you know.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.540
Put me on the bus in Newport and my aunt would meet me in New Inn.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:47.520
How lovely!

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:48.420
Yeah, yeah.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.720
So, did you ever get involved in the bottling of milk down there?

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:56.440
I used to have sometimes, and that helped, erm, wash, my father probably used to, you

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.300
know, mostly he'd do that.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:02.960
I'd have to come back off the round and then wash the bottles and get them ready then to

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.380
fill up the next morning.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.300
You know, it's, er, yeah, oh yes.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:08.840
Oh yes, I've had a, I've had a, I've had a, I've had a, I've had a, I've had a, I've had

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.280
a, I've had a, I've had a very enjoyable life really.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.880
That's, er, you can tell that, it shows in your face.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:14.220
Oh, does it?

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:14.420
It's lovely.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.440
Yeah, it does!

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.080
What about the poultry, was that the important part of the, the fun?

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.120
Yeah, we used to sell eggs on the, on the milk farm quite a lot, you know.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:28.340
And then, if there was any surplus eggs then, er, I used to bring them to the Husband Brothers,

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:34.260
we used to have, erm, er, er, well, I don't know, what do, what do you call it, an egg,

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:38.820
erm, centre that they would have eggs and then they'd take them out on delivery.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:39.080
It was a very, very different, very different, very different, very different, very different

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:39.080


00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.020
Where were the Husband Brothers based?

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.080
Er, it's in, er, it's, it's, erm, Lisvane.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:44.820
Oh really?

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.700
Yes, yes, but that's all different now altogether.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:48.300
Mmm.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.280
You know, it's, places change, don't they?

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:50.640
Yeah!

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:55.780
Well it's interesting looking at this photograph, because you must have seen enormous change

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.340
in your lifetime down there.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:02.400
Oh yes, yeah, especially now, er, more buildings up for stock and everything, you know.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:02.840
Yeah.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:07.460
And, er, I mean, I, I was trying to keep it, well, clean side, you know, all this business.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:07.740
Yeah.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.460
And we used to have a boy living in then, you see.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.240
Did you?

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:14.740
Yes, yes, you know the, er, excuse me, you know the kitchen?

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:15.380
Mmm.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.980
You, you go in through the back door, don't you?

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.060
That's the dinar-, kitchen for every day.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:20.380
Yeah.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.760
Then there's the kitchen, isn't there?

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.020
Yeah.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.220
Then there's the other room.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:23.480
Mmm.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.260
Well, we used to have a boy living in there.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:25.800
Did you?

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:30.380
Yes, yeah, and, erm, he had his bed in there and there was a stove in the corner.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.020
We used to have for the fire and he had an armchair.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:33.560
Yeah.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.680
He always ate with us.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:35.080
Yeah.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.720
And, erm, yes, so, er, we used to have a, er, we used to have a, er, we used to have

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:37.960
a stove in there and there was a stove.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:37.960


00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.100
So, we always had a boy living in.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.840
And who, who was he?

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.800
Was it a series of people or?

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:47.620
Erm, well, yes, different wa-, er, we, we had a few from St Bride that didn't live

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:51.540
in there, came back and forth, which is the, you know, from Cuck-, or Cuckoo New, but,

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:56.440
erm, a couple of st-, er, actually lived in there, you know, with us and they'd eat with

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.840
us and all this business, you know.

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:02.500
That, erm, I mean, you had a tele-, er, well, not a television, a wireless more like, but

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.320
he did have a television towards the end.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.700
And, erm, yes, we always had a boy living in there.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:07.700


00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.160
I suppose the farm could support that,

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.840
whereas it would be difficult to do that today, wouldn't it?

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:14.780
Well, I suppose, yes.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.620
It's the different ideas today, isn't it?

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:18.000
Yeah.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.920
Different world today, really.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.720
It's changed a lot, really, with farming, hasn't it?

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.480
Did you have sheep, then?

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.720
Yes, we had some sheep, yeah.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.800
Pet lambs and something, you know, feed those.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.420
Yes, I can't remember how many sheep.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.180
We didn't have so many sheep as we know, naturally,

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:38.560
because we had the dairy in as well, you see.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:45.160
Yes, oh yes, I've enjoyed my life up until now.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:51.560
So Ant used to go up onto the seawall and bring the sheep in on ponies.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:51.960
Yes.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.760
Did you ever get involved with that?

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.240
No, not really, no, no.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.140
Yes, we put sheep over on the seawall,

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:05.500
and then Doreen, Derek's father, Philip, would come over

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.160
and...

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.840
and they'd have this horse and a little trap thing, you know,

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:12.380
and they'd sit in there, and they'd go up then to get onto the bus

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.380
and to bring the sheep up and all this business, you know.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.660
And then one day, I don't know what happened, but anyhow,

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.380
the pony started kicking the bottom of the bus in,

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:26.320
and of course got out of the shafts and left these four or five of us,

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.080
and the bus went backwards rather than south.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.740
What, backwards down the slope?

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.940
Well, it went back, but it went back, you know.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.340
I see, because the horse had gone.

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.080
There were shafts.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:36.960
There were shafts hanging over the wall.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:38.660
Were they okay?

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.700
Well, they were all right, and the dog jumped out a bit quick,

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.280
and the dog was in there as well.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.160
Oh dear, yeah.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:50.420
They used to come over every Sunday and go down and see the sheep and all sorts of those,

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:51.420
and bring them up for us.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.360
Because the sheep used to graze on the other side of...

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.020
Yes, yes.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:55.840
Mm-hmm.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:56.480
So...

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:00.660
And then to, like, the tide used to come in so far, you know.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.080
Yeah.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:05.020
But they hired the, I think they hired the bank then.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:11.080
Yes, they did hire it because, of course, the sea, the water was coming,

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.840
the sea was getting higher, wasn't it, you know?

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.720
Because you're very close to the seawall there, aren't you?

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.020
Oh, yes.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.460
It's on the field, really, isn't it?

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:18.860
Yes.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:19.280
The field across.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.220
Did you ever experience the water coming over?

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:26.160
You see it sometimes if it was very rough, just splashing up a bit, you know.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:31.700
But, you know, I never had the thought in mind of thinking,

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.200
oh gosh, I hope it doesn't come over there.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.420
Never thought of that.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:35.840
No.

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.800
I suppose it does, it has, well, it has in some places over the years,

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:40.400
isn't it, you see?

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.520
Did you ever use the shore where the sheet grays?

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.120
Is there like a picnic spot when you had children when you were little?

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:51.460
Yeah, we used to go over there and, like, a lot of the...

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:52.200
Have you been over there?

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.080
You've been over there, of course.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:53.760
Mm.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.180
But I haven't been over there for years, really, so I don't know what it's like.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:02.280
But we used to have little, little, what's the name of the water coming in

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.900
where there's been bits and ditches?

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.220
Yeah, like rivulets.

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:05.860
Yes, yes.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:06.920
Mm-hmm.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.220
Yeah.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:11.060
Yeah, we used to go over there with our neighbours, Eddins, his next farm,

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.760
Slough's Farm, that would be, the one just on the side of the road.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:20.020
And, yeah, we'd go over there for picnics and, yeah, we'd just have a, you know,

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.380
now and again have a good time.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:29.680
Was it, was it, was there a real sense of community there then?

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.280
Down the village, yeah, you mean the village itself?

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:34.760
Yeah.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.480
Oh, yes.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:42.240
Yes, because those, those opposite the hall, those are all built, Susie, because when I went down there first,

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.860
there was no houses there then, you know, so they'd been built.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:48.520
And at the back of the hall is a little cul-de-sac.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:48.980
Yeah.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.640
That's the council houses further over.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:52.180
Mm.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:53.780
They were, they were there when I went down.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.100
Mm.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.540
And different houses being built around there, you know.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:58.420
Yes.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:05.300
Oh, it's nice, I mean, I'm quite upset, really, because WI have been a member for 62 years down there.

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:06.020
Have you?

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:06.520
Yes.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.940
And I used to take my mother-in-law because she didn't drive, Deryn's mother didn't drive.

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:18.580
So when then, after lunch, we'd go down on the second Tuesday, the month, I used to pick her up and we'd go down,

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:25.840
because she was president at that time, and there was the, the old black stowage, I don't know whether you've seen the old round black stowage.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:26.160
Yeah.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:26.800
It was like that.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.100
In the village hall?

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:28.920
In the village hall.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:35.280
And then put the chairs and tables up, and then go back then, and I'd pick her up then for, after tea then, to go to the house.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:35.280


00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.240
So we'd go to WI. And, yes, we did that for years.

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:45.820
And then I used to have the milk van then. I had the milk van for a couple of, oh, for about a week or more in the afternoons,

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:49.720
to go to a place in Bremondy to get a sanding machine.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:56.920
And then, put in the back there, and then we'd do the floor, you know, sand, get the floor all nice and, you know.

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:57.380
Yeah.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:00.220
Yes. Oh, we've had some good times round there. Really good times.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:05.120
So somebody was telling me that St. Bride WI used to have a canning machine.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.120
Yes.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:07.160
Do you know about that?

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:10.500
Yes. Yes. And Mother Prosser had it. Now, where it is, I don't know.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:14.140
Yes, because we used to put fruit into our own canning.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:14.960
Yes.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:20.520
Hmm. Hmm. I wonder where it is. Now, I, I, I'd forgotten about that.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.900
I wonder where that is now.

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.460
Yes, now I wonder where it, where that is.

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.800
You've got me thinking now.

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.500
I'd be trying to explore where it is.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.260
So would they, would they, would they...

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:40.500
Would the WI rent it out, or would they take it out to people and say, do the canning for people?

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:47.440
Er, I could, I wouldn't, I can't say that. I mean, erm, I know we used to borrow it and do our own.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.540
At least Mother Prosser did more than I did, but I'd give a hand, you know.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.700
But, erm, that's interesting how you brought up that canning machine.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.560
I was going to bother you now.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:57.540
I'd be worried about that.

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:00.220
It'd be lovely if it's still around somewhere.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.740
Yes. Yes, it would, wouldn't it?

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:06.300
And it's still going, the St Bride's WI?

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.560
St Bride's? No, no, it's, it's folded up a long time ago.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:11.240
Oh, really? Oh, that's a shame.

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:15.100
Yes, yes, yes. So a lot of the people from there now come to Peterstone.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:19.600
And this is why I'm, I'm rather upset that Peterstone is talking about folding up.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:20.020
Oh.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:25.340
Mm, mm. I mean, the secretary, she's moving away down to Swansea. Well, that's fair enough.

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:31.100
Er, the president, she did say, erm, that, er, she'd do it for another two years.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.500
Well, the two years has come up now.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.840
And no one else wants to take the responsibility.

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:36.700
That's such a shame.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.200
It is a shame. It is a shame.

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:39.580
And it's been going how long?

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.900
Well, I've, I've been down there 62 years.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.800
That's phenomenal, Margaret.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.180
Mm, mm. And it was on a long time before that.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:47.140
Oh.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.560
Yeah, so sad, really.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.420
How many members have you got down there?

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:57.300
Yeah, we, we, we, there's, there's, erm, from St Bride's area, around Asda, where people live,

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.080
er, I expect there's 14 people come from that area.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:07.580
And it, it seems such a shame that, erm, you know, no one will take it on.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:08.960
After all that time?

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:09.680
Yeah, it is.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:16.480
Because I was president for some, about seven years, er, after Mother Pross has given it up, I don't know how long she was.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:21.640
But, erm, no, it's quite sad. I was quite, quite, erm, upset about it, really.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:27.640
But I'm hoping, erm, that I, I might join Kevin Mabley, Michael Stoneman.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:28.020
Mm.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.060
Which is nearer.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:29.560
Yeah.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.480
But, erm, the distance in Michigan.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:32.600
Yeah.

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.260
I don't think it'll make any difference to me.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.300
I was talking about the long...

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.020
Yeah, the longevity, though, isn't it?

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:35.900
Winds, winds and weather.

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:36.300
Yeah.

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:39.220
Pick up a couple of ladies from our school on the way down, you know.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:39.720
Oh, how sweet.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.060
Yeah, she used to enjoy it.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:42.920
That's how it goes, isn't it?

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:49.260
So the, erm, er, so you, you said Mother Pross used to can fruit.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:50.240
Yes.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.000
Where did, where did her fruit come from?

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:55.160
Oh, well, erm, she had, we had plum, plum trees.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:00.340
You know, we had trees, we had plum trees in the, erm, we had a couple of trees around here.

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:00.900
Yeah.

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:04.880
Plum trees and things and then, well, I suppose that was our garden then.

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:05.360
Yeah.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:10.060
You know, and then we'd have beans and stuff like that and, you know, to roast it.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:10.400
Mm.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:14.020
But, erm, yeah, I've, I've forgotten about that canning machine.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.100
So what was the process then?

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.780
So you'd pick the fruit and then wash it, presumably?

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:19.100
Yes.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:20.720
And then put it, make a syrup.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:21.440
Yeah.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.900
And then put it in the tins.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:28.280
And then with the machine you'd seal it all and that would be a tin fruit.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.400
Gosh, and that would last all the winter?

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:30.880
Yeah.

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:34.140
Well, yes, if, you know, you make, you make as much as you can, you know.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:34.240
Yeah.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.040
Or we could.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.660
And, erm, yes, gosh, I'm glad you thought, thought about the canning machine.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:41.340
You've got me worried now.

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:44.640
Well, it's come up a few times, you see, so I thought, how curious.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:45.100
Yes.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.860
I'd never heard of a canning machine before.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:47.220
Yes.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.460
And that St. Bride's WI has a canning machine.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.680
It just sounds really resourceful to me.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.000
Yes, that's right.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:55.520
Yes, yes.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.000
I wonder where that is now.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:04.220
Did the, did the, did the WI, because in the past the WI has been absolutely fantastic

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:07.780
at recording local people and their memories.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:10.500
Did the St. Bride's WI ever do anything like that?

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:16.260
Ah, no, they folded up, as I say, and then a couple of them came from there then, which

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:21.300
are a few more now, because the president it is now, er, she lives in one of the houses

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:22.060
by our stairs.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:22.500
Mm.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.720
And, of course, a couple of her friends have come as well.

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:25.220
Mm.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.980
But, erm, as I say, I, I was quite upset about that.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:27.980


00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.760
I was quite upset last week when I knew that it was going to fold up.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.660
Oh, that is upsetting.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:31.740
Yes, it is, isn't it?

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:32.240
Yeah.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:32.600
Yeah.

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:33.620
But there we are.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:38.040
If people are not interested, you can't, erm, can't force people to be.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.120
You can't, unfortunately.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:39.820
You can try and encourage.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:40.500
Yeah.

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:42.480
But, erm, yeah, so.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:48.400
So, as a young woman, a young wife, was it part, part of your, one's social life, the

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:48.800
WI?

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:49.900
It was, really.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:50.320
Mm.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:51.520
Yes, yes.

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:52.580
I went up to London.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.880
For the two AGMs.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.320
Excuse me.

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:55.600
Just.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:02.500
WI was something that you did as a young wife and it's something you've continued to

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.160
do for a long time.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.780
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.480
I, erm, yes, I enjoyed WI.

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:13.000
I went to London to the AGM on two occasions, which is at the, er, Albert Hall.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:17.360
And that was very interesting where they come from all over the country there and, you know,

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.400
that's, that's gone back a bit.

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:24.960
But, you know, being, it, so what struck me about, you know, down on the moors there,

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:25.580
that it's quite.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.300
It's quite a different landscape, isn't it?

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:27.960
It's flat.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:28.540
Oh, yes.

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:29.560
I think all the watercourses.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:29.920
Yes.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.080
Was that a challenge in some way?

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:36.680
I don't know whether you've found, erm, of course, there's people living in the church

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:42.820
now, the church was, er, was, and on about, oh, what, what am I, five foot, am I five

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:43.380
foot or nothing?

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:43.800
Mm.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:49.540
Er, it's up about, erm, fuck, well, I should know that, was it, where the Great Flood was.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:50.340
Yes, yes.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:51.060
Yes.

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:51.340
Yeah.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.260
And, erm, the bank, you can see the bank.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.240
Now we're one of the fields.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.380
We're one of the farms up, as you go down the road a bit.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:30:58.900
Yeah.

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:05.240
It's, erm, yes, er, well, I think I'm right in saying that the water more or less came

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.160
up near the lip of Castleton.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.960
Yeah, it was, yeah, because it goes down, doesn't it, apparently.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:09.460
Yeah.

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:09.880
Yeah.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.320
It's very low, very low.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.220
Did you ever experience flooding there?

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.160
No.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.040
No.

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.460
The rains would fill up, quite a way, you know.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:17.720
Yeah.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.400
But no, no, we never had any flooding, as such, no.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.140
What was it like having young children around those things, though?

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:25.000
Was it ever a worry?

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.100
Erm, oh, yes, yes.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:32.740
Now, the neighbours further down, the next farm down to, erm, was a farm then, er, they

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:36.480
lost a child that drowned in the, in the, erm, water.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.340
Oh, really?

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:38.920
And also, instant brides.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:42.140
The child drowned instant brides in the rain.

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:42.340
Oh, really?

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:43.660
Yes, yes.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:44.100
Mm.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:49.320
But, erm, I suppose you get, er, I suppose if you're, if you're born down there, you

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:50.100
get used to it.

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:54.120
I know the one that's came down, the one down, er, further on down the road, it's,

00:31:54.120 --> 00:32:00.520
from London, came down to see the sister, erm, came down and brought the little one,

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:04.200
of course, went down the steps and down to the, in the rain there, you know, which was

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.440
very sad, very sad.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.460
Oh, gosh, that's so sad, isn't it?

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:07.300
Mm, terrible, terrible.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.400
Yes, but, erm.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:15.320
When you first went to Sleuthes Farm, was there electricity and stuff?

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:15.820
Yes.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:16.380
Yes, yes.

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:17.820
Yes, yes, yes.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.820
Because when I lived in Langorse, we had no electricity.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:20.320
No?

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:20.780
No.

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:23.220
I got the lighting lamp there, the hanging lighting lamp.

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:23.500
Yeah.

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:27.620
And, erm, I've got lots of table lamps in there that's, er, with oil.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:32.180
And, er, we didn't have any hot water or cold water or anything like that.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.600
Can you talk about the winter of 47?

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.160
What was the winter of 62, 63 like?

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.700
Er, I was down here then, of course.

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:40.540
Oh, here?

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:41.240
It was bad, yes.

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:41.560
Oh, right.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.260
Yes, it was bad then.

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:42.680
Yeah.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:47.500
Erm, I used to have to go up to, I used to go up to Castleton with the tractor, er, to,

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.700
erm, have the lorry to come down, to, you know, to bring me down.

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:51.340
Really?

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:54.100
And then, erm, in the evenings, then, you know, I'd have to go up to the, you know,

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.160
to the, erm, a couple of the locals there, the youngsters.

00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:03.120
He'd, erm, he'd take me down the six bells on a, on a, on a big board, drag it down the,

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.180
down the road, you know.

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.820
Oh, yes, we had quite a lot of snow.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.660
Yes, yes, yes.

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:09.360
But we had more when we langoed.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:12.000
I can remember seeing on Pen Y Van.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:12.480
Yeah.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.880
Er, down one of the crevices in June.

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:16.460
There was still snow.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:17.340
Really?

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:18.580
I can see that now.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:18.820
My goodness.

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.660
Went on and on and on, didn't it?

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.140
Yeah, oh, it did.

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:21.740
It did.

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:21.980
Yeah.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:23.980
Did anyone ever go skating on the Rhine?

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:24.080
No.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:24.080


00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:24.080


00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:24.080


00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:24.080


00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:24.400
On the Rhine?

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:25.900
On the Rhine.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:26.280
On the Rhine.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:26.800
On the Rhine.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.140
On the, on the, oh, sorry, Langos Lake they used to go.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:29.360
Yeah.

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:33.760
But I mean, er, well, it was frozen over and a motorbike went across and it's, er, never

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:34.420
known before.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:35.160
Really?

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.480
It went across the other side.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.440
I've never heard that before.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.600
Mm, mm, yeah.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:39.360
Brave man.

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:39.560
They, they did.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:43.300
But, er, yes, I should say, but many did freeze, didn't they?

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:43.720
Yeah.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:44.740
You know, it's just.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:45.000
Yeah.

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:51.120
And, erm, yeah, we used to go, we used to go and, er, at Crowder River, River of Langos,

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:53.100
we used to take one of these little boats.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:53.660
Er.

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:57.700
And we used to go down to the other side of Langos, Langasti.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:58.080
Mm.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.280
And I don't know where, even with Langos.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:00.520
Mm.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.900
And if you look across there, there's a little hall.

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:03.440
Mm.

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.820
About three fields from the end of the river, I said.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.680
And, er, Langasti Hall.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.720
And we used to go across there to dances.

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:13.620
And we'd take one of these skiff boats, you know.

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:13.900
Yeah.

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:15.400
And we used to row across there.

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:16.120
Did you really?

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:16.540
Yeah.

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:17.260
And, erm.

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.160
It was quite some distance.

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:19.720
Yes, it was really.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:20.040
Yeah.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.880
But when you, you don't notice distance, do you?

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:22.960
I wouldn't do it now.

00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:23.940
I wouldn't do it now.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:28.560
And we used to tether it there and walk up these two fields, go to the dance, come back

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.520
then and row back.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:30.560
My goodness.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.800
Imagine if my daughter was doing that.

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:33.780
I'd be, you know.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.240
Yeah.

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:34.500
That's good.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:35.960
Our parents don't know what we're doing.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:36.260
Yeah.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:36.680
Yeah.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.880
That's what we used to do then years ago when we were young.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:45.040
Do you remember the, erm, did you ever help with hay making as a young farmer's wife?

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:46.600
Er.

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:47.360
Well, yes.

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.700
Dry the tractor, perhaps, and that, you know, the baling.

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:50.200
Oh, OK.

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:53.640
And, of course, we had, erm, I don't know, a four-horse.

00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:53.640


00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:54.340
I don't know.

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:59.000
I might have got a photograph here where, erm, just kind of, excuse me.

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.840
And what's this prize here then, Margaret?

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.120
Well, this is when I was, I was first lady chairman of, erm, of St. Melon's Show.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.980
Now you, that was a big show someone said to me.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:11.420
Oh, yes.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.160
Oh, it was lovely.

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:12.920
Oh, yes.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:13.260
Yeah.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.240
Fair play it was.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.300
And I still look forward to St. Melon's Show.

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.240
So is it a very strong farming community?

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:23.040
Is it a very close-knit farming community?

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:23.620
Farming.

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:24.100
Farming.

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.320
Yes, I think, yeah, I think so.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:26.240
Yes, yes.

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:27.880
You know, we do a lot of things together.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.480
We had two donkeys.

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:33.640
And, erm, I had this donkey down at Slough's.

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:35.800
And then we put her in foal.

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:40.420
And, oh, you've never seen such a sweet thing when there's little one came.

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:42.480
I think the whole village came down to see it.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:42.980
Really?

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.520
Oh, just the, the deal thing.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.500
Someone told me that farmers kept donkeys because they were good luck.

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:53.560
Well, yes, they, they, they, they, erm, they do, a lot of people have had a donkey.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:53.680
Yeah.

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:53.680


00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:54.480
Yeah, a lot of donkeys with a, with cattle.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.000
Hmm.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:55.480
Hmm.

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:55.880
Hmm.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.160
Well, I've never heard that before.

00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:57.840
Yes, yes.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:02.940
I don't know whether it's, or there's, there, spent it, there's a little one, single.

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:03.480
Wow.

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.080
This is 1955.

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.440
I sold my sheep and I bought the little sports car.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:09.820
Is that you?

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:10.280
Yeah.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.360
No, that's not me.

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:12.800
My, that's my mother and my aunt.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.280
But that's the little car I bought.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.220
You bought it?

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:15.520
Yeah.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:17.400
I sold the sheep and I bought the little car.

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:19.400
Oh, I think that's so impressive.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.000
That must have Parkinson's been very unusual for you young woman then.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.600
Yeah, oh yeah, we used to have some fun. We used to go following the hounds.

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:27.760
Did you?

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:39.380
Yeah, on the top there. And then one day, walking back to the car, here comes the local policeman with a steering wheel in his hand. He took the steering wheel off.

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:39.940
Why?

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.460
I went to Blackpool in that, and back.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.840
Oh my goodness, me? What sort of car is it?

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:51.480
It was a built-up Le Mans Singer. It had a Singer engine.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:58.140
I am so impressed with you. Oh my goodness. And so you followed the hounds down on the moors?

00:36:58.420 --> 00:36:59.040
Yes, yeah.

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:01.000
Really? Derek was telling me about that.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.720
Yes, yes, the Shudiga hunt.

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.660
Oh, so where would you go?

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:11.960
And the Shudiga hunt was based in Bayslake, but it's all been built on now.

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:12.360
Yeah?

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:16.400
So they've gone up to Gellie Gare, the hounds up there.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:16.700
Yeah.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:21.260
So, I mean, we use them if we have dead stock or something.

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:21.600
Yeah.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.560
We pay so much a year for them to pick up, to take it up to the year, you know.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:28.140
But then you would follow them in your car, would you?

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:28.420
Yeah, yeah.

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:29.920
And who would you do that with?

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.540
And I sang Top of Pen-a-Lan. I don't know, Top of Pen-a-Lan.

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:32.760
Yeah.

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:34.100
Up there, we'd be up there.

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:35.700
That's like an orchard there.

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.300
Yes, yeah, we used to have trees.

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.240
So did you get apples off those as well?

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:42.940
Yes, apples and pears.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.060
Did you ever make cider from them?

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:47.100
No, no, but we used to can them.

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:47.640
Can them?

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.380
Mm-hmm.

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.860
Gosh, that's lovely. So where is the orchard then?

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:51.980
This was my...

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:53.780
So where was the orchard here?

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:54.700
There.

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:55.800
Oh, gosh.

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:56.460
Yes.

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:56.800
Okay.

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.320
And this was my garden over here.

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.140
Did you ever have horses on your farm?

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:05.320
No.

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:05.940
No?

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:06.680
No.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:06.860
No.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:07.940
Not just the two donkeys.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:08.820
Oh, we did...

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.460
Oh, gosh, that's me when I was...

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:12.060
Oh, I shouldn't be showing you this.

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:13.040
This is 1951.

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:13.500
Oh, please do.

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:17.760
I represented Miss Langorse in Breconshire.

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:19.260
Really?

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.460
So when it was haymaking...

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:24.680
Would you have had to make all the lunches for everyone coming in?

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:25.580
Who was helping with the haymaking?

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:29.740
Yeah, usually in the evening I'd cook ham, potatoes and stuff like that.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:30.040
Yeah.

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:31.600
They'd come in at supper time.

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:31.980
Yeah.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.360
Not so much in the daytime.

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:35.840
I mean, they'd have something to eat, sandwiches or something.

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.160
But I used to cook them in the evening, you know, for them to come in.

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:40.400
Yeah, and they'd come back.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:40.540
Oh.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.780
Yeah, we had a lovely life, really.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:44.560
And that was me.

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:46.260
So did you ever...

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:50.660
You were probably then too young to have ever thatched hay ricks then and stuff.

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.140
Well, yeah, I've seen them done.

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:55.060
Have you?

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:55.500
Yes.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:59.080
When I was at my grandparents', they used to do it there.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:04.980
But of course, we've always had the bands and of course the bales now, but we used to do small bales.

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:05.220
Yeah.

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:09.580
I think there's a certain amount of small bales now, if I remember rightly.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.580
Because it's the round ones now, isn't it?

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.340
Yes, of course.

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:14.840
You know, the big round ones.

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.620
Yeah, so times have altered.

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:18.980
So was there any...

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.460
There's something I've been meaning to ask and I've forgotten to ask.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:21.460


00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:21.460


00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:21.460


00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:21.460


00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.080
I'll ask everybody else.

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:29.680
But was there, excuse me, any food or meals?

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:44.020
So, for example, my parents are Irish and a traditional meal we would have would be boiled ham, Parsi sauce and something called chump, which was potatoes and onions and cabbage.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:44.780
Yes, yeah.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.700
Is there anything on the moors that was traditional like that?

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:49.560
Any particular dishes or...

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:50.680
I used to always boil ham.

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:51.340
Yeah.

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.340
You know, I like boiled ham.

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.240
It's nice and potatoes and stuff like that.

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:57.720
No, I suppose...

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:05.440
I think it's a thing that's a farmhouse meal, isn't it?

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:05.720
Yeah.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:09.760
Boiled ham, potatoes, peas, Parsi sauce.

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:10.380
Yeah.

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.180
You know, that type of thing, isn't it?

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:16.720
So you would always be in the kitchen providing food for people working on the farm?

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.240
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.000
Oh, yes, yes.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.080
Yes, yes.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:20.760
And...

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.460
Yeah.

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:21.920
And...

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.980
Yes, I used to go out and feed the chicken in there.

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:27.460
I used to feed the poultry, you know, feed the poultry and all that.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:34.200
But, yes, and they'd come in then about two, I was 10, 11 o'clock and then they'd sit down

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.140
and have supper and then they'd go about 12 o'clock, 1 o'clock.

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:37.840
Wow.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:38.820
Wow.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.560
Yes, yeah.

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.140
I always enjoyed the hay making.

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:42.980
You know, the harvest time used to be lovely.

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:43.620
Great.

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:44.260
Well, why was...

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:44.760
What was it...

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:45.880
Why did you like it?

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:46.580
Because it was just a...

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:48.020
Well, I think...

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:48.860
Well, meeting...

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:51.240
They used to come in and I was in...

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:56.020
And then, you know, we'd go hauling the bales and all this business, you know, the loose

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:56.720
hay years ago.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:57.140
Yeah.

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:59.740
I thought I had a photograph here of...

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:01.060
I haven't got one.

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:04.360
I thought I had a photograph here of the...

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:05.760
Oh, what was it?

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:10.120
So, do you remember any of the people who used to work for the drainage board that used

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.320
to come round and clear the reams and stuff?

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:17.260
Oh, dear, what was his name?

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:20.200
I can see him now.

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:20.960
Oh, really?

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:22.560
Oh.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:24.680
Oh.

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:25.960
Oh, they look into me in a moment.

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:30.580
Yes, he was just slashed, you know, with a long-handled hook.

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:31.700
Oh, do you remember that?

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:32.200
Down the broadway.

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:32.600
Yeah.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:33.760
Down the broadway, particularly.

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:34.320
Mm.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:35.440
Um...

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:36.160
Oh.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.960
Well, the one that's died now back a couple of months ago...

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:45.180
Mm.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:46.160
Um...

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:47.600
Oh.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:49.720
Hmm.

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.220
I can't think of the name.

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:51.780
I can't think of the other gentleman.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.360
I can see him now doing this, you know.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:56.800
Well, he's silly, isn't he?

00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.280
He'll come to you.

00:41:58.460 --> 00:41:59.040
He'll come.

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:02.220
And so, Dilwyn was on the drainage board.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.340
Yeah, Dilwyn was on the drainage board, and his father was before him.

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:05.580
Yeah.

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:07.000
So, what did that mean?

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:11.180
Does it mean just, you know, was it an important role?

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:16.140
Well, I suppose it controlled the reams and everything, really, wasn't it?

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.680
The drainage board, more or less.

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.860
You know, it was to see that they were cut in the reed.

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:24.240
The reeds were cut and everything from off the sides.

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:25.220
Yeah.

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:28.760
And I suppose controlled the gates.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:29.560
Yes.

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:32.800
It opened out opposite the bottom of the broadway.

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:33.500
Yes.

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:33.940
Yeah.

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:35.040
The gates are automatic.

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:36.780
It's all automatic now, you see.

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:37.160
Yeah, it's all changed.

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:39.900
Years ago, it used to have to be done more or less by hand.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:40.340
Yeah.

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:40.860
You know.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:42.880
So, it's...

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.080
The Moors are very interested, really.

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:45.760
Mm.

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:48.600
Very interesting, aren't they, in different things?

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:49.340
I think so.

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:49.600
Yes.

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:50.960
I think it's fascinating, actually.

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:51.840
It's so different.

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.140
What about fish?

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:57.020
Did you ever get eels in the reed, or...?

00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:57.460
Oh, yes.

00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:01.040
Yes, down the bottom of the sluice, you know.

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:01.220
Yeah.

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:02.740
You used to have eels out of there.

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:03.280
Did you?

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.040
Yes, yes.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:04.700
Mm.

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:05.960
What, you used to cut them?

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:06.800
Oh, yes.

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:07.700
I used to love to eat them.

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:08.420
Really?

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.480
So, how did you catch them and cut them?

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:15.180
Oh, you'd catch them with a rod.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:16.920
Yeah.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.420
And put something on the end of it, you know, and catch them like that.

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:20.900
And you'd put them in the bucket then.

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:21.160
Yeah.

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:26.980
So, as, you know, they'd have fresh water, and then you'd kill them and eat them.

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:27.880
How long would you keep...?

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:28.640
I wouldn't.

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:29.420
He wouldn't.

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:30.040
Oh, no.

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:33.320
But you would keep them in the fresh bucket for a few days, fresh of water?

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:33.700
Oh, yes.

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:37.380
Change the water for a day or two, so as they get the, well...

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:37.880
The earthy stuff?

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.020
Yes, the earthy stuff.

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:39.380
Yeah.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.320
Otherwise, you'd be eating earth.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.280
So, you would do that?

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:42.980
Yeah.

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:43.600
Really?

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:44.100
Yeah.

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:45.780
And then you would skin it?

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:47.500
Skin it, and then cook it.

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:47.860
Yeah.

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.720
Fry it in the frying pan, chop it up in bits.

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:50.460
Really?

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:50.660
Really.

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:52.200
But they were very keen.

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:53.900
I mean, I enjoy anything.

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:54.500
Yeah.

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:56.540
Or everything, put it that way.

00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:56.840
Yeah.

00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:58.520
I'm not fussy with my food.

00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.240
I enjoy a lot.

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.520
That's a good free source of food, though.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:02.500
Yeah, it is, yes.

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:03.980
What about elvers?

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:06.160
Was that something anyone ever had down there?

00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:06.560
No.

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:07.040
No.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.020
I don't think so.

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:09.000
No, no.

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:16.400
Down the bottom end of the drive, of course, and they'd have them down there.

00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:20.360
I need to get them up through the, you know, up the field.

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:22.700
I don't know if you've got them under the rostrums.

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:22.940
Did you?

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:23.440
Mm.

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:24.220
Really?

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:25.200
Yes, yeah, yeah.

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:26.220
Crikey.

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:27.200
Oh, yes.

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:31.900
It's, um, it's fascinating, really, isn't it, when you think back what you've seen and done.

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:33.320
What about church?

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:37.080
Did your family ever go to church, you know, when you were down living on?

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:40.260
Yes, I used to go to St Peter's Church, which is the big church in the village.

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:40.640
Yeah.

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:41.820
But, of course, that closed.

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:42.300
Mm.

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.980
And, um, it's a house now, prison.

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:47.800
Is that something the whole family would go to?

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:49.480
Uh, yes.

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:50.200
Sunday morning.

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:52.340
I used to try and go to church all of Sunday evening.

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:52.780
Mm.

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:54.940
I mean, Father Prosser was a church warden there.

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:55.620
Was he?

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:56.220
During his father.

00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:56.680
Yeah.

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.200
Oh, yes, he was a big churchman.

00:44:58.360 --> 00:44:58.860
Was he?

00:44:59.060 --> 00:44:59.760
Yes, yes.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:00.880
And Mother used to go.

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:01.940
Mother Prosser used to go.

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:02.340
Yeah.

00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:08.200
And they were on occasionally, and, um, they were married in Peterstone Church.

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:12.560
But, of course, it closed then, a little while after.

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.520
And, um, it's a house now.

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:16.500
People's got it as a house.

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:16.860
Yeah, yeah.

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:18.220
They were living in there.

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:18.820
I don't know.

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:20.200
Unfortunately, the gentleman.

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:20.900
They're dying now.

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:25.380
Only last year, um, his wife and the child are still there.

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.480
But, um, apparently they were.

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:29.840
I've never been in there since, naturally.

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:31.480
But they were living in pods.

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:32.980
Were they?

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.320
It's a big church, man.

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:34.840
It's huge.

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:35.320
High.

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:36.080
Crikey.

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:36.620
Tremendous.

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:37.320
Oh, yeah.

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:37.920
Tremendous height.

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:38.340
Yeah.

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.040
Been up the top of the tower.

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.420
Lovely view from there.

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:41.900
Really?

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:42.280
Mm-hmm.

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:43.680
Yeah.

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:46.120
Would the congregation have been very big?

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:49.140
Um, well, yes.

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.340
It varied then.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.400
You know, it's like Marshfield is a bigger church.

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:53.620
Yeah.

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:57.840
Or they do get more congregation there.

00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.900
Because I suppose it's in a bigger village, isn't it?

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:00.480
Mm-hmm.

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:01.840
And that's a nice church, too.

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:02.760
It's a Mary's church.

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.060
I've got, um, doings.

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:06.600
I've got a rose tree down there for doing.

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.360
But I've also got a casket up in the field up here.

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:10.000
Have you?

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.640
Of his ashes, yes.

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:12.120
Oh.

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:13.940
And, um.

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:18.260
Do you remember any characters that stand out for you or that you remember?

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:19.900
Well, um.

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:23.740
Before the buildings that are over the other side of the road now, there were buildings,

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.300
but not like they are now.

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:27.920
And there used to be an old fellow living in there.

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:28.580
Yeah.

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:31.060
And, um, Dennis, his name was.

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.500
And, uh, he used to wear a long, long coat.

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.580
Uh, he lived in there.

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:41.080
And there was a grate in the corner where you'd have a bit of a fireplace if you wanted it.

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:45.700
And Dennis, and he'd walk from there then into town, or Rumney.

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:46.200
Yeah.

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:46.740
And walk back.

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:47.560
I can see him now.

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:48.580
It was in the stages ago.

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:49.120
Yeah.

00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:49.300
Yeah.

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:49.320


00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:49.500
Yeah.

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:49.580
Yeah.

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:49.840
Yeah.

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:49.880
Yeah.

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:49.880


00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:49.880


00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:49.880


00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:49.880


00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:50.740
He was in a long, long black coat.

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:57.920
And then there was another one down at, um, uh, the farm down at, um, St. Bride's.

00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:02.600
And his name was, um, he was another character.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.600
They, um, oh, I can't, I can't think of his name.

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:10.840
He lived in a, in a barn.

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:16.040
Well, they kind of like, I don't like to use the word tramp, but kind of like a, just somebody

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:16.500
who used to.

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:19.760
Well, they were, yes, they were kind of a tramp.

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:20.200
Yeah.

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:20.740
Yeah.

00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:20.740


00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:20.860
You know.

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:21.380
Yeah.

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:23.420
And Billy Mitch, that was down there.

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:24.280
That's right.

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:28.360
And Dennis used to be in this one that, um, in our, in our barn over there.

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:29.680
They were no trouble.

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:36.040
I mean, you know, they, um, actually, I think Father Prosser, uh, went over there one day

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:38.480
and, and he, he died in the, lost him, so.

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:39.200
Really?

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:40.520
Had to get the police and all that.

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:41.120
It was a bit of a.

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:41.660
Yeah.

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:42.260
Lost him, you know.

00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:45.620
But, um, no, there were characters about then, weren't there?

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:46.240
Yeah.

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.540
Years ago like that.

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:48.320
They'd, um.

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.720
Um, uh, well, I can, I can see them.

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:53.360
I can place them now.

00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:55.300
And it's going back a little while.

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:58.600
Yes, Dennis and, uh, Billy Mitch used to call him.

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:03.560
And he'd always, um, and if the, they'd reckon as if the airplanes were coming over during

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:06.120
the war, because that was when he was there down the wall.

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:09.940
Um, he turned his pipe upside down in case he's.

00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:11.520
Oh.

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:11.860
No, that.

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:13.320
Oh, isn't that lovely?

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:13.660
Yeah.

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:14.040
Yeah.

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:14.600
Isn't that lovely?

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:16.000
It's a comic moment, isn't it?

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:16.720
Isn't it a thing?

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:17.820
Because they might see his pipe.

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:18.640
Oh, right.

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:19.120
And he uses it.

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:22.580
Oh, it is really funny.

00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:23.000
Yeah.

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:23.860
Funny.

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:27.300
Someone was telling me now, where was it now?

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:29.480
I can't remember.

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.280
Oh, something about that.

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:36.400
Was it St. Bride's or was it somewhere else there?

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:37.020
I might be wrong.

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:40.500
That on the Sunday the pubs used to be closed in Wales.

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:42.840
This is when the border was different.

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:46.680
So people used to flood over to here to use the pubs on the Sunday.

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:47.300
Is that right?

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:48.040
Yeah.

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:49.280
Maybe I've got that wrong.

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:52.860
Um, no, they used to.

00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:57.620
There was a law, wasn't there, where the pubs used to close on the Sunday in a lot of places.

00:48:57.980 --> 00:48:58.120
Um.

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:04.660
But I can't, I can't remember where that, um, you know, it was, um, wasn't with ours.

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:07.040
I might have got that wrong, actually.

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.440
I mean, it's, I feel very sad really.

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:10.820
The Six Bells is closed.

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:11.320
Yeah.

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:12.260
You know.

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:12.520
Yeah.

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:16.580
I mean, and that's, that was, there was two cottages at the site of that.

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:16.940
Yeah.

00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:18.020
And, um, I don't know.

00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:18.020


00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:18.020


00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:18.020


00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:18.020


00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:18.020


00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:18.020


00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:18.020


00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:20.600
It's, it's a, it was a, um, was it a popular pub?

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:21.600
Oh, yes.

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:24.460
Oh, we've got a lot of lovely times down there.

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:24.840
Have you?

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:25.940
Especially Christmas time.

00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:26.340
Yeah.

00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:29.560
You know, we'd go down there and then somebody would be playing the organ.

00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:31.880
I mean, have a good old sing-song and that, you know.

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:32.180
Yeah.

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:32.440
Yeah.

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:35.400
And, um, oh, I think I got a photograph.

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:37.880
I'm, I'm boring you with these photographs.

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:37.880


00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:38.240
You are not.

00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:39.980
I love photographs, Margaret.

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:41.580
I really do love photographs.

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:43.520
Mm-hmm .

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:47.540
This is the Six Bells.

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:48.000
Oh.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:48.000


00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:48.000


00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:48.000


00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.520
With all the horses.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.600
No, that's interesting.

00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:54.000
I think I might have seen that photograph before.

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:54.880
Have you? Maybe.

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.780
No, I think...

00:49:58.780 --> 00:49:59.620
He was the master.

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:04.260
So which pack is this?

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:05.560
This would be the...

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:08.240
What's it?

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:10.080
Tredegar.

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:10.720
Tredegar.

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:11.940
Tredegar hunt, yes.

00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:13.920
And this is the one you used to follow in your sports car?

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:14.540
Yeah.

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:16.520
Yes, that's right, yes.

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:18.600
Oh, and who's this?

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:21.860
Do you know where this is taken?

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:23.980
No, I'm not certain of that.

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:28.260
And see, there was two cottages at the side of the six barrels.

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:28.940
Oh, yes, yes.

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:30.560
And then this is...

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:33.160
What was this, Ken Philp?

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.940
Only now, last year.

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:39.300
Because it looks like it's been closed for years, doesn't it?

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:40.120
Yes, it does, yes.

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:41.460
It looks a bit of a mess, doesn't it?

00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:42.100
Yeah, yeah.

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.780
Yes, it's a shame because we had a lot of fun down there.

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:45.100
Yeah.

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:45.960
Yes.

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:48.960
I just met, thinking about the St. Melon's show.

00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:49.740
Yes.

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:50.220
I mean...

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:51.020
That's folded now.

00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:51.780
That's folded.

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.240
But I understand that was a huge event in its time.

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.560
Yes, yes, it was very good.

00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:58.340
We had tremendous times with the show.

00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.280
We used to be on the...

00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:04.380
First of all, the St. Melon's show used to be at Rimley,

00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:06.820
on the top of Rimley Hill.

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.960
And then it came then to...

00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:12.040
Oh, what's there now?

00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:12.640
Oh.

00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:15.440
The only one...

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:15.680
Good.

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:16.040
You know.

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:18.940
Bakers used to have the farm.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:20.340
Oh.

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:23.660
Well, all these...

00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:24.400
Oh, dear.

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:25.300
I can't think of the name.

00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:29.920
Oh, that's silly, isn't it?

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.840
You know, when you go down now towards Newport.

00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:32.240
Yes.

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:34.560
All these buildings on the right-hand side

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:35.720
and this left-hand side.

00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:37.040
Like a radiator plant and...

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:37.460
That's right.

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:38.340
That's right, yes.

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:39.040
Suffering.

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.060
We used to have the show there.

00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:40.880
Did you?

00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:42.620
And then we came then to Kevin Mabley here

00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:43.820
down the bottom of this lane.

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:44.060
Yeah.

00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:44.900
Where you came over the bridge.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:45.240
Yeah.

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:45.460
Yeah.

00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:45.800
Yeah.

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:45.940
Yeah.

00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:45.940


00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:45.940


00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:45.940


00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:45.940


00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:45.940


00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:45.940


00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:45.940


00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:46.420
Farm Park.

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:46.640
Yeah.

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:47.880
We used to have it there.

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:48.600
Oh, really?

00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:49.560
Yes, in the big field there.

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:50.040
Yeah.

00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:52.760
And, oh, yes.

00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:54.980
And then we went then to Jadica House.

00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:55.540
Yeah.

00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:56.840
But it was never the same.

00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:57.920
Not really.

00:51:58.440 --> 00:51:59.700
You know, we used to get...

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.060
I don't know why it was

00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:02.240
because it was a nice site.

00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:06.240
But we didn't get the agricultural side of things.

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:06.660
Yeah.

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:07.460
It changed.

00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:08.660
It changed altogether.

00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:09.500
Yeah.

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:12.220
So where it was used to be by Koikernu...

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:12.720
Yes.

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:13.420
What was it...

00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:15.020
So where that area is now,

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:15.940
it's completely developed.

00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:16.560
It's developed, isn't it?

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:17.000
Oh, yes.

00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:17.380
Yeah.

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:18.660
Was it just farmland then?

00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:19.480
It was farmland.

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:20.100
Yes.

00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:21.220
It's hard to imagine.

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:22.080
It is.

00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:22.780
It is, isn't it?

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:25.180
So before the motorway and everything,

00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:26.460
it was...

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:26.800
Yes.

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:27.280
Well, of course,

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:29.920
they were talking about putting another road up

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.660
onto the motorway.

00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:31.900
Yeah.

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:32.640
Yeah.

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:33.600
I don't know where that's going to happen.

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:33.980
I don't know.

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:35.240
But it was just farmland?

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:35.820
Yes.

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:36.100
Yes.

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:37.840
Because you still live there.

00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:40.420
And it was where all the local farmers

00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:41.340
would go along there,

00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:41.740
would they,

00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:42.880
to present,

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.580
show their livestock?

00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:45.340
Yes.

00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:45.660
Yes.

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:47.020
It was a proper agriculture show.

00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:47.620
Oh, yes, it was.

00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:48.180
Definitely.

00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:49.200
Everything was there.

00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:49.600
Yeah.

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:50.060
Yes.

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:53.560
And the local show now is Mackenshow.

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:54.460
OK.

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:54.980
And that's...

00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:56.580
I was on the first Saturday of July.

00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:57.100
Yeah.

00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:58.180
And that's a nice little show.

00:52:58.360 --> 00:52:58.640
Yeah.

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:00.680
And that's as big as what St. Melon's was,

00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:01.060
you know.

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:03.300
But, oh, yes.

00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:05.340
Oh, yes, we've had a lot of fun at the shows.

00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:06.060
Yeah.

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:06.600
Lovely.

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.100
But there are things altered,

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:09.480
aren't there,

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:09.960
over the years?

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:10.240
Yeah, they do.

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:11.020
You know.

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:13.840
I was just going to ask you about the Lighthouse pub.

00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:15.520
Is that something that...

00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:17.240
Locals would have ever used.

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:19.880
Was it something people from out of town would use?

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:23.160
Have you been down to the Lighthouse pub?

00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:24.360
Oh, it's very pleasant.

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.660
And a lot of people used to walk on the bank,

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:27.720
you know, across the bank.

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:28.140
Really?

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:28.520
Mm.

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:28.960
Mm.

00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:32.440
What, would people walk along from Cardiff along here?

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:32.860
Yes.

00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:35.300
Well, yeah, sort of from Remedy, perhaps, you know,

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:38.120
walk and then see them go back and that, you know.

00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:38.280
Oh.

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:39.180
Yes, yeah.

00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:40.700
Oh, it's very pleasant.

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:41.740
And there is a nice day.

00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:42.420
Yeah, it is.

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:42.900
It's nice.

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:43.360
You know, it's...

00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:45.080
You go up and you can see

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:45.740
both sides.

00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:46.240
Yeah.

00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:48.760
I'm sure he was telling me that

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:51.800
that people used to

00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:54.860
stay in almost like a chalet,

00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:55.600
a seat shack

00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:56.700
in...

00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:57.580
in...

00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:58.360
on the...

00:53:58.360 --> 00:53:59.200
by the sea wall.

00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:00.300
Is that right?

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:01.220
At St. Bride's.

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:02.080
At St. Bride's?

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:02.340
Yes.

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:02.940
Or was it...

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:04.780
They've got caravans there now.

00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:06.480
I don't think he meant the caravan,

00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:08.180
that people would rent out...

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.280
would come out for the weekend and...

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:12.180
Maybe he did mean the caravan, actually.

00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:14.320
I didn't think he did mean that.

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:14.900
Yeah.

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:15.740
Maybe I got that wrong.

00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:18.020
He said people would come out for the day

00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:19.520
on their bikes and...

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.260
Oh, a lot of people used to go

00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:22.660
to St. Bride's.

00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:23.020
Really?

00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:23.460
Yes, yes.

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:24.120
Yeah.

00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:24.320
Mm.

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:25.160
Yes.

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:26.980
And of course they'd have these little

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:28.460
tent things, wouldn't they?

00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:29.500
Oh, really?

00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:30.540
Yes, yes.

00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:32.020
You see those down there.

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:32.460
What?

00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:33.340
Like people would camp?

00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:34.280
Yes, yes.

00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:35.740
They'd sleep in there and then...

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:36.060
Really?

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:36.720
Mm.

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:37.500
But what...

00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:38.460
Along by the wall?

00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:39.160
Or...?

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:40.420
Um, not so much the wall,

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.960
but before they put the caravan sites,

00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:45.060
because they're a fair bit of caravan sites,

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:46.040
I did St. Bride's apparently.

00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:46.520
Yeah.

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:47.700
Which I haven't been there for years.

00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.000
Excuse me.

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:53.260
And, um, they used to have these little tent things,

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:55.060
you know, you see it on the television, don't you?

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:55.760
Really?

00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:56.320
Yes.

00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:56.520
Mm.

00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:56.920
Mm.

00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:57.540
Yes.

00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:58.680
Oh, I didn't know that.

00:54:59.080 --> 00:54:59.700
Yes, it's...

00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:02.360
Yes, times have changed, haven't they?

00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:03.320
Yeah, they have.

00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:04.120
They have.

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:06.640
I said, it's one thing I have to ask you about,

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:07.680
because I was asking about it,

00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:09.600
because part of what I'm doing is, um,

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:12.960
maybe talking to people who live along the moors,

00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:14.860
but, um, that includes people,

00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:16.000
people from the Gypsy community.

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:16.820
Mm-hmm.

00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:21.720
Um, do you remember any Gypsies coming through and...?

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:23.940
Well, when we had ground in, um,

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.820
we rented ground on the corner down in St. Bride's,

00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:28.220
in, um, um...

00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:30.540
Uh...

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:33.340
Well, where the Gypsy caravan is,

00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:34.340
that site is now.

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:34.620
Yeah.

00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:34.620


00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:36.960
Uh, there used to be the old...

00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:39.560
She was an old Gypsy in the proper old...

00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:41.060
Uh...

00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:41.500
Rangtongue.

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:41.980
Yeah.

00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:42.300
Yeah.

00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:44.720
And they were there for years on the corner,

00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:45.380
and they were out of our field,

00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:47.680
and we used to have to just pass them, you know,

00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:48.940
to go into the field.

00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:49.240
Yeah.

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:50.600
And they'd give no trouble at all.

00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:52.200
But these are not Gypsies, are they?

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:53.000
Mm.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.480
Not being unkind, they're travellers.

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:54.960
No, I know.

00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:55.120
Yeah.

00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:55.640


00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:56.080
You know?

00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:56.280
Yeah.

00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:59.780
And, I mean, I mean, they got horses tethered,

00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:01.840
and, uh, well, a friend of mine,

00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:03.960
she saw this little tiny pony one day,

00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:05.500
and she thought the pull...

00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:06.460
I don't know, any tweets.

00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:09.940
She came home and took some hay down to give it on the road.

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:10.120
Oh.

00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:11.060
You know?

00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:11.820
It's sad.

00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:13.660
No, these are travellers more, I think.

00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:14.340
You know, it's...

00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:15.900
They're not the proper Gypsy.

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:16.360
Mm.

00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:17.460
I don't think.

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:19.440
There we are.

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:20.840
That's life, I suppose, isn't it?

00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:21.860
It is, I suppose.

00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:24.140
And there's so many of them now, isn't there?

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:27.660
So, do you know, you go towards Cardiff and Rumley,

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:28.680
from where I live now.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:29.320
Yes.

00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:31.800
I mean, again, when you first arrived,

00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:34.440
was that just agricultural land?

00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:35.640
Oh, yes, all just fields.

00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:36.200
Mm.

00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:36.740
Mm.

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:38.800
It's hard for me to imagine.

00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:39.960
Yes, yes, mm.

00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:42.540
Yes, and, of course, there's the, um,

00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:44.420
uh, KLG.

00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:44.840
Yeah.

00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:46.280
Which is a bit firm opposite, isn't it?

00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:46.780
Yeah.

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:49.220
Uh, do motor things.

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:51.520
But, uh, oh, yes, it was all...

00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:53.200
It's most unfortunate.

00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.560
I mean, there's a little house there as you go down

00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:58.160
towards, um, the caravan site.

00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:01.560
On the right-hand side, um, he was the coalman,

00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:02.900
Mr Sadler.

00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:05.180
And I look at it now and I think to myself,

00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:07.520
oh, if he came back and saw us...

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:07.980
Right.

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.980
Yeah, he'd be very, very upset about it, you know?

00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:11.440
Yeah.

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:12.920
He was the coalman?

00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:13.660
Yes.

00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:14.660
So he delivered coal?

00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:15.740
He delivered coal, yes.

00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:16.880
He had the bags of coal.

00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:17.280
Mm.

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:17.900
Yes.

00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:18.460
Mm.

00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:19.200
Mm.

00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:19.200


00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.120
Mr Sadler.

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.940
I, his son is still alive.

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.840
Uh, he lives in Brumney.

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:24.680
Oh.

00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:26.200
I've seen him for some time, actually.

00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:29.320
But as the house was, it was immaculate, you know?

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:32.480
But as it is now, the slates are gone and...

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:34.400
Oh, it's, it's a mess.

00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:35.220
Oh.

00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:36.040
He'd break his heart.

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:38.500
Do you remember a nurse...

00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:40.100
I thought it was Nurse Cox.

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:40.940
She was the midwife.

00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:41.960
Oh, yes, yes.

00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:43.180
Yes.

00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:44.140
Now, um...

00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:46.360
She lived on the top of Pen-a-Land, didn't she?

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:47.360
That's right.

00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:49.300
Well, there were two cottages there.

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:54.120
And I'm very friendly with, um, uh, Betty Stephens, her name is now.

00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:55.000
She was Betty Bridge.

00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:58.420
Uh, lived in there, one of those, and her brother.

00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:01.500
And, um, uh, those...

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:02.400
What, of course, are they gone?

00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:03.380
What's that?

00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:04.240
Yes, Nurse Cox.

00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:07.080
And there was another nurse who lived up there, too.

00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:09.180
Because Nurse Cox moved down to Castleton.

00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:09.920
Yes.

00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:13.960
On the left-hand side, as you go down off the main road.

00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:14.240
Hmm.

00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:15.340
Oh, yes.

00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:17.460
She used to go round delivering the babies and all.

00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:17.860
Yeah.

00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:20.520
Did she deliver Andrew and your daughter?

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:22.580
No, I went into Glossop.

00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:23.460
Oh, did you?

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:24.060
Yes, yes.

00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:25.380
I went into Glossop, Tansley.

00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:25.700
Yeah.

00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:26.180
Yeah.

00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:26.720
Yeah.

00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:28.440
I just stayed in with both of them, actually.

00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:30.800
But, um, yes.

00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:33.640
Oh, you're bringing back memories for me, as well.

00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:34.180
Oh.

00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:36.640
Well, I, I, uh, met her...

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:38.980
Well, I suppose we got hedgerows here.

00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:40.580
When I was down there, there was the Reans.

00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:41.180
Ah.

00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:42.220
You know.

00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:42.540
Yeah.

00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:44.120
Um, but, um...

00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:45.200
Not really, I suppose.

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:45.620
No.

00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:47.100
No, the grass is the same.

00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:47.500
It's green.

00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:48.160
Yeah.

00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:48.700
Yeah.

00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:51.460
And you drove, drove a tractor from early on?

00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:52.580
Oh, yes.

00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:52.940
Yes.

00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:53.380
Yes.

00:58:53.460 --> 00:59:00.220
I drove, I drove, when we moved from Langorse down to Berryhill, um, on a Ferguson, Ferguson

00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:06.260
25, excuse me, um, I did three journeys from Langorse down to Berryhill.

00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:07.620
It took me four and a half hours.

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:08.840
Really?

00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:11.240
With the trailer behind, with implements and stuff.

00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:12.720
Brought them down to Berryhill Farm.

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:18.720
And, um, and then when I was going back, do you know the way, do you know, um, Pontypool

00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:19.800
area much?

00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:21.220
You know, I...

00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:22.640
I've been to Pontyboil recently.

00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:23.540
Pontyboil?

00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:23.840
Yeah.

00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:24.740
All right, yeah.

00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:28.840
Well, when you go, um, it wasn't the new road then, because I wouldn't have been able to

00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:29.760
go on the new road anyway.

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:30.320
Yeah.

00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:30.480


00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:33.680
No, you wouldn't be able to go on the motorway, uh, you know, with a tractor.

00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:33.920
Yeah.

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:35.400
It wasn't the same then.

00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:40.940
Um, and, uh, I used to go down past the Holston Jockey on the bottom, and I used to go down

00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:42.160
the hill and knock it out of gear.

00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:42.640
Yeah.

00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:44.220
And I'd go down that hill like the crappers.

00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:47.800
And I often think, well, what if something came across the road?

00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:49.380
I wouldn't have a chance.

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:49.920
Oh, my goodness.

00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:51.760
You do things when you're young, don't you?

00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:52.200
Yeah.

00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:55.920
Yeah, I did three journeys, that.

00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:59.420
I brought the plough up, and I brought a big trailer up with implements on.

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:03.480
And, uh, yes, it took me four and a half hours to come down.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:04.340
And were you the only child?

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:04.920
Yes.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:05.500
Ah.

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:06.920
I haven't even got a cousin.

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:08.020
Really?

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:08.440
No.

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.140
But my, my two aunts didn't marry.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:11.960
My one aunt did marry.

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:12.960
We didn't have no family.

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:15.840
And then my, my, um, uncle, he married.

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:16.200
He didn't marry.
