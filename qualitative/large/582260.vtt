00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
And many of the children there at that time didn't go out at all.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.260
They were never left the hospital premises.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.720
So one of the things she did was to take them to the swimming pool at Guildford Crescent.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.700
And this is gone now.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.960
It's a Chinese restaurant or hotel or something now.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.400
But she used to take them once a week down to the and that was the first time many of them had ever been out.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.420
And it was a struggle to do because she used to have to go on the bus with the children.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.900
And I used to go with her and used to come back on the bus.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.980
And people in the public were sometimes quite...

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.900
I wouldn't say they were rude, but it was like as if they had never seen...

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.120
They hadn't seen people with learning disabilities out in the way that they were out with my mother.
