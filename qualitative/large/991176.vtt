00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
Community House was run by the Christian church to start with.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.860
It isn't any longer, but it was.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.000
And so the boys in the Asian Youth Club were coming into a Christian environment.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.720
Now, was this a problem?

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.740
Was it seen as a problem by the boys or by you?

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.860
I think, I mean, I'm not looking to be boastful here,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.240
but I think Eton Road and Community House at the time were quite lucky

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.600
that they were working with people who had a legitimacy in the community.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.460
They were people who were respected in their communities.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.100
People like Monis Maflahi, myself, we had a lot to do with the local mosque in Harrow Road.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.200
Monis had a lot to do with the mosque in Alexander Road in Pell.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.040
We had a young lad from Landwine Street, one of the local Pakistani lads,

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.740
who was very well respected, a very good footballer, and a Bangladeshi lad.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.220
So we had...

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.900
We had a range of people from different areas, different skills, different knowledge,

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.220
and who could relate to the young people.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:12.580
So we almost acted as a bridge between Community House and, in inverted commas,

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.180
the church in the background, and the wider Muslim community in the area.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:26.820
I think we looked at the building and we saw, we realised there was a church element

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.800
to the building, but we always saw it, we always saw the community part of the building

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.180
as the greater part of the building.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.620
Now, I don't know why we did that.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.500
There was nobody ever said to us, well, this is a community centre more than it's a church.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:51.260
But for some reason, we just kind of imagined it so, and we were happy to go along with that.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.140
But I think more important than the building and the church was the people,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.780
who...

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.860
who came into the building, the young people.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.940
We as workers, people like Brian, other people who were involved with the building.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.880
And it was the people who kind of acted as, you know, the bridge and...

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.040
made contact with other people and spoke to other people.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.560
So I think the role of the building was secondary.
