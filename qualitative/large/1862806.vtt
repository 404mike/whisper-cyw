Welcome to Mouth Off, a podcast brought to you by Forget Me Not Productions.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:12.500
My name is Clary Sadler, and on today's episode, I'm going to be talking about the I Plus Matter

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.200
Project, which is a heritage lottery funded project conceived by T. Gwynne Special School

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.960
in Cardiff and inclusive arts organization, Forget Me Not Productions. I Plus Matter

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:33.540
provided multiple opportunities for meaningful assistive technology experiences. These were

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.560
interwoven with the arts and music was used as a motivator to enable individuals with the most

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:48.360
complex physical and cognitive disabilities to share their own history and celebrate their

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.740
independent achievements. The project was launched in February 2020 and was due to conclude in July

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.940
of this year. I Plus Matter is a project that is being developed by the I Plus Matter Foundation

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:03.360
We were going to have a training event called I Plus Matter Festival, and it was going to involve

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.340
professionals in the field of special education and social and health sectors. It was also going

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.740
to be a celebration of the achievements of all involved. The participants would use a range of

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:24.780
assistive technology such as eye gaze, switches and touch monitors in order to help them achieve

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.940
an individual's life. I Plus Matter was a project that was going to be a celebration of the achievements

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.940


00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:26.380
of all involved. The participants were going to be a celebration of the achievements of all involved. The

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.380


00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:34.660
independently take part in music and arts sessions. Due to COVID-19, the project was postponed and we

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.960
had to adapt the sharing event and the training event to fit a virtual platform. Pupils at five

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.300
local special schools, adults from a local day center, and three individuals all with complex

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:54.540
needs took part in assistive technology and inclusive arts sessions called Music Can. Music

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.920
Can is a program that was launched in the early 2000s to help people with disabilities and

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.220
gifted children. Music Can is primarily a move that other people can take the time to share. It

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.540
uses a persuasive einzige Africa kind of musical musical protocol developed by Forget-Me-Not

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.100
production and it uses music primarily as a motivator to engage individuals with the most

We had all worked with Forget-Me-Not produc remont reduce history its Arenas are

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:34.340
to face Music Can sessions had resumed by the end of 2021, but sadly due to ongoing COVID-19

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.000
restrictions, Trinity Field Special School had to pull out. Luckily, Asghar Henvelin Special School

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.940
stepped in and had the remaining sessions, enabling us to wrap up the project. So what exactly do we

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.040
mean by assistive technology? Well, for the purpose of this project, we're using the term

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.440
assistive technology to include any specialist technology that enables access to a computer.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:08.900
So things such as switches, touch monitors, eye gaze, which is a computer that is operated by eye

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.700
movements, and these are linked to specialist software for teaching cause and effect, choice

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.780
making and beyond, augmentative and alternative communication, or AAC, specialist controls for

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.700
wheelchair driving, and access.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:33.220
So when eye gaze first became commercially available, it was really mostly suited for

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.400
people who were already at a level of using AAC, and perhaps were using AAC with switches,

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.580
switches being very effective, but slow, slow and laborious.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.240
Another focus of iPlus Matter has been to provide staff members with the opportunities to be trained

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.020
in the implementation of assistive technology systems.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:01.060
For those with the most complex disabilities. Why do you think projects such as this iPlus Matter

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.580
funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund are so important for the individuals that have been

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.060
taking part from your school?

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.980
When they say assistive technology, like we did have eye gaze, case machines here, but they were,

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.980
they've become old and they've been broken and they're obsolete. So it's only now that we've

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.120
started to use the eye gaze because we've followed the term that your project has brought them in,

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.020
and we use it to help people with disabilities. So it's only now that we've started to use the eye gaze, because we've followed the term your project has brought them in, and we use it to help people with disabilities.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:32.080
using one parent to set an eye gaze in. So we're trying to re-establish those, and also we want to start training the staff,

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.500
and really to see what opportunities we can use with the eye gaze. It's wonderful with your project,

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.920
because you can see how well the children have responded to it, and how much you really need that in our school.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.560
What have been the main benefits that you've seen from the individuals that have taken part in the project?

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.660
So to see how much they've progressed in the two weeks.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.420
It's been amazing. I think it's fantastic.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.540
When they get to experience technology, and staff get to see what they're capable of by using that technology,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.700
which gives us input as well to move forward with purchasing of ourselves and developing those skills.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.820
And pupils get to be able to be part of a project.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.020
Parents can share and see that project and see what their children are working on.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:23.520
And I know the way that our pupils have responded. They've been focused and they've really enjoyed it.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.600
And I think music is such a wonderful access for our pupils anyway.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:34.980
So it's just a wonderful way for them to be focused and to be able to get into that niche, and they are there.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.900
Absolutely.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:43.920
What are the main barriers for these individuals achieving independently within a school or daycare setting?

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:52.740
The challenge is they need more consistency, and they need more technology things to come in for the children.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.180
And that's why we've had them focus higher than where they already are.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:05.960
One of the main aims of the project has been to empower individuals identified as experiencing profound and multiple learning disabilities,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.560
or individuals that have complex physical disabilities.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.880
These individuals use assistive technology to experience independent achievement.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.480
And throughout the project we use the Music Can framework to motivate engagement with this technology.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:29.540
Changing and shifting the focus from disability to ability.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.100
When I started making music with Forget Me Not Productions, it changed my life. Music transformed me.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:48.820
We hope to raise awareness also of the historical development of assistive technologies and the potential impact for independent learning via new technologies and new techniques.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.460
We speak to Mel Sadler about the history of assistive technology.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.460


00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.460


00:06:53.480 --> 00:07:06.340
But of course, by far, the biggest development for assistive technology, particularly for those individuals with the greatest cognitive impairments, has been the development of eye gaze.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.100
So eye gaze worked really well for that group of people straight away.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:22.860
But it took some time for eye gaze to be suited for software to come out and be made available for people with more significant intellectual impairments, as well as their physical disability.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:23.460
But we've made it available for people with more significant intellectual impairments, as well as their physical disability.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:33.740
So once software such as Look2Learn and SensoryEyeFX and some of the inclusive technology softwares became available for eye gaze users,

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:39.520
it's really opened up a whole new world for that group of learners, which is just amazing.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:51.400
And you see people making choices using eye gaze who I would have considered it being very difficult to teach them to make choices using switches,

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:57.320
because using switches to make choices is a much higher cognitive load, if that makes sense.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.700
Yet they can do it with eye gaze.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:07.200
We also talked to assistive technology guru, Carol Thornett.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:13.140
Dr. Carol Thornett has been involved in the field of assistive technology since 1986.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:21.380
She was a pioneer in exploring the use of assistive technology with individuals experiencing profound and multiple learning disabilities.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:29.460
In fact, it was Carol that developed the first mobility platform, which was originally part of the Spastic Society research project,

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:36.700
and had the aim of enabling children with cerebral palsy to explore mobility when their peers were able to.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:42.440
With mobility, we tried to get children mobile at the same age that their peers would be mobile.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:49.880
So it's been extrapolated to those with learning difficulties and physical difficulties, obviously, as well.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.980
But initially, it was just a physical difficulty.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.500
That proved to be really exciting.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:02.100
And I think it's quite sad now that I see so few with independent mobility.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:11.380
They should be in their usual seating, because that was always such a problem if they went to a wheelchair service,

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.800
in that, you know, what seating would they use?

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.800
So this was, you know, that's the reason why it was a platform.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:27.100
You could attach the whole seating system so that you started by looking at whether they could control it,

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:32.740
and what they would do, and, you know, if they stopped, they stopped, and this is as important as going, and so on.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:38.720
The historic Criger Park School has also been our heritage partner throughout the I Plus Matter sessions.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.720
Criger Park House is a country house in Pentirk, Cardiff.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:47.660
It was built in 1914 for a colliery owner named Thomas Evans.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:54.540
Evans died in 1943, and Criger Park then came into the possession of the National Coal Board

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.260
before being sold in 1954 to the Spastic Society.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:06.860
They opened a residential school site in 1955, and the house still operates as a residential care facility today.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:14.220
It is also a special school for young adults with learning disabilities, which is operated by Salutum Healthcare.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.640
The school I work in is cared for by people with disabilities.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:24.840
Research the school you're going to work in, and the students you're going to work with,

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:31.420
and then it's just a case of getting to know your colleagues, and them getting to know you,

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.000
and that should make your job hopefully a lot easier.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:44.360
That was one of the first things people used to look at and say.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.620
Last time, probably a C-2.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:53.060
I was a student, but that doesn't happen anymore because I'm older and I grow beards and stuff like that.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.560
So that tends not to happen anymore.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:02.720
Well, my powered wheelchair, it can, well, the batteries last longer,

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:10.820
which means I can stay out for longer, I can socialise for longer, and be at work for longer.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.540
And secondly, my power chair then can also,

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:22.440
so as you can see the chair, the chair that I'm sitting in is actually rising,

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:27.020
which then also helps me in my job professionally,

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.620
when I'm working with students with standing frames,

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.000
Warren standing frames, sorry,

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:39.500
and also helps me socially when there is no seating available for other people,

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:44.380
I can then rise myself up to the level that the person is standing to.

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.720
And then when I'm done,

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.940
you just go back down.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.180
So it's basically far different now to how it used to be.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:12:00.740
There's no comparison because now I can turn lights on using my voice.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.640
Whereas when I was younger,

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:12.480
I wasn't able, well, I wasn't able to really reach the light switches

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.900
due to them being on a different level.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:22.760
What would you say you're most proud of something you've achieved,

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:28.440
maybe through your use of technology that's helped you achieve that thing?

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.240
It could be related to school or it could be...

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:33.860
Games.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.640
Games?

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.660
And remote control, controls.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.540
So you're quite the expert.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.760
I'm quite the expert when it comes to games and remote control.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:49.920
Yes.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.980
I need help trying out accessible instruments.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.280
I need help accessing music tech in recording studios.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.520
This is what we're doing through us really, isn't it?

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.400
I guess remotely in the house.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.940
When I started making music with Forget Me Not Productions,

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.180
it changed my life.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.420
Music transformed me.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.480
I feel like I'm finally using my brain properly.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:19.800
Join me next time when I interview Yvonne Kinnicky.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:25.200
Yvonne is a programmer and curator specializing in black independent film.
