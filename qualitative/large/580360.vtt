00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640
I worked on an elderly ward, so that was about 30 beds, males with dementia.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.920
And that had a Florence, like the Nightingale ward, so you could see everybody there.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:22.360
And you'd have, I worked mainly nights there, so there'd be two staff one night, 30 patients.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.920
It was hard work, but I think, I don't know whether there was a use, you know,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.740
it was okay, it was okay.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.820
It was very regimented, you know, you knew who was doing what at a certain time.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.860
And then we used to have to mop the floors.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.980
And I just remember in this ward, cockroaches.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.080
I mean, I remember watching a panorama programme a few years later

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.600
and seeing that these were big cockroaches.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.080
There were big cockroaches there.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.640
And, you know, so we used to have to mop the floor.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.880
And if you'd put the light on in certain areas, you could hear them, you know.
