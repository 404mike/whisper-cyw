00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.680
I mean they left Odessa in about 1903 as a result of her eldest sister witnessing

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.000
the beheading of her husband. It was a wretched scenario.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.840
Can you say more about that?

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.280
I will because it was part of my life as a child.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:31.200
Aunt Bella, who was a very, very beautiful woman, I've seen photographs of her as a young

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:39.300
woman and she was strikingly beautiful, had married a Cossack, a non-Jew, who was apparently

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.280
also, in fact I've got some photographs of their offspring in that book which you will

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.860
see later.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:53.260
And the Cossacks did not want their people to be killed.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.900
To marry Jews.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:02.380
So to make an example, he was beheaded in their cellar in front of her when she was

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.800
carrying Grisha, who was then about five months pregnant, she was, and she graphically told

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.220
me the story of how she spoke with a very Russian accent.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:23.060
They held his head and he had long beautiful hair, and they had a huge scimitar and whoosh,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.640
and the head came off and the blood went up to the ceiling all over me, I was carrying

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.080
Grisha.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.880
Little, little ladle sitting on her lap, aged about five, heard this story so many

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.320
times I got used to it.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.860
It was quite something.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.180
I think this was the final straw which said, get the hell out.
