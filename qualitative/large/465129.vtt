00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
The two devolution campaigns, the first in 79, the second in 97,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.460
did you follow those debates on television?

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.240
I followed them as best I could.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.980
But, to be quite honest, I had very little interest in the first one.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.900
I didn't think we were ready for it, and so it turned out.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.180
It was an almighty defeat.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.400
I think the majority of the Welsh people felt like I did,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.720
that perhaps the time wasn't ripe.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.140
And it was in 1979, wasn't it?

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.560
Callaghan's government.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.800
Well, he was ready to go anyway, everybody knew that.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.440
So I thought, I think there was a bit of a backlash in that,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.400
with unemployment being quite high,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.520
and his government likely to be kicked out if they hadn't already been.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.120
I can't remember what month of the year it was. When was it?

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.880
It was March, wasn't it?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.220
He was definitely in power then, wasn't he?

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.980
Because the election wasn't until...

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.720
I think it was a bit later with Margaret Thatcher.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:09.860
And I think it was a backlash because his government had sort of pushed the idea,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.400
or presented the idea, offered it.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.400
Most Welsh people decided, no, we're not doing it.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.940
But, of course, when it came to 97, there was a different proposition altogether by then,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.900
because in the meantime, television had played their part in a big way.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.720
There'd been a...

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:28.900
Margaret Thatcher...

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.480
had...

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.760
united Wales in a sense,

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.720
for the wrong reasons perhaps, but united it nevertheless.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.160
And therefore there was a growing feeling that perhaps Wales would be better off on their own,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.760
without the...

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.940
I mean, we've had to suffer the English for the last 800 years, haven't we?

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.820
And I like your...

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.700
If they get a no vote today, it'll carry on for a few... much longer, you know?

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.320
Are you able to get home and vote, or what?

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.760
Yes.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.100
You are?

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.440
Yeah.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.100
Oh, it's open till 10, isn't it?

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.300
Open till 10, yeah.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.940
That's right.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.500
Yeah, you've got to go down later.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.880
No, the... I think the...

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.880
And I mean...

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.520
In 97, they only just scraped through, didn't they?

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.740
50% to... 50% point... 50 point something to 49 point something.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.860
And it's strange really, because...

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.620
Wales has always been a radical country.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.200
A country of radicals, if you like.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.960
The Chartist Movement, and Quakers, non-conformists, Wesleyans, Methodists, and so forth.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.800
I mean, I'm Annie Bunwir.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.700
My father was a Wesleyan Methodist.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.640
My mother was a Baptist.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.780
Lots of my friends were Quakers.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.440
I mean, America's built on Quakerism, a lot of it.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.280
It started off...

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.260
The Mormons were...

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.600
...in the same type.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.900
From the same ilk.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:06.460
a lot of Welsh people were moaned. So I think we were ready for some change and I think

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.900
I can't see that the Welsh Assembly has done any harm to the economy, it's done a lot of good.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.580
I see Scotland are following Wales now with free prescriptions.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.760
So they must have done something right. There's always the feeling amongst the Welsh,

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.760
amongst the working class, that MPs who've never done a decent day's work in their lives,

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.520
I'm quoting other people now, are all for what they can get out of it themselves. Well,

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.240
that's unfortunate but it's because of the MP expenses which TV highlighted as well as the

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:49.880
newspapers that has caused people to be angry about things. So as soon as people nowadays like

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.880
the Welsh Assembly ministers

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.900
put forward an idea, Welsh in particular, they go, what's he saying that for? What are they going

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.320
to get out of it? And that's why people are worried, like my wife, what's it going to cost us

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:14.980
if they get a yes vote? But at the same time, is it right that what we want to do in Wales

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.300
should be governed by people in England?

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.140
What was

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.800
the idea?

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:31.220
Oh yeah, Trewerin. Because I can remember Trewerin and Capil Kelyn getting drowned.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:41.040
And at the time it was evident that all 40-odd Welsh MPs had voted against it

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.560
and they were outvoted by their English counterparts because they were in the majority.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.560
I mean what sort of a democracy was that sort of thing, you know?

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.660
When Liverpool could have got

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:00.900
their water from Cumbria, the wettest part of the United Kingdom, apart from Wales, and

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:09.760
the irony of it was that once they'd flooded Capil Kelyn to create Trewerin,

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.920
there were houses overlooking the reservoir who couldn't get water because Liverpool wouldn't

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:23.400
give supply pipe water to them. And oh my god, you know, if we could cast ourselves adrift,

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.720
and float away like Ireland, have a river between us or water between us, we'd be better off I think.
