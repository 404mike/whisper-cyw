00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.720
One interview with Mrs. Avis Williams of Edmonton.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:19.280
You were asking about the Welsh language. Now this is very interesting, Glennis, because it goes back to the very beginning of what I said about the Welsh church here.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:36.000
This has been a very integral part of the keeping of the Welsh culture of the language, particularly possibly for my sister's generation and mine.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:49.100
It was completely Welsh service, of course, and they carried out the format of the service much as they do in the Welsh chapels in Wales.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.260
Yes.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:01:06.080
And we simply had to go in front during the service, as many of the children did, to recite Welsh verses or verses of hymns, biblical verses I was referring to first of all.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:15.340
And that, I think, is where we got our real grounding of the pronunciation and, well, and the understanding of it.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.260
And though my parents were as Welsh as anyone who ever spoke Welsh, they were very much Welsh.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.260


00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:28.060
My father came out of Wales. My father was Mr. T. Morris Hughes from Mould in Flintshire, and our mother was from Rytton.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:37.100
And they spoke every word of Welsh in the house, but somehow didn't carry on the conversation with Stella and myself.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:47.400
And we often mentioned it to them in later years. Mama used to say, well, you had your grounding in the Welsh verses,

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.260
and the way you memorized them.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.680
And it's really rather difficult to understand why they didn't keep it up.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.900
We understand practically every word.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:07.220
And then, of course, I was very fortunate to marry Len, who is from Anglesey, from Llanfodog, Anglesey.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.480
And to this day, I tease him that he thinks in Welsh and speaks in English.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.240
And though we don't converse, he has never spoken English.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.540
He never lost his Welsh.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.540
As a matter of fact, 16 years ago, we went back to Wales, and he spoke as fluent Welsh as he did.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.920
At that time, he'd been out here 35 years and simply thrilled everybody.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.820
So, of course, he kept my Welsh up.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.940
I used to do a little bit of singing, and of course he did too.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.420
And our son, Glyn, learned his Welsh hymn, which he sang.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:59.860
As guest soloist in San Francisco National Gamamba there, through coaching by his father, Len, of course.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:07.660
So we have been very fortunate in being able to keep the, to a certain extent, the understanding.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.940
But I'm not very fluent in the actual conversational Welsh.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.040
Would you like to say just a few words in Welsh to finish?

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.740
Well, I rather stunned my listeners occasionally.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:36.940
As a matter of fact, not too long ago, I was describing Anglesey and mentioning about the littlest town there with the largest name.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.540
Llanfair pul Gwyngill, gogeroch wyr yn drobul Llandysillog o Goch.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.220
And I often play the record of the Welsh language.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.480
I play the Roos male voice choir.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:04:02.260
And I'm always tempted, which I practically always do, tell them that they're, it's all right to say they're from Roos.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.720
But for those who know better, they come from Roos Llanfair wyr gog.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.840
And believe it or not, I found that really more of a problem than Llanfair pul Gwyngill.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.860
But, oh, I don't know.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.200
I think it's a little bit of a mystery.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.700
I think possibly I'll carry on this program.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:22.640
It is unique.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.980
As far as I know, I don't think there is another Welsh program in North America.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.920
I have never heard of any in the States.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.440
And I'm quite sure there isn't another one in Canada.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.060
If there is, I would most certainly like to hear of it.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.020
But CKUA is rather a unique station.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:05:02.040
It is non-commercial and just is centered around ethnic groups and has been a great help to the Welsh community of Edmonton.
