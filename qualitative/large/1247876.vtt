WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.820
originally I did but

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:03.080
after so many

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.240
mishaps I've had

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:04.580
oh

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:05.880
you know what

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.900
love at first sight

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.040
can go sling one

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.700
I do believe in

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.480
love at first sight

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.380
just because of

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.740
love is another part

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.700
of like either friendship

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.180
or

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.620
relationship as well

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.380
that

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.880
it can bring

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.140
a positive outcome

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.640
in someone

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.080
and they kind of

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.680
you can kind of

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.320
help them to

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.000
be loved

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.880
and be secure

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.540
and comfort

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.620
probably you can do that

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.440
in friendship as well

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.740
but in a different

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.800
manner but

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.260
love can be either

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.040
relationship or

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.040
be a family member

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.000
or something or

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.280
and

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.220
I think

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.060
it was hard for me

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.420
when I was younger

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.640
because

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.300
I probably didn't believe it

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.700
at first sight

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.080
when I was younger

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.700
but as you get older

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.200
you do because

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.220
you kind of feel more

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.920
as part of life then

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.340
I think you realise

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.360
that you need someone

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.960
in your life probably

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.980
to feel that way

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:07.860
but I think

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.500
I don't know

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.900
I thought I felt love

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.380
at first sight

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.080
I would say

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.940
probably about

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.260
a few years ago

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.420
when I started my college

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.240
because that's why

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.640
why I want

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.200
you know college

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.920
was perfect for me

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.640
because I knew that

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.460
getting a girlfriend

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.980
today is quite

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.020
half and half

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.900
but I had a couple

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.700
of girlfriends in there

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.780
but it was just

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.040
they lived quite far away

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.340
but

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.640
yeah

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.200
I don't know

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.200


00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.200


00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.200


00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.200


00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.200


00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.200


00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.200


00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.200


00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.200


00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.200


00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.260
I think

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.260


00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.500
finding

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.120
you know

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.100
finding love as well

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.700
at first sight

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.820
it's hard

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.100
well it is

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.300
like

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.680
I generally thought

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.940
love at first sight

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.340
was it

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.340
when I was going

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.340
through primary school

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.340
up into comp

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.980
and all that

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.520
then into college

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.040
yeah

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.840
and of course

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.620
I was kind of

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.640
I've been in

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.900
about

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.600
six maybe

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.060
seven

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.000
relationships

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.800
in total

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.580
but the one that

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.840
I don't think you met

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.000
or you might have

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.180
was

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.100
Jack

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.100
yes

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.340
yes

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.860
that was a couple

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.160
years ago

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.460
yeah

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.400
that's when I was

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.820
living with her

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.560
for seven months

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.760
yeah

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.720
that's when I generally

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.420
thought it was love

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.080
at first sight

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.380
yeah

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.500
I know

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.380
and

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.600
as we've said

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.580
it's hard when

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.640
you're happy

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.260
and then something

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.100
bad happens to you

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.500
that you think

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.660
yeah

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.520
am I doing anything

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.080
right or wrong

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.760
I know

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.680
and they won't

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.160
even tell you

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.540
yeah

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.380
and I think

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.960
that's

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.980
I think

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.160
I'm lucky with mine

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.400
I

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.180
you know

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.820
when I

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.040
seen Kimmy

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.340
and Ponty

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.780
bus station

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.140
back

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.100
January 2017

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.100
I

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.660
well

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.680
I looked at her

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.400
but she kind of

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.960
looked down

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.500
because I think

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.420
she probably felt the same

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.220
love at first sight

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.800
we kind of knew

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.480
there was something there

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.120
so I think

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.580
that's why

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.940
we're still together now

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:41.860
I think

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.440
my first reaction was

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.620
and they call it

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.420
puppy love

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.320
yeah

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.920
yeah

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.080
and I think

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.680
you know

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.240
some of the people

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.560
are lucky

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.880
when you

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.920
have someone

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.420
you know

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.780
love

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.580
and

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.800
you see them first

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.740
you think

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.940
right

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:01.420
is that

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.980
you know

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.440
that's definitely

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.800
the girl

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.520
and that

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.780
yeah

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.400
I think

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.840
sometimes you

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.280
you know

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.120
part of life

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.580
that you might not

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.880
be lucky

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.380
you might be

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.640
you just

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.000
gotta think

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.340
positive

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.820
and just say

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.820
hey let's go for it

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.460
and if not

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.980
it don't work out

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.220
you know

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.440
yeah

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.820
because there's

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.380
plenty more fish

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.860
in the sea

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.400
as they say

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.520
yeah

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.460
but

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.640
love

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.040
is not

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.640
you know

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.540
a very powerful

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.900
source

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.280
I think

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.040
yeah

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.580
you know

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.820
for you

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.080
I think

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.360
I think

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.560
it's a good

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.060
you know

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.240
come and go

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.520
for you

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.000
but I think

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.280
it's

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.200
I think it's

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.560
hard for you

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.000
because of

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.660
who you are

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.320
to believe

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.620
in it

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.820
and

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.240
you know

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.540
just like

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.100
so I think

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.720
I believe

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.440
it is

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.480
I thought

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.020
at one point

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.000
I grasped it

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.200
and then

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.780
out of the blue

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.260
and I was just

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.520
like

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.120
nah

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.820
I haven't grasped it

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.860
still gotta do

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.440
a few tweaks

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.200
year in May

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.060
but

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.120
I have been

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.000
doing those tweaks

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.540
yeah

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.920
but

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.660
yeah

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.280
just don't work

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.660
as much

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.460
as I was

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.540
without the tweaks
