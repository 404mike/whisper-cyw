WEBVTT

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:14.340
Yes, there, we're ready to go now. Today is Friday the 23rd of September. My name is Jill

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:22.280
Willey and I'm at Habit Hardware talking to Mr. John Jones who has lived in this area all his

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:28.980
life. John, thank you very much for agreeing to have a chat with me. First of all, could we just

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.560
start with your year of birth, John, please? I was born on the 2nd of February 1948. And can you

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:44.420
tell me where you were born? I was born in a bedroom at Upper Llanfadog. Llanfadog. Can you

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:51.580
tell me exactly where Upper Llanfadog or Llanfadog Ichaf is then, John? Well, as you go from Raida

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:58.560
up the Ellon Valley, you go past the Ellon Valley Hotel and it's the next farm on your

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.900
right.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:07.420
About 300 yards away. Thank you. And what sort of facilities do you remember as you were growing

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.360
up? Things like running water and etc. Can you give me some details of that sort of thing?

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:24.540
Well, we had no electricity. The toilet was outside about 50 yards away. And the water we

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.800
had from the spout. And my mother did all the washing and that.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:38.740
And the water was out there by the brook. And bathing was a tin bath brought into the back kitchenolution.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.420
Perhaps twice a week. Sometimes only once a week. And no electricity. So we had these

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:58.960
paraffin lamps that you had to pump up all the time when the pressure dropped. I see. And how did you get to the

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.040
farm? How much work did you yourself do around the farm, John, as a young boy growing up?

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:14.440
I did quite a bit. When I attended Ellon Village School, I used to milk a cow every morning

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.900
by hand because we saw milk round the Ellon Village, and that was my contribution. I milked

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.600
this one cow who was my favourite, perched on a little stool.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.060
and then I walked to the school afterwards.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.440
And you actually got your water from where exactly, John?

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.660
Well, between the house and building at Llanfadog, there was a brook coming down

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.740
and we had a spout and a little pool there and that is where the water came from.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:57.080
But when I was about 10, we had it piped about 500 yards from another well out in the field

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:05.580
and that was wonderful spring water and the only time I saw that go dry was in the hot summer of 1976.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:15.460
Indeed. And were your family born at and grew up in Llanfadog, Upper?

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.000
My father was born there.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.720
Oh.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.460
And my mother was born at the convent, Llania.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.140
Now, were you a large family, John, in Llanfadog?

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:37.760
Yes, we were. I was the fourth, but there was a baby loss between me and the sister above me.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:47.780
So we were five, really. And so there was five of us, but I was born a long time after.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.700
My two older sisters were 22 and 20 when I was born.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:02.440
And two of my three sisters were married with children, so I have nephews and nieces older than myself.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.780
That's quite unusual, but of course it does happen.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.240
What sort of major events can you remember in the Elland Valley as you were growing up, John?

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:24.020
Well, I suppose the first one was when the Queen came with the Duke of Edinburgh in October 1952.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:35.840
I would have been four years old. And I just remember standing outside the hotel over on where the bicycle path is now with our flags.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.640
And my sister Joan was a waitress in the Elland Valley and she waited on the Queen.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.040
Oh, what an accolade, my word.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:54.500
And what places did you have to play in and to generally just explore in your Elland Valley area?

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.060
On a farm. You had plenty of places. You had fields all round you.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.640
But I think me and my nephews enjoyed going down the brook to where it meets the River Elland.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:12.060
And we were catching minnows there until I was old enough to have a rod and line.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.500
And I loved fishing in those days.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.760
Quite a lot of that goes on at the Elland Valley, doesn't it?

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:26.280
Right, now what memories do you have of the big shearings that took place in the Elland Valley, John?

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.140
Oh, well, it was the highlight of the year.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.460
Like, you swapped men with neighbouring farms.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.620
So, you know, there might be 30 men would come to your shearing.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.600
And it was the day of the year.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.600
Like, and...

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:51.940
You started off with breakfast and then you had lunch and tea and hopefully you finished about 5 o'clock.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.000
And we had one hill which was up above the Clirwin Dam.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:05.000
So them sheep had to be driven down on a two-day drive sort of thing to share at Uppal and Vaddog.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:12.980
And then that night they were taken back up to the Hen Run and they went on from there back to their hill next day.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.140
And shearing was a wonderful thing.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:23.540
As a boy, the highlight was after dinner we'd have a game of football with all the younger men.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:32.740
But what I remember, there was four or five old men sat outside the barn on a bench all day.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:38.340
And all they were sitting down and talking about tails.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.660
And they seemed very old to me.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.960
But when I think back, they were probably...

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.540
Only in their late 60s, you know.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.560
But the way they dressed and that, I thought they were 100.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.940
But I'm sure they had lots of interesting memories to share.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.440
Yes.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:03.540
So would you say that despite the rural locality, you had plenty to do and a very good social life, you knew everyone?

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.100
Oh yes, I knew everyone.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.360
And as I'd got two nephews living behind the Elland Valley Hotel,

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:20.300
the three of us sort of played together most nights and played football in the field at Llanfadog.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:29.840
And later on, when the Birmingham City police cadets came to Elland Village, they had goalposts put up on the green.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.560
So we used to go up there to play football.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:38.600
And I've seen us cycle down to Llanowthal to play Boys of Llanowthal.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.880
And everywhere we went, we cycled.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:51.340
And I was a founder member of Raider Young Farmers, and that started in 1963.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:57.100
And till we were old enough to drive, we went there on a pushbike.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.920
Which was up in Bryn Tyrian then. They held the meetings.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:09.360
And Bryn Tyrian, I understand, is the then secondary school of the area. Is that correct?

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:09.680
Yes, it was.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.780
The only time I ever attended...

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.140
Bryn Tyrian was to try my 11 plus.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:23.320
Right. We'll come on to that now then, on to school life.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:29.380
Can you tell me where you went to school and what age you were when you started, John?

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:36.640
I went to Elland Village Primary School at East 1953.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.080
My birthday was February.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:42.680
So I'd...

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:42.760
I'd been there for a year.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.020
I'd just gone five.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:48.120
And my sister Joan took me to school the first morning.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:55.200
And all the other pupils were stood in the entrance, I think, waiting the newcomer.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.580
And I was there till 1959.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:05.120
And I had many a happy time looking back in the Valley School.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.500
We were never more than 20 pupils.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.560
And I think when I left, they were down to 12.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.300
And there was two teachers there.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:20.620
The first teacher was Mrs. Jim Price, or Mrs. Betty Price.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.500
And the senior teacher was Miss Chew.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.520
I have heard those names.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:30.500
Right.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.440
Could I add one more thing?

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:32.900
Please.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:42.260
The only thing I hated about the Elland Valley School, every June, the Lord Mayor of Birmingham came down.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.040
And we had the June Tea.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.560
And, of course, the tea was nice.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.720
I loved that.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.800
But afterwards, we had to perform on stage.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.320
And every year, they seemed to have me to sing a solo.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:01.820
And after that, the Lady Mayoress presented us all with a book for what we'd done during the year.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.200
If you'd done well, you had the best books.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:07.740
Right.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.240
And am I right in thinking that the school at the Elland Valley School,

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.140
the Elland Village, was where the lodge is now?

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.160
Yes, it was.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:24.560
There was a school immediately above it when the works were going on.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.080
But this new school was built in 1909.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.180
And my mother went to the old school just above it.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.240
But my father was not allowed to go to that school

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.220
because he was living in the Radnish Ascent.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.360
And he had to walk three miles to come to the school every day.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:52.460
So you yourself went to the Elland Village School,

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:56.060
but you were still in what was then Radnish, weren't you?

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:01.960
So were there many other children from Radnish in that school?

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.400
No.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.180
I think at the time I left, there was just two of us.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.420
The other boy didn't try the 11 plus.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.220
So he went straight to the 11 plus.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.200
He went straight to Brynturion.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.700
There was three the same age as me living on the Breckinshire side.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.560
So they went to BILF High School.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.480
And they didn't have to try the 11 plus.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:29.160
I was the only one out of the five of us that had to try the 11 plus.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.040
And was that because Radnish and Breckinshire,

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.240
being different authorities,

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:37.300
had decided different rules regarding the 11 plus?

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:38.980
Yes, it had.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.200
I mean, it's different now.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.520
You can go to any school.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.080
But in them days it was Radnish and Breckinshire.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.960
And I only lived 200 yards from the River Elland.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.820
And if I'd been the other side, I'd have been in Breckinshire.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.800
And would not have had to take the 11 plus, I see.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.280
Now having taken the 11 plus, what school did you then go to, John?

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:07.260
I went to Lander and Dudd Grammar School in the first week of September 1959,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:13.380
when a school car driven by Mr Harold Ashton

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.640
from the shop down opposite Jimmy Lloyd's yard

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.200
drove me down to the bus.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:24.740
And then we met the bus up by the Smithfield in Raider.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.020
And there was a boys' bus and a girls' bus.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:33.580
And how long were you at that school, travelling to and from then, John?

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.240
Well, I left in...

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:43.960
1963, because I'd had a couple of run-ins with Mr Harold's headmaster.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.580
And he said that I had to try my O levels.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.020
And I said, I'll show you.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.160
And I left.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.420
You left. Right.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:01.680
Well, John, you must have seen quite a lot of changes in the valley.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.940
Would you like to talk a little bit about the development of the valley as you know it?

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.180
Well, I've seen lots of changes.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.460
Not for the better, in my opinion.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.800
I, you know, although I'm a proud Welshman,

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.720
Birmingham were very good landlords.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.880
And they were good to the farmers.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:28.320
And they would provide new gates and hurdles and fencing material every year.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.580
And then when it changed over to Welsh Water,

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.740
it was a downward spiral.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:41.680
And I think the valley was much better in those days.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.000
Much tidier.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.440
You could fish from the Cabin Dam to Garrick Dee.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.480
That railway line had two or three sheep in it.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.400
And it kept all the foliage down.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.420
Now it's just like a jungle.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.920
And you can't fish one yard of it.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:59.460
Very, very unfortunate.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:04.720
Because fishing is really quite a prominent activity in our area, isn't it?

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.580
Yes.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.800
Speaking about the livestock now,

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:14.240
how often did you actually come into Raida to the market or to any other market?

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:16.880
Well, I don't remember coming much.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:24.600
My father, you know, would bring a cow or cow and calf or something occasionally to the mart.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:29.180
And we'd always sell our sale ewes in the autumn.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:33.480
And we drove them down with two dogs.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:38.140
And I sometimes walked in front and my father behind.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.900
And we never lost one.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.080
We always got them to the market and tied the dogs up there all day and sold.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:54.060
And one year the prices were poor, so we didn't sell.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.260
I was about 16 at the time.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.100
Anyway, my father was getting on then.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.460
And a car stopped when we were driving down.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.160
And he was driving his sheep home.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.180
And he offered father a lift home.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.540
And he said, I'll leave my dog with you.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:15.580
And soon as father got in the car, the dog went back towards Raida.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.860
And unfortunately, he got killed by a car.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.940
And I got the sheep home with my dog.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:29.420
And then my sister Joan went back to Raida in the van to look for this dog

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.180
and found him dead on the road and brought him back.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:33.740
And that's what happened.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:33.820
And I'm so sad.

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.340
How unfortunate.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.960
One that I'm sure...

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.600
And we took the sheep to the next fair and didn't do any better.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.540
So we may as well have sold them on the first fair.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.440
All memories, of course, Joan, aren't they?

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:48.920
Yes.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.640
Now, if we could come back to the school.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:57.180
I believe you had some relatives that actually taught at that school, John.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.500
Can you tell us a little bit about that, please?

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.320
Well, they didn't teach at that school.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:07.680
They taught at the old school up the cabin, which is now under the water.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.540
I think they moved here in 1891.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:19.960
Elizabeth Ably and her sister Alice Anne Ably, who became my grandmother.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.620
She married Evan Jones from Upperland Paddock.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:31.840
And they were brought here to teach English because they knew that the dams was coming.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:37.500
And there was a lot of English and Irish and Scots people moving into the area.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:42.300
So that was the end of the Welsh language in the Allen Valley School.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:51.660
The demise of the Welsh language in the valley is something I'd like to touch on now.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:58.360
Prior to that, your family would have been Welsh speakers, presumably, your ancestors.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.220
Yes.

00:16:59.220 --> 00:16:59.460
Yes.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:00.000
Yes.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:07.520
Do you actually remember any of your family, older relatives, actually speaking Welsh as their day-to-day language?

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.200
Well, my father could speak Welsh quite good.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:17.580
But as he had an English mother, there was English spoke at home, you know.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.340
But his father was fluent Welsh.

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:27.480
And then on my mother's side, the family, they were all fluent Welsh.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:32.520
But, you know, they had died before I was sort of born.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:53.400
So, and my grandfather and grandmother from the clean, they were more English than Welsh because they were both, well, one was brought up at the Gunfan and the other was born, brought up at the Dunfan New Bridge on Wye.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.520
I see.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:04.460
And so, was Welsh not taught at all then in either of those schools, the old one you've mentioned and the current one?

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.580
Was Welsh not taught at all?

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.100
No.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.860
There was no Welsh in school when I was there.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:15.480
Well, we did the national anthem and that in Welsh, but no, it was all English.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:16.280
I see.

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:20.780
And what about your grammar school days then in Llandrindod?

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.100
Did you learn Welsh there at all?

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:24.760
Yes.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:26.500
When I went to Llandrindod, I went to Llandrindod.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:26.500


00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:36.940
I had the choice to either learn Welsh or French and I was taught Welsh with a teacher called Annie Griffiths.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.060
Right.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:50.360
So, sadly, well, there's a real resurgence now in learning Welsh, of course, but it's, you know, it's a little sad.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:55.800
Yeah, my two grandchildren now, Arthur and Marnie, are both in the Welsh unit.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.280
That's a very good idea. That's here in Raeder, is it?

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.460
Yes, in, yes, up in Rintyria.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.240
Oh, okay.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:10.300
Which I am very pleased about because I am very Welsh, you know, in my thoughts.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.180
Very commendable, John, I'm sure.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:21.460
John, could we touch on pony trekking? I understand you had quite an involvement in that in your younger days.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:22.160
Yes.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.780
I was on pony trekking.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:25.780


00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.340
I was on the pony trekking committee for many years.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.300
They were called Raeder Pony Trekking Association.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:40.100
And Mr. David Evans was the secretary and people like Kinsey Morgan and Gerald Morgan were chairman and vice chairman.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:48.940
And I was always interested in it, probably because every year a lot of pretty girls came along.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.080
And I met one called Gina Day.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:59.080
And after on and off romance for four years, I married her.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.600
And she is now still called Gina Jones.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.080
But unfortunately, we got divorced.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.960
But the trekking was a wonderful thing.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:14.520
And I've seen up to 100 ponies going out on a day, you know.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.320
Terrific line of trekkers.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.860
And they came from all over the, well, all over Europe, actually.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:28.180
But in the end, I was guide for two years.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:37.840
And it was a much harder job then because instead of having a trekker for a week who would pick up things, you had day trekkers.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.660
And half of them couldn't ride.

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:45.120
And you couldn't go any faster than the slowest rider or the poorest rider.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.260
And some of you had to lead, you know.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:53.060
But I always found out that if anybody arrived on a mountain, they were going to be a little bit slower.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.040
And if they had a motorbike, they could ride.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.240
The balance was right.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:00.120
I've never seen a poor rider off a motorbike.

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:03.480
Using the same muscles.

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.420
I wouldn't doubt.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:06.840
Fine.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:12.580
Now, John, you've spoken about riding your bike a lot for recreation, etc.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:19.320
Did you use horses as a means of transport for getting around generally at all?

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:20.140
Oh, yes.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.880
My father was always on horseback.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.500
He used to do all the gathering of sheep on horseback.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.840
And I rode a horse a lot.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.420
Like, I was probably riding a three-year-old.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.520
I think I started off on the donkey in Aberystwyth.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.880
But I've got a photo of me on that.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:46.700
And we had a hill up above the Clervin Dam called Clwyddyr.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:49.980
So when we wanted to gather that.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.580
We would ride up to the Henvryn.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.260
And then go over the top of the hill and drop down on Clwyddyr.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.020
Always on horseback.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:03.820
Drive the sheep back down what we wanted to bring down to the Henvryn.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:07.240
Have dinner there with my auntie and uncle.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:11.420
And then drive them down to Llanfadog on horseback.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:16.720
But mind you, in those days, I'm talking up to 1979.

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.040
The roads were much quieter than today.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.420
And you felt quite happy.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.760
Now you can't go 100 yards without a car behind you.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.540
Things have certainly changed, haven't they, in the transport department.

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:38.980
And John, I understand you've worked very hard and long on compiling your family tree.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:45.160
And am I right in thinking that it takes you right back to the Lewis Lloyds, the original landowners?

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:46.180
Yes.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.740
Well, me and my son Tom have done a lot of work on it.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.480
And I've had help of other people.

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:58.300
But being as they were sort of landed gentry, it was quite easy to trace them.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:07.580
But Tom has gone back, I think it's 700 years, to the Powells from Lanarkow, who married into the Lewis Lloyds.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:12.220
And I've got it down to this present day, which I'm very proud of.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:19.400
And now when the dams are very low, the walls of Nantwilt have all come in sight.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.520
And the gardens, you know.

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:27.280
And that's where I think, you know, that it all started for me in the Ellon Valley.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:33.500
Well, it's wonderful to see these houses suddenly arising out of the water, isn't it?

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.980
It makes you want to do that.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.080
You mentioned the Lanarkow.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:44.200
That was Nantwilt, I believe, where the Lewis Lloyds lived.

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:48.360
Were they actually in the Ellon Valley or were they in the Clydwyn Valley?

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:55.380
Well, it's actually on the banks of the Clydwyn River, isn't it?

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.960
The Nantwilt estate.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:05.760
But I mean, they owned so much of it, right up to Clydwyn Farm, which, you know, is miles above the Clydwyn Dam.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:18.600
And one of my ancestors, Peter Jones from Abergwessing, who already was a huge landowner over there and had thousands of sheep,

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:24.880
he married into the Lewis Lloyds and the rest is history, as they say.

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:29.740
And how long have you been working on this family tree then, you and your son?

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:34.500
Oh, you're never finished.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.200
You know, there's something comes up new all the time.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:45.060
I found a cousin in London the other day, Sanders, her name is, Miss Sanders.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.500
And there's a lot of them out in Perth.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.040
And Patagonia.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:25:00.300
And mother's great uncle, David Jones, had a farm out in Buenos Aires.

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.620
And the name of the farm was Elvira.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:08.460
And my mother named my older sister Elvira Mary.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:10.460
How nice.

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.540
Right. You have grandchildren now, John.

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:19.380
Are they enjoying being at the valley and enjoying the places where you grew up?

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:24.820
Yes, because I've still got some ground belonging to Apple and Raddock.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.220
And they love it up there.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:33.120
Arthur went up the other day to burn a bit of cardboard or something, and he thinks it's wonderful.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.420
And Marnie's up there every night with her father, running a dog around.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:42.600
And I think it's nice to get out of town.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:48.380
Well, what better place, indeed, than the beautiful...

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.600
The beautiful Ellen Valley.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:55.800
Well, John, it's been absolutely fascinating talking to you.

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.320
We could go on all day, really, thinking about things.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:03.380
So thank you very, very much for your input, your time, and all your fascinating information.

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:09.360
Thank you very much for you asking me these questions.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.000
You're welcome.
