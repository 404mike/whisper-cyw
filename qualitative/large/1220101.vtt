00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.900
I've got all good memories really, you know, I was very lucky with I had a really happy childhood.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:12.960
I had a good parent and other than that I had a good teenage years.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:22.240
We used to go out a lot with friends and parties and cinema and all the things young people did in those days.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.080
Were your friends mainly Jewish or mixed Jewish?

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.820
Mostly because of the clubs, you know, I went to clubs and that's where I met,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.120
but I had my school friends as well who would always come to a party, you know.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:43.300
I don't remember, everything social seemed to be amongst the Jewish community I have to say and Jewish friends.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.920
We'd have parties and everybody, we had a field, we had a big garden, the bottom of the garden, it's all built over now.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.060
We called it the Wimpy Garden.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.700
It's a Wimpy estate, it's all built up, all behind there.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:06.760
We had a field and in the field we had chickens and a couple of goats and a couple of geese that used to frighten the life out of us

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.080
because they weren't very friendly and a horse which was, my sister was the horse rider.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.000
She had a pony, I should really say, and she absolutely loved it.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.700
Even though there's only 18 months between us, when you're a child, a sister 18 months older than you doesn't, you know, doesn't want to know you really.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:34.400
So she was the one and her friends, a lot of her friends had horses or ponies and she used to take it to like pony club events

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.500
but frightened the life out of me. I wasn't a horse rider.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.440
I may have been daring in some things but horse riding wasn't for me.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.520
You were jealous of her.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.260
I wasn't jealous of her, no.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.880
My father did a silly thing to me. It was his fault I didn't like.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.680
These are silly stories, I don't know if you want silly stories.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:05.340
But he made me get on the horse and I got on and then he threw a stick at the horse so the horse would run off with me sitting on it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.240
and that was it, finished. I wasn't, I wouldn't go on the horse again.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.140
So it was his weird sense of humour I reckon.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.680
Perhaps he didn't want to buy another horse.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.540
He didn't want to buy another horse.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.440
I don't know what made him do that.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.580
So you had two sisters and a brother?

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.180
Yes.
