00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840
Next we come on to the Hunslet which was used underground to all supplies. It was

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.160
used to take men underground. It would be bringing the men out. It would be fitted

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.040
with a diesel engine. You couldn't fit a petrol engine. There'd be too much

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:23.640
danger in gas. Diesel was totally enclosed and was quite safe underground. Providing the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.720
exhaust was long enough and muffled. To your right there's a lump of steel that

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.520
was a steam hammer. This came from Coygnant Collery to Blaenant in 1968.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.340
When it was in commission in Coygnant the anvil that you see next to it would

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.700
have been actually underneath the hammer and protruding through this oblong hole

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.280
in the hammer. And the hammer would have been steam operated. You see the steam

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.360
engine on the left. This would have worked the hammer up and down for shaping

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.700
the steel.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.420
Large sections of steel.
