00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.220
We're now standing in the boiler house where we have six Lancashire boilers that were installed

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:19.820
in 1927 to run the new winding engine. Each boiler held 20 tons of water and they were fired by two

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:29.120
tons of coal every 24 hours. So that's 10 tons of coal for five boilers. I say five boilers because

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:37.380
only five were ever kept in steam. One was always closed for cleaning. You would shut down the boiler,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.540
drain the water out and before the fire actually went out men would be in there cleaning. It was a

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.940
dirty, filthy, thankless job and men would only be in the boiler for five minutes at a time.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.920
One man would go in for five minutes, he would come out, then the next man would go in

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.100
for five minutes, he would come out, then the next man would come out, he would come out,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.140
then the next man would come out, he would come out, he would come out, he would come out,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:07.220
five minutes. The boiler had to be descaled, ash taken out and generally cleaned and it took six

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:14.580
weeks to clean a boiler. Once one boiler was finished, another boiler would be decommissioned,

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.740
the other boiler would be lit and so it went on. In the 50s then, late 50s,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:28.800
there was so much gas coming out of the pit that they started doing methane drainage and using the

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.100
methane to clean the boiler. They started doing methane drainage and using the methane to clean

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.840
the boiler. They started doing methane drainage and using the methane to clean the boiler. So now

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.560
they became dual fuel. You could either run them on gas, or you could run them on coal.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.380
It's a point of interest that probably before the colliery closed, they were running on gas and any

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.400
surplus gas was being fed into the grid. And they were probably getting more for the gas than they

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.300
actually had for the coal they brought to the surface. By this time coal was very difficult to

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.080
win at the depth of the grid. It was too expensive for coal to be produced there. So coal was very

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.600
that they want to do in their school.
