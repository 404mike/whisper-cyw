            <div class="transcript_container"><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:00.000"> The two devolution campaigns, the first in 1979 and the second in 1997, did you follow those debates on television?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:07.860"> I followed them as best I could, but to be quite honest I had very little interest in the first one.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:17.560"> I didn&#039;t think we were ready for it and so it turned out. It was an almighty defeat.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:23.760"> I think the majority of the Welsh people felt like I did, that perhaps the time wasn&#039;t right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:31.520"> And it was in 1979 wasn&#039;t it? Callaghan&#039;s government. Well he was ready to go anyway,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:38.180"> everybody knew that. So I thought, I think there was a bit of a backlash in that,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:43.740"> with unemployment being quite high and his government likely to be kicked out if they</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:50.780"> hadn&#039;t already been. I can&#039;t remember what month of the year it was, when was it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:54.980"> It was March wasn&#039;t it? Well he was definitely in power then wasn&#039;t it, because the election was until</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:00.500"> later with Marvin Thatcher. And I think it was a backlash because his government had</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:08.840"> sort of pushed the idea or presented the idea, offered it. Most Welsh people decided no,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:15.760"> we&#039;re not doing it. But of course when it came to 1997 there were different propositions altogether</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:20.580"> by then, because in the meantime television had played their part in a big way. Margaret Thatcher</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:31.940"> had united Wales in a sense, for the wrong reasons perhaps, but united it nevertheless.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:40.340"> And therefore there was a growing feeling that perhaps Wales would be better off on their own</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:45.090"> without the, I mean we&#039;ve had to suffer the English for the last 800 years haven&#039;t we?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:51.070"> I like your, if they get a no vote today it&#039;ll carry on for a few long, much longer you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:57.550"> Are you able to get home and vote or what? Yes. You are? Yeah. Oh you have to open until 10 isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:02.830"> That&#039;s right. Yeah I&#039;ve got to go down later. No the, I think the, and I mean</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:10.290"> in 97 they only just scraped through didn&#039;t they? 50 to 40, 50 point something to 49 point something.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:22.030"> And it&#039;s strange really because Wales has always been a radical country, a country of radicals if</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:29.130"> you like. Chartist movement and Quakers, non-conformists, Wesleyans, Methodists and so forth.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:38.930"> I mean I&#039;m Annie Bunworth, my father was a Wesleyan Methodist, my mother was a Baptist.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:46.510"> Lots of my friends were Quakers. I mean America&#039;s built on Quakerism a lot of it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:53.250"> It started off, the Mormons were in the same type, from the same ilk, a lot of Welsh people were</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:01.290"> So I think we were ready for some change and I think,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:07.930"> I can&#039;t see that the Welsh Assembly has done any harm to be quite honest and a lot of good.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:12.810"> I see Scotland are following Wales now with free prescriptions.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:17.530"> So they must have done something right. There&#039;s always the feeling amongst the Welsh,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:24.070"> amongst the working class that MPs who&#039;ve never done a decent day&#039;s work in their lives,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:28.930"> I&#039;m quoting other people now, are all for what they can get out of it themselves. Well</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:35.890"> that&#039;s unfortunate but it&#039;s because of the MP expenses which TB highlighted as well as the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:42.470"> newspapers that has caused people to be angry about things. So as soon as people nowadays like</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:51.010"> the Welsh Assembly Ministers put forward an idea, Welsh in particular, they go,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:57.390"> what&#039;s he saying that for? What are they going to get out of it you see? And that&#039;s why people</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:02.810"> are worried like my wife. What&#039;s it going to cost us if they get a yes vote you know?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:10.370"> But at the same time is it right that what we want to do in Wales should be governed by</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:18.610"> people in England? What was, oh yeah, Trwydyn. Because I can remember Trwydyn and Capel Celyn</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:30.250"> getting drowned and at the time it was evident that all 40 odd Welsh MPs had voted against it</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:41.950"> and they were outvoted by their English counterparts because they were in the majority.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:46.770"> What sort of a democracy was that sort of thing you know? When Liverpool could have got</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:54.610"> their water from Cumbria, the wettest part of the United Kingdom, apart from Wales, and the irony</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:04.010"> of it was that once they&#039;d flooded Capel Celyn to create Trwydyn, there were houses overlooking</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:12.770"> the reservoir who couldn&#039;t get water because Liverpool wouldn&#039;t supply pipe water to them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:18.190"> And oh my god you know, if we could cast ourselves adrift and float away like Ireland,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:26.430"> river between us or water between us, we&#039;d be better off I think.</div></div><br>

There&#039;s always the feeling amongst the Welsh,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:23.760"> amongst the working class, that MPs who&#039;ve never done a decent day&#039;s work in their lives,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:28.860"> I&#039;m quoting other people now, are all for what they can get out of it themselves. Well,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:36.240"> that&#039;s unfortunate but it&#039;s because of the MP expenses which TV highlighted as well as the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:42.240"> newspapers that has caused people to be angry about things. So as soon as people nowadays like</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:50.580"> the Welsh Assembly ministers</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:53.760"> put forward an idea, Welsh in particular, they go, what&#039;s he saying that for?

And that&#039;s why people are worried, like my wife, what&#039;s it going to cost us</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:05.320"> if they get a yes vote? But at the same time, is it right that what we want to do in Wales</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:16.440"> should be governed by people in England?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:21.260"> What was</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:24.240"> the idea?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:24.920"> Oh yeah, Trewerin.

And oh my god, you know, if we could cast ourselves adrift,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:23.760"> and float away like Ireland, have a river between us or water between us, we&#039;d be better off I think.</div></div><br>
