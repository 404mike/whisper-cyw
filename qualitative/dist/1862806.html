            <div class="transcript_container"><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:00.000"> Welcome to Mouth Off, a podcast brought to you by Forget Me Not Productions.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:05.700"> My name is Clary Sadler and on today&#039;s episode I&#039;m going to be talking about the iPlusMatter project,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:13.820"> which is a heritage lottery funded project conceived by T. Gwynn Special School in Cardiff</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:20.600"> and inclusive arts organisation Forget Me Not Productions.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:24.680"> iPlusMatter provided multiple opportunities for meaningful assistive technology experiences.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:33.180"> These were interwoven with the arts and music was used as a motivator to enable individuals with</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:40.400"> the most complex physical and cognitive disabilities to share their own history and celebrate their</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:48.780"> independent achievements. The project was launched in February 2020 and was due to conclude in July</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:55.980"> of that year. We were going to have a training event called iPlusMatter Festival and it was going</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:03.060"> to involve professionals in the field of special education and social and health sectors. It was</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:10.060"> also going to be a celebration of the achievements of all involved. The participants would use a</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:16.440"> range of assistive technology such as eye gaze, switches and touch monitors in order to help them</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:24.640"> achieve and independently take part in music and arts sessions. Due to Covid-19 the project was</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:33.640"> postponed and we had to adapt the sharing event and the training event to fit a virtual platform,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:39.940"> pupils at five local special schools, adults from a local day centre and three individuals all with</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:47.120"> complex needs took part in assistive technology and inclusive arts sessions called MusicCan.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:54.600"> MusicCan is a protocol developed by Forget Me Not Production and it uses music primarily as a</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:01.320"> motivator to engage individuals with the most complex needs in assistive technology. T. Gwynn</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:08.600"> with the project lead and other partners included My Sebu Special School, Trinity</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:14.560"> Fields Special School, Park Lane Special School, Gadliss Day Centre and three private clients that</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:21.800"> had all worked with Forget Me Not Productions in the past. Most of the face-to-face MusicCan sessions</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:28.180"> had resumed by the end of 2021 but sadly due to ongoing Covid-19 restrictions Trinity Fields</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:36.700"> Special School had to pull out. Luckily Askol Henvelin Special School stepped in and had the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:42.900"> remaining sessions enabling us to wrap up the project. So what exactly do we mean by assistive</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:49.600"> technology? Well for the purpose of this project we are using the term assistive technology to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:56.020"> include any specialist technology that enables access to a computer. So things such as switches,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:03.220"> touch monitors, eye gaze which is a computer that is operated by eye movements and these are linked</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:10.940"> to specialist software for teaching cause and effect, choice making and beyond, augmentative</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:17.080"> and alternative communication or AAC, specialist controls for wheelchair driving and access to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:24.400"> toys and play. So when eye gaze first became commercially available it was really mostly</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:32.480"> suited for people who were already at a level of using AAC and perhaps were using AAC with</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:39.180"> switches, switches being very effective but slow, slow and laborious. Another focus of iPlusMatter</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:47.340"> has been to provide staff members with the opportunities to be trained in the implementation</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:52.520"> of assistive technology systems for those with the most complex disabilities. Why do you think</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:58.260"> projects such as this iPlusMatter funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund are so important for the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:05.360"> individuals that have been taking part from your school? Well assistive technology like we did have</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:11.460"> eye gaze machines here but they were and they would come on and they&#039;d be broken and they&#039;d</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:17.140"> obsolete. So it&#039;s only now that we&#039;ve started to use the eye gaze because we&#039;ve all returned</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:21.660"> your project is brought to me and we&#039;re using one parent to set an eye gaze in so we&#039;re trying to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:29.000"> re-establish those and also we want to start training the staff and really to see what</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:35.180"> opportunities we can use with the eye gaze. It&#039;s wonderful with your project because you can see</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:40.540"> how well the children have responded to it and how much you really need that in our school.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:45.580"> What have been the main benefits that you&#039;ve seen from the individuals that have taken part</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:50.960"> So to see how much they&#039;ve progressed in the two weeks has been amazing. I think it&#039;s fantastic.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:56.260"> When they get to experience technology and staff get to see what they&#039;re capable of by using that</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:02.300"> technology which gives us infinite access to move forward with purchasing of ourselves and developing</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:08.220"> those skills and pupils get to be able to be part of a project. Parents can share and see that</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:15.360"> you can see what the children are working on and I know the way that our pupils have responded.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:20.740"> They&#039;ve been focused and they&#039;ve really enjoyed it and I think music is such a wonderful access</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:26.840"> for our pupils anyway. So it&#039;s just a wonderful way for them to be focused and to be able to get</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:32.360"> into that niche and they are there. What are the main barriers for these individuals achieving</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:40.840"> independently within a school or daycare setting? The challenge is they need more like</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:46.800"> consistency constantly and they need more more technology things to come in for the children</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:53.020"> to help them progress higher than where they already are. One of the main aims of the project</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:59.720"> has been to empower individuals identified as experiencing profound and multiple learning</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:05.500"> disabilities or individuals that have complex physical disabilities. These individuals use</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:13.300"> assistive technology to experience independent achievement and throughout the project we use the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:19.220"> MusicCan framework to motivate engagement with this technology changing and shifting the focus</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:26.540"> from disability to ability. When I started making music with Forget Me Not productions it changed</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:34.680"> my life. Music transformed me. We hope to raise awareness also of the historical development of</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:41.860"> assistive technologies and the potential impact for independent learning via new technologies</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:47.940"> and new techniques. We speak to Mel Sadler about the history of assistive technology.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:54.560"> But of course by far the biggest development for assistive technology particularly for those</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:00.780"> individuals with the greatest cognitive impairments has been the development of eye gaze. So eye gaze</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:07.800"> worked really well for that group of people straight away. But it took some time for eye gaze</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:13.500"> to be suited for software to come out and be made available for people with more significant</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:19.740"> intellectual impairments as well as their physical disability. But once software such as Look2Learn</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:26.360"> sensory eye effects and some of the inclusive technology softwares became available for eye</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:33.340"> gaze users it&#039;s really opened up a whole new world for that group of learners which is just</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:39.460"> just amazing. And you see people making choices using eye gaze who I would have considered it</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:48.580"> being very difficult to teach them to make choices using switches because using switches to make</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:53.760"> choices is a much higher cognitive load if that makes sense. Yet they can do it with eye gaze.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:03.100"> We also talk to assistive technology guru Carol Thornett. Dr Carol Thornett has been involved</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:10.240"> in the field of assistive technology since 1986. She was a pioneer in exploring the use of assistive</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:17.240"> technology with individuals experiencing profound and multiple learning disabilities. In fact it was</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:23.420"> Carol that developed the first mobility platform which was originally part of the Spastic Society</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:28.680"> research project and had the aim of enabling children with cerebral palsy to explore mobility</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:35.100"> when their peers were able to. With mobility we were trying to get children mobile at the same age</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:41.260"> that their peers would be mobile since we extrapolated those with learning difficulties</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:47.300"> and physical difficulty obviously as well. But initially it was just a physical difficulty.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:54.680"> That proved to be really exciting and I think it&#039;s quite sad now that I see so few with independent</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:01.920"> mobility. They should be in their usual seating because that was always such a problem if they</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:10.380"> were to have a wheelchair service in that what seating would they use. So this was you know that&#039;s</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:17.660"> really the reason why it was a platform that you could attach the whole seating system</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:22.980"> so that you started by looking at whether they could control it and what they would do and</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:29.200"> they stop and stop it as important as going so on. The historic Cragher Park school has also</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:35.600"> been a heritage partner throughout the i-Plus-Matter sessions. Cragher Park House is a country house in</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:41.760"> Pentirk, Cardiff. It was built in 1914 for a colliery owner named Thomas Evans. Evans died in 1943</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:50.700"> and Cragher Park then came into the possession of the National Coal Board before being sold in 1954</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:56.900"> to the Spastic Society. They opened a residential school site in 1955 and the house still operates</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:04.760"> as a residential care facility today. It is also a special school for young adults with learning</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:10.860"> disabilities which is operated by Salutum Healthcare. The school I work in is catered</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:17.180"> for people with disabilities. Research the school you&#039;re going to work in and the students you&#039;re</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:23.980"> going to work with and then it&#039;s just a case of getting to know your colleagues and then getting</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:30.820"> to know you and that should make your job hopefully a lot easier. That was one of the first</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:41.540"> things people used to look at and say. Last time probably a student but that doesn&#039;t happen anymore</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:50.540"> because I&#039;m older and I grow beards and stuff like that so that tends not to happen anymore.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:56.680"> Well my powered wheelchair it can well the batteries last longer which means I can stay out</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:06.200"> for longer I can socialize for longer and be in work for longer and secondly my power chair then</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:15.660"> can also so as you can see the chair the chair that I&#039;m sitting in is actually right in</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:23.600"> which then also helps me in my job professionally when I&#039;m working with students with standing</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:30.360"> frames who are in standing frame sorry and also helps me socially when there is no seating available</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:38.860"> for other people I can then rise myself up to the level that the person is standing to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:44.740"> and then when I&#039;m when I&#039;m done you just go back down so it&#039;s basically far different now so</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:52.680"> used to be there&#039;s no comparison because now I can turn lights on using my voice</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:02.580"> whereas when I was younger I wasn&#039;t able well I wasn&#039;t able to read I wasn&#039;t able to really</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:11.240"> reach the light switches due to them being on a different level. What would you say</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:19.060"> you&#039;re most proud of something you&#039;ve achieved maybe through your use of technology</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:26.160"> that&#039;s helped you achieve that thing?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:31.060"> Could be related to school or it could be games games</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:39.260"> and remote control controls so you&#039;re quite the expert when it comes to games and</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:48.260"> working with control. Yes I need help trying out accessible instruments</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:55.460"> I need help accessing music tech and recording studios. What we&#039;re doing through us really</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:01.460"> isn&#039;t it I guess remotely in the house. When I started making music with Forget Me Not</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:07.480"> productions it changed my life music transformed me I feel like I&#039;m finally using my brain properly</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:14.840"> and I&#039;m using my brain to make music.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:15.980"> Join me next time when I interview Yvonne Kanicki. Yvonne is a programmer and curator</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:22.620"> specializing in black independent film.</div></div><br>

Why do you think projects such as this iPlus Matter</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:01.060"> funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund are so important for the individuals that have been</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:06.580"> taking part from your school?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:08.320"> When they say assistive technology, like we did have eye gaze, case machines here, but they were,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:14.080"> they&#039;ve become old and they&#039;ve been broken and they&#039;re obsolete. So it&#039;s only now that we&#039;ve</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:18.980"> started to use the eye gaze because we&#039;ve followed the term that your project has brought them in,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:23.200"> and we use it to help people with disabilities. So it&#039;s only now that we&#039;ve started to use the eye gaze, because we&#039;ve followed the term your project has brought them in, and we use it to help people with disabilities.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:24.040"> using one parent to set an eye gaze in. So we&#039;re trying to re-establish those, and also we want to start training the staff,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:33.080"> and really to see what opportunities we can use with the eye gaze. It&#039;s wonderful with your project,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:39.540"> because you can see how well the children have responded to it, and how much you really need that in our school.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:45.240"> What have been the main benefits that you&#039;ve seen from the individuals that have taken part in the project?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:50.980"> So to see how much they&#039;ve progressed in the two weeks.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:53.660"> It&#039;s been amazing. I think it&#039;s fantastic.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:55.920"> When they get to experience technology, and staff get to see what they&#039;re capable of by using that technology,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:02.720"> which gives us input as well to move forward with purchasing of ourselves and developing those skills.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:09.100"> And pupils get to be able to be part of a project.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:13.260"> Parents can share and see that project and see what their children are working on.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:17.220"> And I know the way that our pupils have responded. They&#039;ve been focused and they&#039;ve really enjoyed it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:23.520"> And I think music is such a wonderful access for our pupils anyway.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:27.980"> So it&#039;s just a wonderful way for them to be focused and to be able to get into that niche, and they are there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:35.340"> Absolutely.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:36.280"> What are the main barriers for these individuals achieving independently within a school or daycare setting?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:44.340"> The challenge is they need more consistency, and they need more technology things to come in for the children.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:53.520"> And that&#039;s why we&#039;ve had them focus higher than where they already are.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:56.520"> One of the main aims of the project has been to empower individuals identified as experiencing profound and multiple learning disabilities,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:06.160"> or individuals that have complex physical disabilities.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:11.040"> These individuals use assistive technology to experience independent achievement.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:17.360"> And throughout the project we use the Music Can framework to motivate engagement with this technology.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:23.480"> Changing and shifting the focus from disability to ability.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:30.000"> When I started making music with Forget Me Not Productions, it changed my life. Music transformed me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:37.400"> We hope to raise awareness also of the historical development of assistive technologies and the potential impact for independent learning via new technologies and new techniques.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:49.180"> We speak to Mel Sadler about the history of assistive technology.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:53.480"> But of course, by far, the biggest development for assistive technology, particularly for those individuals with the greatest cognitive impairments, has been the development of eye gaze.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:06.760"> So eye gaze worked really well for that group of people straight away.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:10.840"> But it took some time for eye gaze to be suited for software to come out and be made available for people with more significant intellectual impairments, as well as their physical disability.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:22.960"> But we&#039;ve made it available for people with more significant intellectual impairments, as well as their physical disability.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:23.480"> So once software such as Look2Learn and SensoryEyeFX and some of the inclusive technology softwares became available for eye gaze users,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:34.100"> it&#039;s really opened up a whole new world for that group of learners, which is just amazing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:40.020"> And you see people making choices using eye gaze who I would have considered it being very difficult to teach them to make choices using switches,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:51.400"> because using switches to make choices is a much higher cognitive load, if that makes sense.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:57.500"> Yet they can do it with eye gaze.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:02.340"> We also talked to assistive technology guru, Carol Thornett.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:07.520"> Dr. Carol Thornett has been involved in the field of assistive technology since 1986.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:13.840"> She was a pioneer in exploring the use of assistive technology with individuals experiencing profound and multiple learning disabilities.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:21.380"> In fact, it was Carol that developed the first mobility platform, which was originally part of the Spastic Society research project,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:29.540"> and had the aim of enabling children with cerebral palsy to explore mobility when their peers were able to.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:36.920"> With mobility, we tried to get children mobile at the same age that their peers would be mobile.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:42.740"> So it&#039;s been extrapolated to those with learning difficulties and physical difficulties, obviously, as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:49.880"> But initially, it was just a physical difficulty.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:54.360"> That proved to be really exciting.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:56.800"> And I think it&#039;s quite sad now that I see so few with independent mobility.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:02.680"> They should be in their usual seating, because that was always such a problem if they went to a wheelchair service,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:11.640"> in that, you know, what seating would they use?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:15.380"> So this was, you know, that&#039;s the reason why it was a platform.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:18.800"> You could attach the whole seating system so that you started by looking at whether they could control it,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:27.180"> and what they would do, and, you know, if they stopped, they stopped, and this is as important as going, and so on.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:32.800"> The historic Criger Park School has also been our heritage partner throughout the I Plus Matter sessions.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:39.240"> Criger Park House is a country house in Pentirk, Cardiff.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:42.840"> It was built in 1914 for a colliery owner named Thomas Evans.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:47.660"> Evans died in 1943, and Criger Park then came into the possession of the National Coal Board</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:54.540"> before being sold in 1954 to the Spastic Society.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:58.800"> They opened a residential school site in 1955, and the house still operates as a residential care facility today.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:06.940"> It is also a special school for young adults with learning disabilities, which is operated by Salutum Healthcare.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:14.720"> The school I work in is cared for by people with disabilities.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:17.640"> Research the school you&#039;re going to work in, and the students you&#039;re going to work with,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:25.660"> and then it&#039;s just a case of getting to know your colleagues, and them getting to know you,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:32.960"> and that should make your job hopefully a lot easier.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:37.700"> That was one of the first things people used to look at and say.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:44.980"> Last time, probably a C-2.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:47.640"> I was a student, but that doesn&#039;t happen anymore because I&#039;m older and I grow beards and stuff like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:53.260"> So that tends not to happen anymore.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:56.600"> Well, my powered wheelchair, it can, well, the batteries last longer,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:03.460"> which means I can stay out for longer, I can socialise for longer, and be at work for longer.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:11.440"> And secondly, my power chair then can also,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:17.640"> so as you can see the chair, the chair that I&#039;m sitting in is actually rising,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:23.220"> which then also helps me in my job professionally,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:27.300"> when I&#039;m working with students with standing frames,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:30.820"> Warren standing frames, sorry,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:33.640"> and also helps me socially when there is no seating available for other people,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:39.540"> I can then rise myself up to the level that the person is standing to.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:44.780"> And then when I&#039;m done,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:47.640"> you just go back down.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:49.280"> So it&#039;s basically far different now to how it used to be.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:53.600"> There&#039;s no comparison because now I can turn lights on using my voice.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:02.620"> Whereas when I was younger,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:05.760"> I wasn&#039;t able, well, I wasn&#039;t able to really reach the light switches</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:12.480"> due to them being on a different level.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:15.900"> What would you say you&#039;re most proud of something you&#039;ve achieved,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:22.780"> maybe through your use of technology that&#039;s helped you achieve that thing?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:30.280"> It could be related to school or it could be...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:33.240"> Games.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:34.000"> Games?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:39.060"> And remote control, controls.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:43.820"> So you&#039;re quite the expert.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:45.540"> I&#039;m quite the expert when it comes to games and remote control.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:49.500"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:51.200"> I need help trying out accessible instruments.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:55.360"> I need help accessing music tech in recording studios.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:59.520"> This is what we&#039;re doing through us really, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:01.640"> I guess remotely in the house.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:03.920"> When I started making music with Forget Me Not Productions,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:07.940"> it changed my life.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:09.620"> Music transformed me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:11.480"> I feel like I&#039;m finally using my brain properly.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:15.540"> Join me next time when I interview Yvonne Kinnicky.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:19.960"> Yvonne is a programmer and curator specializing in black independent film.</div></div><br>

            <div class="transcript_container"><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:00.000"> Welcome to Mouth Off, a podcast brought to you by Forget Me Not Productions.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:05.400"> My name is Clary Sadler, and on today&#039;s episode, I&#039;m going to be talking about the I Plus Matter</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:12.660"> project, which is a heritage lottery funded project conceived by T. Gwynn Special School</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:19.360"> in Cardiff and inclusive arts organization Forget Me Not Productions. I Plus Matter</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:26.160"> provided multiple opportunities for meaningful assistive technology experiences. These were</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:33.620"> interwoven with the arts, and music was used as a motivator to enable individuals with the most</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:40.660"> complex physical and cognitive disabilities to share their own history and celebrate their</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:48.460"> independent achievements. The project was launched in February 2020 and was due to conclude in July</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:55.840"> of that year. We were going to have a training event called I Plus Matter Festival, and it was</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:02.780"> going to involve professionals in the field of special education and social and health sectors.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:09.680"> It was also going to be a celebration of the achievements of all involved. The participants</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:15.400"> would use a range of assistive technology such as eye gaze, switches, and touch monitors in order to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:23.500"> help them achieve and independently take part in music and arts sessions.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:30.660"> Due to COVID-19, the project was postponed and we had to adapt the sharing event and the training</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:37.480"> event to fit a virtual platform. Pupils at five local special schools, adults from a local day center,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:44.720"> and three individuals all with complex needs took part in assistive technology and inclusive art</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:51.840"> sessions called Music Can. Music Can is a protocol developed by Forget Me Not production, and it uses music</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:59.760"> primarily as a motivator to engage individuals with the most complex needs in assistive technology.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:07.240"> T. Gwynn School were the project lead and other partners included My Sebu Special School, Trinity</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:14.380"> Field Special School, Park Lane Special School, Gadliss Day Center, and three private clients that had all</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:22.020"> worked with Forget Me Not productions in the past. Most of the face-to-face Music Can sessions had resumed by the end of 2021,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:31.130"> but sadly due to ongoing COVID-19 restrictions, Trinity Field Special School had to pull out.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:38.730"> Luckily, a Skolhenvelin Special School stepped in and had the remaining sessions, enabling us to wrap up the project.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:46.250"> So what exactly do we mean by assistive technology? Well, for the purpose of this project, we are using the term</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:54.110"> assistive technology to include any specialist technology that enables access to a computer.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:00.770"> So things such as switches, touch monitors, eye gaze, which is a computer that is operated by eye movements,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:09.830"> and these are linked to specialist software for teaching cause and effect, choice making and beyond,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:16.290"> augmentative and alternative communication, or AAC, specialist controls for wheelchair driving,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:22.830"> and access to toys and play.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:25.350"> So when eye gaze first became commercially available, it was really mostly suited for</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:33.430"> people who were already at a level of using AAC, and perhaps were using AAC with switches,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:39.790"> switches being very effective, but slow, slow and laborious.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:44.950"> Another focus of iPlus Matter has been to provide staff members with the opportunities to be trained in</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:51.470"> the implementation of assistive technology systems for those with the most complex disabilities.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:57.150"> Why do you think projects such as this, iPlus Matter, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:03.370"> are so important for the individuals that have been taking part from your school?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:08.190"> When they see assistive technology, like we did have ideas on case machines here, but they&#039;ve become old,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:15.650"> and they&#039;ve been broken, and they&#039;re obsolete. So it&#039;s only now that we&#039;ve started to use the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:19.850"> ideas because we&#039;ve all returned to your project and brought them in, and we&#039;re using one pair of</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:25.990"> different ideas in. So we&#039;re trying to re-establish those, and also we want to start training the staff,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:33.270"> and really to see what opportunities we can use with the ideas. It&#039;s wonderful with your project,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:39.810"> because you can see how well the children have responded to it, and how much you really need that in our school.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:45.310"> What have been the main benefits that you&#039;ve seen from the individuals that have taken part in the project?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:50.970"> So to see how much they&#039;ve progressed in the two weeks has been amazing. I think it&#039;s fantastic.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:55.630"> When they get to experience technology, and staff get to see what they&#039;re capable of by using that</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:02.110"> technology, which gives us input as then to move forward with purchasing them ourselves and developing</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:08.110"> those skills. And pupils get to be able to be part of a project. Parents can share and see that project,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:15.630"> and see what the children are working on. And I know the way that our pupils have responded, they&#039;ve</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:20.790"> focused, and they&#039;ve really enjoyed it. And I think music is such a wonderful access around</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:27.030"> pupils anyway. So it&#039;s just a wonderful way for them to be focused and to be able to get into that</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:33.470"> niche, and they are there. Absolutely. What are the main barriers for these individuals</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:39.670"> achieving independently within a school or daycare setting? The challenge is they need more</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:46.170"> like consistency, and they need more technology things to come in for the children to help them progress</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:54.430"> higher than where they already are. One of the main aims of the project has been to empower individuals</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:01.790"> identified as experiencing profound and multiple learning disabilities, or individuals that have</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:08.470"> complex physical disabilities. These individuals use assistive technology to experience independent</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:16.550"> achievement. And throughout the project, we use the Music Can framework to motivate engagement with this</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:23.030"> technology, changing and shifting the focus from disability to ability. When I started making music with</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:32.410"> forget-forgetting the not productions, it changed my life. Music transformed me. We hope to raise awareness</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:39.050"> also of the historical development of assistive technologies and the potential impact for independent</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:45.830"> learning via new technologies and new techniques. We speak to Mel Sadler about the history of assistive technology.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:54.290"> But of course, by far, the biggest development for assistive technology, particularly for those individuals with the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:01.850"> with the greatest cognitive impairment has been the development of eye gaze. So eye gaze worked really well for that group of</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:09.050"> people straight away. But it took some time for eye gaze to be suited for software to come out and be made available</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:17.190"> for people with more significant intellectual impairments as well as their physical disability. But once software such as</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:25.410"> look to learn and sensory eye effects and some of the inclusive technology softwares became available</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:32.130"> for eye gaze users, it&#039;s really opened up a whole new world for that group of learners, which is just amazing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:40.650"> And you see people making choices using eye gaze, who I would have considered it being very difficult to teach them to make choices using switches,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:51.530"> because using switches to make choices is a much higher cognitive load, if that makes sense. Yet, they can do it with eye gaze.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:02.510"> We also talked to assistive technology guru Carol Thornette. Dr. Carol Thornette has been involved in the field of</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:11.370"> assistive technology since 1986. She was a pioneer in exploring the use of assistive technology with individuals</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:18.650"> experiencing profound and multiple learning disabilities. In fact, it was Carol that developed the first mobility platform,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:26.170"> which was originally part of the Spastic Society research project and had the aim of enabling children with cerebral palsy</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:33.250"> to explore mobility when their peers were able to.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:36.970"> With mobility, trying to get children mobile at the same age that their peers would be mobile,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:42.910"> since they extrapolated to those with learning difficulties and a physical difficulty obviously as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:50.210"> But initially, it was just a physical difficulty. That proved to be really exciting.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:56.630"> And I think it&#039;s quite sad now that I&#039;ve seen so few with independent mobility. They should be in their usual seating.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:06.990"> Because that was always such a problem if they went to a wheelchair service, in that, you know, what seating would they use?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:15.550"> So this was, you know, that&#039;s really the reason why it was a platform.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:19.290"> That you could attach the whole seating system so that you started by looking at whether they could control it and what they would do and, you know, if they stopped.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:30.510"> And stopping is as important as going and so on.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:32.830"> The historic Criager Park School has also been our heritage partner throughout the iPlusmatter sessions.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:38.990"> Criager Park House is a country house in Pentirk, Cardiff.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:43.030"> It was built in 1914 for a colliery owner named Thomas Evans.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:48.150"> Evans died in 1943 and Criager Park then came into the possession of the National Coal Board before being sold in 1954 to the Spastic Society.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:58.990"> They opened a residential school site in 1955 and the house still operates as a residential care facility today.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:06.930"> It is also a special school for young adults with learning disabilities, which is operated by Salutum Healthcare.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:14.790"> The school I work in is catered for people with disabilities.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:19.270"> Research the school you&#039;re going to work in and the students you&#039;re going to work with.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:25.810"> And then it&#039;s just a case of getting to know your colleagues and them getting to know you.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:33.090"> And that should make your job hopefully a lot easier.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:37.890"> That was one of the first things people used to look at and say.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:45.190"> That I&#039;m probably a student, but that doesn&#039;t happen anymore because I&#039;m older and I grow beards and stuff like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:53.250"> So that tends not to happen anymore.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:56.570"> Well, my powered wheelchair, it can, well the batteries last longer, which means I can stay out for longer.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:06.750"> I can socialise for longer and be in work for longer.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:17.050"> So as you can see, the chair, the chair that I&#039;m sitting in is actually rising, which then also helps me in my job professionally when I&#039;m working with students with standing frames,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:30.750"> who aren&#039;t in standing frames, sorry, and also helps me socially when there is no seating available for other people.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:39.890"> I can then rise myself up to the level that the person is standing to.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:45.110"> And then when I&#039;m, when I&#039;m done, you just go back down.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:49.530"> So it&#039;s basically far different now to how it used to be.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:53.310"> Um, there&#039;s no comparison because now I can turn lights on using my voice.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:02.650"> Whereas when I was younger, I wasn&#039;t able, well, I wasn&#039;t able to really, I wasn&#039;t able to really reach the light switches due to them being on a different level.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:16.010"> So what would you say you&#039;re most proud of something you&#039;ve achieved, maybe through your use of technology that&#039;s helped you achieve that thing?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:30.450"> Could be related to school or it could be...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:33.510"> Games.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:34.330"> Games?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:39.210"> And remote control.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:42.390"> Controls.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:49.490"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:51.310"> I need help trying out accessible instruments.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:55.490"> I need help accessing music tech and recording studios.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:59.530"> This is what we&#039;re doing through us really, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:01.870"> I guess remotely in the house.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:04.170"> When I started making music with Forget Me Not Productions, it changed my life.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:09.810"> Music transformed me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:11.530"> I feel like I&#039;m finally using my brain properly.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:15.490"> Join me next time when I interview Yvonne Kinnicky.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:20.170"> Yvonne is a programmer and curator specializing in black independent film.</div><div class="transcript_line"
