            <div class="transcript_container"><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:04.400"> Jill Jones talking to Shirley Davis, continuation. So Shirley, when the Minera limestone quarry</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:15.880"> closed, can you tell me a little bit about what happened next there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:20.940"> Yes, it was closed for quite some time and there were a number of us in the village who</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:27.140"> were quite concerned about what was going to happen in the limeworks, what the future</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:32.840"> of it was going to be, because it was an area where many of us did walk, but it was becoming</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:41.260"> very overgrown, we were finding it more and more difficult to get in and out of there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:46.540"> And we heard via my husband actually, who was on the council at the time, that it was up for sale.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:00.960"> And as a result of this, a few of us got together, we got together in the City Arms,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:07.780"> which was a pub that was open at the time, and at that first meeting I was appointed as the chair</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:15.880"> of a new group which was looking into what we could do about the quarry, about the limeworks.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:27.160"> We then went for a brainstorming session, which was up in the cycle centre up in Llandegna,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:35.420"> and we formed a committee, and from that committee we then decided that we were going to do our level</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:43.620"> best to get it for the people of the community, for the community of Monera, for them to have it</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:51.220"> as a facility for the whole area. Yes, as an outdoor general access.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:02.240"> Many of the meetings went on in my house. Yes, yes. It was open house. We continued to meet,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:10.780"> we struggled, we really, really struggled very hard trying to get people to listen to us,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:20.320"> and to agree to us doing, you know, having something done with it. Yes. And it was only</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:25.620"> eventually when we managed to get the North Wales Wildlife Trust on board with us that we were able</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:32.780"> to secure it for the people of the community and make it a facility rather than what was becoming</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:40.560"> nice or a problem. Yes. So we, I then stepped down from being the chairperson, and it was taken,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:52.660"> I&#039;ve been a couple of chairmen after that. Yes. But I&#039;m quite pleased to say that as a result of</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:01.000"> the efforts that the group made, it wasn&#039;t just me, but the group. The committee was really good</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:06.540"> and hard working. Absolutely. Yes. And met on a regular basis and we managed eventually to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:14.420"> get the Wildlife Trust on board and with their help and what have you. Yes. It&#039;s now a good.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:22.140"> It is. It&#039;s a good local facility. Yes. And hopefully it&#039;s going to go on and be an even</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:30.600"> better facility in the future. I think it&#039;s got such possibilities. It&#039;s such a brilliant area</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:40.380"> and it&#039;s such a large area. Yes. That we could do all sorts of things there. I&#039;ve still got lots of</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:47.820"> ideas of things that could be done. But we&#039;ve met a lot of people, we&#039;ve had a lot of important</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:54.320"> people that have come up and looked at the area. Yes. Yes. And have all said, you know,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:01.560"> what a wonderful area it is and what a wonderful thing that we should do, that we were doing to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:08.200"> actually try and save it for the community. Because there&#039;s the industrial. Archaeology.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:14.880"> And there&#039;s the general wildlife anyway and there&#039;s</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:28.080"> the nearness for the community. Yes. And even if they don&#039;t walk the mile and a half to get there,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:37.640"> so we need car parking space there. They&#039;re still, they don&#039;t know how many miles they walk</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:45.680"> once they&#039;re in. Absolutely. Absolutely. Yes. Yes. They, you know, it&#039;s a place of entertainment.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:52.920"> It&#039;s a place of learning. Yes. It&#039;s a place of education. It&#039;s a place of</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:01.750"> leisure. Yes. People just go there leisurely. They walk their dogs. They do all sorts of things</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:08.370"> within it. And I think that we&#039;ve managed to do something really worthwhile in ensuring that it&#039;s</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:17.730"> going to be the captain, hopefully, for many, many years to come. Yes. It will be used by the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:23.870"> community. Yes. With local open access for everyone. Yes. I do meet people now when I&#039;m up there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:32.330"> I do find that some of them now, we do have Welsh speaking people going up there quite often.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:38.610"> Going back years ago, most of the people that were up there were Welsh speakers. Yes. Most of</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:45.730"> the quarry workers would have been speaking Welsh, singing Welsh on their way back. They would be.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:51.210"> Yes. But now, for a long time, it&#039;s been a lot of English speaking people and now it seems to be</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:58.130"> going full circle. And we seem to be having a lot of Welsh people up there and, you know, taking</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:03.970"> more notice. We do have lots of foreign people coming as well. Yes, we do. Yes. Yeah. So,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:12.630"> I don&#039;t know if I can extend that. So, thank you very much, Shirley. You&#039;re very welcome. Very</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:18.770"> enjoyable to talk to you today and for you to come and meet us. Thank you.</div></div><br>

save it for the community.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:10.760"> Because there&#039;s the industrial kilns there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:13.980"> Archaeology and...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:15.360"> There&#039;s the general wildlife anyway and there&#039;s the nearness for the community.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:30.040"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:30.440"> And even if they don&#039;t walk the mile and a half to get there, so we need car parking space there possibly.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:40.520"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:41.420"> But they&#039;re still...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:42.720"> They don&#039;t know how many miles they walk once they&#039;re in.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:46.620"> Absolutely.</div><div

it&#039;s the...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:49.620"> You know, it&#039;s a place of entertainment.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:52.540"> It&#039;s a place of learning.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:55.380"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:55.920"> It&#039;s a place of education.</div><div

data-time="00:05:02.880"> People just go there leisurely.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:05.300"> They walk their dogs.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:06.720"> They do all sorts of things within it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:08.760"> And I think that we&#039;ve...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:10.320"> We&#039;ve managed to do something really worthwhile in ensuring that it&#039;s going to be kept in, hopefully, for many, many years to come.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:21.880"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:22.280"> It will be used by the community.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:24.480"> Yes, with local open access for everyone.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:28.680"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:29.220"> I do meet people now when I&#039;m up there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:31.640"> I do find that some of them now...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:34.220"> We do have Welsh-speaking people going up there quite often.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:38.040"> Going back years ago...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:39.720"> Most of the people that were up there were Welsh speakers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:42.860"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:45.020"> Most of the quarry workers would have been speaking Welsh, singing Welsh on their way back.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:49.160"> They would be...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:51.020"> Yeah, but now, for a long time, it&#039;s been a lot of English-speaking people, and now it seems to be going full circle.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:59.240"> It&#039;s turning back.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:59.680"> And we seem to be having a lot of Welsh people up there and, you know, taking more notice.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:04.360"> We do have lots of foreign people coming as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:07.140"> Yes, we do.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:08.360"> Yes.</div><div

you to come and meet us both.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:23.540"> Oh, I&#039;ve enjoyed it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:24.580"> Thank you.</div><div
