to sit and enjoy the view from the bench.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:08.840"> Straight ahead and slightly to the right, perched on top of a smaller hill, is the hillfort of Moel y Gair, Llanbeder.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:17.440"> Samantha Williams is the hillfort conservation officer for the Heatherner Hillforts project and is involved in the work on Moel y Gair.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:25.900"> She talks about what it may have been used for.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:29.180"> From here you can see Moel y Gair, Llanbeder.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:32.480"> Hillforts possibly have many functions.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:34.900"> They are defended enclosures, so they are something that is defensive.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:39.600"> They have massive banks and ditches, which are called ramparts, and they would have had a wooden fence on top called a palisade.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:46.240"> So that does suggest that their aim was to keep people out, so possibly places that they retreated to in times of trouble and conflict.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:56.480"> But it could also be that they were...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:58.440"> They were sort of farming centres on top of the hill, a bit like a Havod site in the medieval times.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:05.520"> So you turn your flocks out onto the hill during the summer.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:10.400"> So they could be centres where those people collected their flocks when they needed to sort of do shearing or something.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:19.220"> And today our greatest predator is a fox, but in those days they had things like brown bears and wolves.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:28.440"> And we forget that they were massive creatures, so it could be to protect your stock from those animals as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:35.540"> And also, hillforts are on top of great massive hills, and they are really obvious features within the landscape.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:43.100"> So they could be centres that people could gather to, to maybe celebrate births, deaths and marriages.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:49.480"> Or for trading centres, where they could trade goods with other Celtic settlements around in the area.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:55.920"> So they could have many, many functions.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:58.440"> We just don&#039;t know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:00.740"> Next, hear about the Bronze Age from Fiona Gill, Denbighshire County archaeologist.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:08.620"> As you&#039;re sitting on the bench, looking out towards the Vale of Clwyd and admiring the view,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:12.980"> just look slightly to your right and you&#039;ll see this heap of stones.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:17.900"> Higgledy-piggledy heat doesn&#039;t look as if it&#039;s got much shape to it, but actually that&#039;s the remains of a Bronze Age cairn.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:25.400"> Presumably, originally, it either had more stone there or...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:28.440"> was covered up with turf and earth, and somehow that&#039;s become eroded.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:33.820"> Possibly in the middle of there we&#039;ve got a burial from 2000 BC, 4,000 years ago.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:39.700"> Maybe even some later cremations added into the mound.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:44.000"> Difficult to imagine now from that heap of stones, but we&#039;ve got to picture maybe a group of people coming up to bury their mother, father or whatever.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:53.980"> And feeling much as we would at a funeral too.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:57.080"> So we&#039;ve got to try and put ourselves in the right place.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:58.420"> And put ourselves back in the shoes, if they wore shoes, of people in the Bronze Age.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:04.000"> When you&#039;re ready, follow the path onwards until you reach audio point 3 on a wooden way marker opposite another bench.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:12.720"> On your way, you will catch your first glimpse of the Jubilee Tower in the distance.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:18.560"> For additional information on hillforts from Samantha Williams, continue listening, otherwise hang up now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:27.100"> The features of the hillfort are that you can see the stone, the stone is a bit of a stone.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:28.400"> The features of the hillfort are that they have ramparts, which are big banks and ditches.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:33.420"> Some hillforts even have more than one.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:36.180"> They also have interned entrances, so the banks turn into the entrance, which would have been protected by a massive gate.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:44.420"> So that made them quite a defensive structure again.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:47.660"> On top of the ramparts, we would have had a Keniltsen Palisade, which is a big wooden fence.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:54.000"> And there would have been round houses within the walls.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:58.400"> The roundhouse is a circular structure that&#039;s made of timber, which would have had a thatched roof, which would have gone pretty much to the floor to keep the walls dry.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:09.420"> The walls would have been made up of wattle and daub, which is hazel or willow that&#039;s weaved through stakes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:15.680"> And then covered in daub, which is a mixture of clay, animal dung and straw.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:21.260"> And inside the roundhouse, there would have been a central hearth, so a fireplace in the middle to keep everybody warm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:28.400"> And that fire would have gone up into the thatch, and that would have killed any bugs that was in the thatched roof and kept it nice and snug and warm inside.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:37.520"> And they could have also had meats and things hanging from the ceiling, so it would have smoked the meat and kept it for the winter months.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:45.320"> So it would have been a nice cosy structure inside the hillfort, nestled in, and could have been used possibly in times of retreat if the hillfort was a defensive structure.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:56.820"> Or maybe, what I&#039;m saying is, it would have been a very, very safe structure.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:58.400"> During the summer months, they might have lived up there in the summer months.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:01.660"> The roundhouse comes in different sizes, so there might have even been different functions for roundhouses, maybe somewhere like your garden shed is today.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:10.820"> There is evidence for grain stores as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:13.480"> At Morla Gaea Resezmore, which is just off the Clwydion Range, outside our project area, they did a big excavation there and they found four post holes and a square in the ground.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:24.300"> And it&#039;s believed that these are grain stores.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:26.040"> A squared structure raised off the ground.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:28.400"> They would have put grain in to keep it and store it over the winter months as well.</div></div><br>
