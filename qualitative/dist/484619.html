            <div class="transcript_container"><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:01.500"> Interview number three, interviewer Steve Fletcher, Artistic Director of Swiffer Carnival,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:08.080"> interviewee Rob Davie. Rob could you spell your name for us please? Yes Rob is R-O-B and Davie is</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:14.500"> D-A-V-E-Y. Thank you very much. So please can you tell us how did you first get involved with the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:21.560"> Cardiff Mask Carnival? Yes I remember it well actually. In 1992 my wife Alva got herself</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:28.560"> involved in the carnival which I think was held at Fitzallen that year and my recollection of that</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:35.760"> year is that I was working most of the time but came down on odd occasions during the evening to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:42.400"> have a look and see exactly what my wife had got herself and our children involved in and thought</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:49.460"> it probably wasn&#039;t really for me. It seemed to be a lot of sewing and chatting and a huge amount of</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:56.660"> material going on there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:58.560"> And it didn&#039;t seem to be something that I really wanted to get myself involved in. However I certainly</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:05.320"> watched that carnival and then the next year I decided that if I had any chance of actually seeing</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:10.660"> my wife and children for three weeks that summer and probably the forthcoming summers I probably</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:16.260"> had to get involved myself and that&#039;s really what I did. And I think that year I messed about with</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:29.580"> the whole idea of having a look at the carnival and then the following year which is 1994, the blues</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:34.240"> year as I recall, there was a lot of blue paint going around which left an indelible stain on our</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:41.060"> bath, at least for many many weeks. I did actually get myself into a costume, something that I would</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:46.660"> never have thought I would ever have done. And we never looked back for the next sort of eight,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:54.480"> nine years I think. Got myself into costume every year. I got myself into a costume every year and</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:00.140"> I messed about, sang a lot of songs, chanted a lot of chants and generally had a good time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:07.720"> Is there one costume in particular that&#039;s a standout costume for you out of the many that you</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:13.060"> played over the years? Yeah I think so. I think it&#039;s pretty obvious. I think it generally agreed</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:17.000"> amongst the family is probably the Player of Games which was, I don&#039;t know when that was,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:21.380"> mid to late 90s probably. I don&#039;t know whose idea it was but I know my wife made the costume</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:29.060"> and I remember standing on the steps of the museum wearing this darn costume and it was a pretty</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:38.380"> pretty smart costume actually. I enjoyed wearing that one. Yeah. In terms of the value of Carnival</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:44.380"> and its impact, if you had to describe some of the benefits that you perhaps you&#039;ve seen personally</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:51.520"> or amongst your family or as a long time, you know, 10 years of Carnival involvement you&#039;ll have seen a lot.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:58.560"> Yeah. How does it affect people? Well I think from this perspective which is some time after,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:03.220"> we&#039;ve not done it for a number of years now because we moved away from Cardiff so we&#039;ve not</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:08.100"> been able to really. I think it&#039;s fair to say that it&#039;s definitely changed and enhanced our lives</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:17.520"> but I think more than that I think it&#039;s actually informed our kids lives because they started doing</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:22.480"> Carnival when they were quite young, I don&#039;t know about 9 and 11, something like that. And I don&#039;t</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:28.560"> that as far as they&#039;re concerned their lives have been changed because of it for instance my son guy</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:36.240"> went into theater where he remains and I think that was certainly helped by being involved in</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:43.560"> mass and I&#039;m Tasha my daughter went to Africa went to Senegal and married a Senegalese man</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:50.480"> and I think the fact that we lived on the face of it a suburban middle-class life in Cardiff would</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:59.240"> have meant it would been quite difficult for us to have been involved in it with in and with sort</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:03.980"> of people that that mass brought us into contact with and whilst I think we had the values of</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:13.100"> multiculturalism and integration with with other groups of people I think it would have been</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:17.500"> difficult to realize without the mass and I think that&#039;s what the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:20.200"> the mass would have been able to do and I think that&#039;s what the mass would have been able to do</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:20.460"> and I think that&#039;s what the mass has done for us and has done for many people it&#039;s brought people</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:25.360"> together who otherwise wouldn&#039;t have come together I think that&#039;s that&#039;s its Essence really and you</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:30.740"> mentioned chanting earlier uh do you recall any of the charts would you care to share one with us for</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:36.160"> posterity ah well yes um I do recall the chance I remember um my kids getting very involved with the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:44.000"> workshops and actually Tasha who was quite a small girl then um she was probably only about 10 or 11.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:50.840"> leading some of the chants um and you know we we I think we all recorded them as a family</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:58.540"> um and they&#039;re certainly somewhere around I&#039;m not sure if I can remember them well enough to actually</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:04.060"> uh to actually sing now to be honest um that might come back to me no worries and obviously uh after</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:11.700"> three weeks of workshop there&#039;s the you know the big blowout the parade itself can you go what kind</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:17.880"> of audience reactions can you</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:19.920"> recall um I remember in fact today because we we&#039;ve been talking about mass today um and I was</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:28.060"> looking at one of my diary entries um from from the early days and I actually said in my diary that</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:34.220"> um I think that was the year I was drumming and I actually said didn&#039;t really see anything of the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:40.680"> mass at all um didn&#039;t really know what was going on I was so involved with the drumming and because</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:47.220"> drumming certainly wasn&#039;t my forte</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:49.920"> I was I think I was doing a lot of counting um during the mass itself so certainly that one</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:55.420"> um I I didn&#039;t really see much of at all gradually as I got more used to the mass I think I think you</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:02.480"> tend to look up and look around and and I just remember huge crowds lining the streets um and</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:09.680"> um I I do remember wishing that the crowd would actually uh interact more with with the actual</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:19.920"> mass um and I think in a way we were doing it for ourselves I think it was a wonderful</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:23.680"> that they were there um uh I do remember one year with Zouvier which is the the the night before the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:48.780"> the carnival um uh cruising through the cafe quarter in cardiff um which had just then opened</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:55.740"> it was a brand new cafe quarter and something that we hadn&#039;t really ever seen before people</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:01.280"> sitting outside um on the on the pavements drinking and eating and getting a huge response</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:07.680"> from them but during the actual mass itself i&#039;m i i was pretty wrapped up in what we were doing</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:13.240"> really to to be anything other than just vaguely aware of this huge body of people somewhere uh</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:19.360"> around us yeah unless you care to give us a chance i think that was the top only two you</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:28.600"> touched on everything i could hope for okay i don&#039;t feel obliged on the chat because natasha</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:33.140"> really did sing a heart yeah no that&#039;s fine i&#039;ll leave that to tasha to um</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:37.620"> switch that off that was brilliant there was a number of</div></div><br>

I knew that they were there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:43.860"> I do remember one year with Jouvet, which is the night before the carnival,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:51.340"> cruising through the café-courter in Cardiff, which had just then opened.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:55.940"> It was a brand new café-courter.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:58.540"> And something that we hadn&#039;t really ever seen before, people sitting outside on the pavements drinking and eating,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:06.580"> and getting a huge response from them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:09.140"> But during the actual M.A.S. itself, I was pretty wrapped up in what we were doing, really,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:14.440"> to be anything other than just vaguely aware of this huge body of people somewhere around us.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:24.480"> Unless you care to give us a chance, I think that was the top-holy interview.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:28.640"> You touched on everything I could hope for.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:31.380"> I don&#039;t feel obliged to ask the chant for it, because Natasha really did sing it hard.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:35.080"> Yeah, no, that&#039;s fine.

It seemed to be a lot of sewing and chatting and a huge amount of material going on there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:58.280"> And it didn&#039;t seem to be something that I really wanted to get myself involved in.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:03.260"> However, I certainly watched that carnival and then the next year I decided that if I had any chance of actually seeing my wife and children for three weeks that summer,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:13.780"> and probably the forthcoming summers, I probably had to get involved myself.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:17.260"> And that&#039;s really what I did. And I think that year I messed about with some face paints, did a bit of stewarding and generally caught the bug.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:29.560"> And then the following year, which is 1994, the blues year, as I recall, there was a lot of blue paint going around,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:39.120"> which left an indelible stain on our bath, at least for many, many weeks.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:43.880"> I did actually get myself into a costume, something that I would never have thought I would ever have done.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:51.360"> And we never looked back for the next sort of eight, nine years, I think. Got myself into costume every year.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:00.600"> Messed about, sang a lot of songs, chanted a lot of chants and generally had a good time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:07.820"> Is there one costume in particular that&#039;s a standout costume for you out of the many that you played over the years?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:14.320"> Yeah, I think so. I think it&#039;s pretty obvious. I think it generally agreed amongst the family is probably the player of games,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:19.540"> which was, I don&#039;t know when that was, mid to late 90s probably.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:24.000"> I don&#039;t know whose idea it was, but I know my wife made the costume.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:29.720"> And I remember standing on the steps of the museum wearing this darn costume.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:36.820"> And it was a pretty, pretty smart costume, actually. I enjoyed wearing that one.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:41.620"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:42.700"> In terms of the value of Carnival and its impact, if you had to describe some of the benefits that perhaps you&#039;ve seen personally</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:51.600"> or amongst your family or as a long time, you know, 10 years of Carnival involvement, you&#039;ll have seen a lot.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:58.580"> Yeah. How does it affect people?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:00.420"> Well, I think from this perspective, which is some time after, we&#039;ve not done it for a number of years now</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:05.900"> because we moved away from Cardiff, so we&#039;ve not been able to really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:09.380"> I think it&#039;s fair to say that it&#039;s definitely changed and enhanced our lives.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:17.060"> But I think more than that, I think it&#039;s actually informed our kids&#039; lives</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:21.260"> because they started doing Carnival when they were quite young.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:24.220"> I don&#039;t know, about 9 and 11, something like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:27.280"> And I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s any question that, as far as they&#039;re concerned,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:30.460"> their lives have been changed because of it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:33.240"> For instance, my son, Guy, went into theatre, where he remains.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:39.180"> And I think that was certainly helped by being involved in Maz.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:44.520"> And Tasha, my daughter, went to Africa, went to Senegal and married a Senegalese man.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:50.860"> And I think the fact that we lived on the face of it, a suburban middle class life in Cardiff,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:59.000"> would have meant it would have been quite difficult for us to have been involved in</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:02.540"> and with the sort of people that Maz brought us into contact with.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:06.680"> And whilst I think we had the values of multiculturalism and integration with other groups of people,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:16.640"> I think it would have been difficult to realise without the Maz.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:18.880"> And I think that&#039;s what the Maz has done for us and has done for many people.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:24.940"> It&#039;s brought people together who otherwise wouldn&#039;t have come together.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:27.640"> I think that&#039;s its essence, really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:30.320"> You mentioned chanting earlier.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:31.920"> Do you recall any of the chants?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:33.940"> Would you care to share one with us for posterity?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:37.600"> Ah, well, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:39.120"> I do recall the chants.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:40.980"> I remember my kids getting very involved with the workshops.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:44.620"> And actually, Tasha, who was quite a small girl then,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:48.100"> she was probably only about 10 or 11, leading some of the chants.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:54.720"> And, you know, I think we all recorded them as a family.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:59.400"> And they&#039;re certainly somewhere around.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:01.580"> I&#039;m not sure if I can remember them well enough to actually sing now, to be honest.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:07.360"> That might come back to me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:08.820"> No worries.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:09.340"> No worries.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:10.100"> Obviously, after three weeks of workshop, there&#039;s the big blowout, the parade itself.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:17.280"> What kind of audience reactions can you recall?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:22.580"> I remember, in fact, today, because we&#039;ve been talking about Maz today,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:27.420"> and I was looking at one of my diary entries from the early days.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:31.740"> And I actually said in my diary that, I think that was the year I was drumming,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:37.340"> and I actually said, didn&#039;t really see anything of the Maz at all.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:42.460"> Didn&#039;t really know what was going on.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:44.060"> I was so involved with the drumming, and because drumming certainly wasn&#039;t my forte,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:49.420"> I think I was doing a lot of counting during the Maz itself.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:54.500"> So certainly that one, I didn&#039;t really see much of at all.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:58.820"> Gradually, as I got more used to the Maz, I think you tend to look up and look around.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:04.440"> And I just remember huge crowds lining the streets.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:11.300"> And I do remember wishing that the crowd would actually interact more with the actual Maz.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:20.260"> And I think, in a way, we were doing it for ourselves.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:22.780"> I think it was a wonderful thing for people, and people kept coming year after year to watch us.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:27.820"> But I know that within the Maz group, we were doing it because we wanted to do it more than the crowd.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:36.060"> And personally, I wasn&#039;t ever that aware of the crowd.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:40.420"> I knew that they were there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:43.340"> I do remember one year with Jouvet, which is the night before the carnival, cruising through the cafe quarter in Cardiff, which had just then opened.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:55.780"> It was a brand new cafe quarter.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:57.460"> And something that we hadn&#039;t really ever seen before, people sitting outside on the pavements, drinking and eating, and getting a huge response from them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:08.920"> But during the actual Maz itself, I was pretty wrapped up in what we were doing, really, to be anything other than just vaguely aware of this huge body of people somewhere around us.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:21.560"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:24.440"> Unless you care to give us a chant, I think that was the top-hole interview.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:28.640"> You touched on everything I could hope for.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:30.860"> Okay.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:31.400"> I don&#039;t feel obliged on the chant front, because Natasha really did sing a heart attack.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:35.100"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:35.500"> No, that&#039;s fine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:36.200"> I&#039;ll leave that to Natasha to take things.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:38.020"> Thank you very much.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:38.580"> I&#039;ll switch that off.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:39.560"> That was brilliant.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:40.280"> There was a number of...</div></div><br>
