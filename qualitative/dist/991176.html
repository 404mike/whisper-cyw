            <div class="transcript_container"><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:00.000"> Community House was run by the Christian Church to start with. It isn&#039;t any longer, but it was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:06.680"> And so the boys in the Asian Youth Club were coming into a Christian environment.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:14.420"> Now, was this a problem? Was it seen as a problem by the boys or by you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:20.260"> I think, I mean, I&#039;m not looking to be boastful here, but I think Eton Road and Community House at the time were quite lucky</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:27.320"> that they were working with people who were, had a legitimacy in the community.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:32.920"> They were people who were respected in their communities. People like Monis Moflahi, myself.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:38.800"> We had a lot to do with the local mosque in Harrow Road. Monis had a lot to do with the mosque in Alexander Road in Pell.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:47.040"> We had a young lad from Llanwern Street, one of the local Pakistani lads who was very well respected, a very good footballer.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:54.240"> And a Bangladeshi lad. So we had a range of people from different areas, different skills, different knowledge,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:02.800"> and who could relate to the young people. So we almost acted as a bridge between Community House</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:10.660"> and, in inverted commas, the church in the background, and the wider Muslim community in the area.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:18.280"> I think we looked at the building and we saw, we realised there was a church element to the building,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:28.180"> but we always saw it, we always saw the community part of the building as the greater part of the building.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:37.360"> Now, I don&#039;t know why we did that. There was nobody ever said to us, well, this is a community centre more than it&#039;s a church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:44.800"> But for some reason, we just kind of imagined it so, and we were happy to, you know, to go along with that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:51.540"> But I think more important than the building and the church was the people who were coming to the building,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:58.220"> the young people. We as workers, people like Brian, other people who were involved with the building.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:04.000"> And it was the people who kind of acted as, you know, the bridge and made contact with other people and spoke to other people.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:15.340"> So I think the role of the building was secondary.</div></div><br>
