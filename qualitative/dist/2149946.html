            <h2>A</h2>
            <div class="transcript_container"><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:02.440"> Good afternoon, we&#039;re here this afternoon with Mr. Brian Quinlan, who is one of the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:09.260"> longest attending gardeners at Stackpole Wall Garden. And we&#039;re interviewing him today,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:19.360"> which is the 2nd of February 2023, and this is part of the Citizen Curator Project, an</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:28.400"> oral history project, because people that have been working here, and certainly very</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:33.600"> few for as long as Brian, are able to tell us so much more about the gardens. So I&#039;m</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:40.560"> working this afternoon with Julian Rollins, my colleague here, who is the tutor at Stackpole,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:46.640"> so I&#039;m going to hand over and then we&#039;re going to have a bit of a chat. Okay, Julian.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:52.300"> Thank you, yeah. Thanks for giving us your time, Brian, because it&#039;s a busy day, isn&#039;t it? When</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:00.340"> were you born, Brian? When? When were you born, what year? 1939. Is that current now? Yeah,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:08.240"> so that&#039;s just as the war, the Second World War, was started. When the war was started, yeah. Where</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:14.040"> were you living then as a child? Where did you live as a child? Outside Tempe, Comperson.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:21.620"> Comperson, near Tempe, so you were... But the farm was down in the valleys. We had to go through a gate and then walk down to the farm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:32.920"> And your dad was the farmer? Yeah, my father was. Yeah. Was that Astridge, or what was the name of</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:39.980"> that farm? Can you remember the name? No, a long time ago. No, no, gosh. So when you were small,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:49.480"> were you helping out around the farm then? Yeah. What did they used to have you doing? What? What did your dad used to ask you to do?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:58.760"> I knew he was on the tractor and horses ploughing with horses. Then I went on the tractor after that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:09.460"> What age were you when you were driving the tractor? I don&#039;t know. Small? 9 or 10. That was quite something to have a tractor</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:19.220"> then, because I remember my father telling me, you know, it was mainly horses, wasn&#039;t it? Quite a thing to have a tractor.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:29.200"> Yeah. Can you remember what tractor it was? The Fordson Major, small one, before they had the blue ones.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:37.340"> What colour would a Fordson be then? Blue. The big one, yeah. So you, from a very young age then, you were working outdoors,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:48.680"> doing outdoor stuff? I was walking around with my father when he was ploughing, and with the tractor.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:55.140"> Yeah. And you remember the name of any of the horses? We had two. Did you? Brown one with a white face.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:05.460"> And they used to use horses here at the garden, didn&#039;t they? Before we were all around. There&#039;s a photo, isn&#039;t there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:12.200"> Yeah. So when did you, can you remember when you first came here then, Brian? First came to Stadpole?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:22.300"> I think when I went to the Anchorage first, I think. Any idea what year that was? No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:31.200"> So you&#039;re, how old are you now? You&#039;re 83. Three. Gosh, yeah. 84 Monday week. Oh really? Oh. Did that go on there then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:40.820"> Yeah. 84 Monday week. And so what did you do between sort of finishing at the farm? Were you working other places or?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:54.560"> I went to the Gulf Refinery then. Oh, right, right. And I grew up working in the canteen.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:03.400"> Ah, so they love you in the kitchen if they hear that here. Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:09.340"> So you think, would you have been around 50 when you started working here or older?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:19.120"> I&#039;m not sure, a bit older probably. A bit older, yeah, yeah. About 20 or so years ago probably, I suppose.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:26.440"> That&#039;s when, yeah, things really got going here. Is there anyone else here now who was here when you first came?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:37.840"> I can&#039;t remember. No, I don&#039;t think so. No, no. No, so you really are the one that, you know what&#039;s what then, yes. Okay.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:49.940"> So you said to me a little earlier that when you first came here, the garden was in a bit of a state.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:58.420"> Overgrown, yeah. What was it like? What was growing in here? A lot of nettles and brambles and trees.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:08.160"> Trees? Yeah, small trees, big trees like that. Wow. From the gate, you couldn&#039;t open the gate, it was,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:18.160"> well you opened the gate but it was full of brambles and nettles so we had to clear it all down.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:24.100"> Wow, so it was like clearing a jungle. Yeah. So that, was that the first job then, just cutting your way in?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:32.620"> Yeah. How would, how did you do that? What sort of tools did you use, can you remember?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:41.120"> Saw, secateurs, clippers. No power tools, no strimmers back then? I can&#039;t remember, I don&#039;t think so.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:53.080"> And was there a big gang of you then or was it just three or four? A few of us.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:59.100"> Oh. And was Mr. Bateman here then or? Yes, George Bateman. George Bateman, ah right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:09.980"> He was the head gardener then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:15.520"> And did you see many members of the public in those days, were there many visitors?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:22.680"> Yeah, I think it was a few walking around. Right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:30.000"> So once the place had been cleared, was the, were there the area that is now vegetable beds,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:40.700"> was that the first bit that was cleared? Yeah, we worked on them then, do them over.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:49.620"> And were there, was there a greenhouse? Was there a greenhouse?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:56.320"> Yeah, there was, but I wasn&#039;t near it then. Oh right, okay.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:02.620"> So you, do you remember that first sort of spring or whatever planting, was it, you know,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:09.680"> quite something to fight, make enough space to do your planting? Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:16.480"> What do you remember about that? Digging and, did you choose what to plant then? Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:24.280"> What did Mr. Bateman tell you? Was it, who was making the... Digging in the tunnels,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:33.300"> or the tomatoes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:37.600"> So that was when you got the tunnels underway, was it? Yeah. Just out here or? Yeah. Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:45.300"> So you grew tomatoes from an early, early stage then? Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:49.840"> Oh right. And what else were you growing back then? Hmm? What else were you growing back then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:00.040"> Can you remember? Tomatoes. Yeah. Onions, leeks, potatoes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:07.040"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:15.580"> And was there, did you have that little tractor, was there a little tractor back there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:21.100"> Yeah, we had a small, a small, a small tractor.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:25.220"> Was it the same as the one you&#039;d had at home? No. No? Small, grey one.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:32.180"> But you felt sort of okay about the tractor, obviously. Yeah. Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:40.280"> And did you, how many times a week then did you come? Was it just once a week or?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:49.920"> I think it was when we was clearing the garden.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:54.980"> Hmm. And what was your general feeling? Did you, you know, want to come back?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:01.320"> Did you find it satisfying to work here? Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:07.600"> In what way then? Was it more like going back to your roots sort of thing? Yeah. Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:17.000"> Did it remind you of when you were a child on the farm?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:21.460"> No. No. The tractor and stuff, there wasn&#039;t? Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:26.760"> So with the, with the crops you were growing then, you were growing onions, potatoes, leeks,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:32.660"> tomatoes, where, where did all of that produce go to?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:39.560"> You know, they used to take some veg into the shop in Ivory West. Oh, right. Next to the one,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:47.640"> next to the, the pub, I think. What was the name of that? Spar. Oh, yeah. In, in Bridge Street in</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:57.580"> Halford West or? No. In the town. Next to the King&#039;s Arms. Oh, right. There you are. Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:04.400"> There was a shop there and they used to buy veg, obviously. And I think you live in Halford West</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:12.320"> now, don&#039;t you? Were you living there then? When I was here? No. No. I see. Because the charity</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:23.060"> Pembrokeshire Mencap was originally started off in Halford West, so I guess that&#039;s probably the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:30.100"> link for selling the vegetables over there, isn&#039;t it? Yeah. Did you know Ian or, you know Ian that</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:40.600"> comes down? From the committee. Yeah. Did you know him then? Was he here then? I can&#039;t remember.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:48.400"> I think he was. Probably did overlap, I should think. Yeah. Yeah. We can hear the blasting in</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:56.140"> the background. That&#039;s the, the military, isn&#039;t it, down on Castle Martin? You get used to that</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:01.360"> noise, don&#039;t you? Yeah. On the ranges. It&#039;s part of life here, isn&#039;t it? Listening to the,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:06.400"> the guns going off. So, so you were, you would have been coming once a week then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:15.000"> Yeah, I think so. How did you get here? On the van. On a van, yeah. Like a minivus. Yeah. Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:23.180"> With other people who were coming to work. Yeah. Who would be doing the driving then back then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:30.040"> George, the basement, I think. George would come and pick you up. What sort of time of day?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:36.800"> Half past nine in the mornings. And then you&#039;d be here for a whole day, would you? Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:41.880"> Putting the day&#039;s work. You bring your dinner with you then, did you? Yeah. Yeah, you bring your lunch, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:49.160"> Yeah. Were there women in those days? Any women on the bus? I think so. Yeah, like today, a little bit</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:57.020"> of a mix. I&#039;ve just seen Jane there in the, in the greenhouse today. Yeah. Yeah. Did you take vegetables</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:05.140"> home after you&#039;d grown them? Did you have your own plots in those days or was it more? No. No,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:11.160"> it was more general. Yeah. I see. I was going to, you&#039;d mentioned lunch, hadn&#039;t you? So when you</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:20.920"> had, you bought a pack lunch in with you. Yeah. Where did you eat it in those days then when the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:35.920"> makes the tea? The corrugated iron shed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You&#039;d have tables and chairs and</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:43.620"> electric fire in there. Quite cosy. Yeah. You&#039;ve seen a lot of changes, Brian. You know, a lot of</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:56.450"> change over the years. Yeah. How does it feel? Is that good or bad?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:03.970"> Couldn&#039;t be bad.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:08.430"> You&#039;re a good advert for it. You&#039;ve kept fit, haven&#039;t you? Yeah. You kept fit. Do you enjoy that,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:15.330"> you know, that physical work is good, isn&#039;t it? Yeah. Yeah. So what is it you&#039;re working on today,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:22.870"> Brian? We&#039;re digging the sides out. We&#039;re going to put the Maipax on top, tuck it in to the trench</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:34.190"> then and then put it back in. Right. So is that this? And it&#039;ll hold the Maipax down. This is the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:41.490"> stuff that the strawberries will go underneath? Yeah. Yeah. We make holes in the Maipax and plant</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:49.970"> through like the tomatoes. So you&#039;re establishing a new strawberry bed, isn&#039;t it? Yeah. And is that</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:59.190"> good? Cos do strawberries, does it need to be sort of refreshed every? Yeah. Tell us a bit about that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:06.290"> They grow better then. Do they? When they&#039;re replanted with a Maipax. Yeah. And Maipax is like</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:12.690"> this sort of film, like it helps to stop the weeds, doesn&#039;t it? Yeah. And is it particular</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:19.650"> strawberries? Do you grow El Santa or strawberries do you grow? Do you know? Any kind then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:27.470"> They&#039;re quite early though, aren&#039;t they? Cos they come, I always seem to think they come quite early</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:32.930"> here. Yeah. And have people always come to pick the strawberries? Do you remember people doing</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:39.870"> pick your own in the past? Yeah. I think they grow better when they&#039;re in the Maipax.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:48.450"> Do they? Why is that? Cos the birds gets at them when they&#039;re loose and some goes bad.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:56.250"> So we get Jays coming in and stealing them don&#039;t we? Yeah. Little devils. Had you garden before</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:03.530"> coming here? Had you gardened at home at all or in the past? No, only when I was on the farm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:10.890"> Right. I didn&#039;t roach. Used to drive a tractor then. Were you working there then? Yeah, living in.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:20.690"> Right. And they always grew some spuds did they? Yeah. In the field then? Yeah. And hay and</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:33.130"> straw. All right. Did you enjoy working there? Yeah. Well there. Yeah, it was all right. Yeah,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:42.630"> it was all right. So you came here with a lot of experience. You knew what was what sort of thing</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:49.290"> in terms of the tractors and gardening and what have you. Yeah. Do you think that coming here and</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:59.550"> the work you&#039;re doing keeps you fit? Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:06.350"> Do you ever, if you ever see the doctor, does he tell you you&#039;re a fit? You&#039;re doing well? Yeah,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:12.270"> I saw two not long ago. Lady doctor, she was going to test my legs but she said there&#039;s no need</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:18.670"> because I was fit. Oh well done. She&#039;ll check my toes and said they&#039;re fit. That&#039;s in case you get</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:25.510"> diabetes isn&#039;t it? Yeah. She said you get a small stand and put your feet up</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:31.990"> rather than down because it helps the veins in when your feet is up.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:38.930"> But she thought you were pretty good. Well it&#039;s bound to be. You&#039;re moving a lot during the day</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:44.630"> and I would imagine that helps then. Yeah. What&#039;s your favourite job here then, Brian?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:50.970"> Here? Yeah. No, anything.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:57.310"> Raking, digging, planting.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:06.070"> And is this a good time of year now? Yeah. I always think of you planting spuds, well not yet, but</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:13.670"> when will that be? A month&#039;s time? It&#039;s just the beginning of February now, is it March?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:20.290"> Depends on the weather, does it? Yeah, March, April, May.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:27.850"> Do you do first earlies? Yeah, we have done.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:34.370"> They&#039;re quite popular with people aren&#039;t they? Do people quite like</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:38.490"> to come and buy the first new potatoes? Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:42.510"> Yeah. You must have grown many pounds of spuds over the years. Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:51.150"> What would you say your favourite time of year was then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:55.470"> What would you say your favourite time of the year here is then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:02.480"> Planting. Is it? In the spring? May, April or May, March.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:17.120"> It&#039;s a nice pace of life. Yeah. You can&#039;t force nature. No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:30.160"> Shall we pause it there? Yeah. Pan? Just have a breather. Get the red light on again.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:40.840"> So continuing then Brian, you&#039;ve got your own, everybody has their own veg plot.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:47.300"> Vegetable plot, yeah. What are you going to grow on yours this year then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:54.680"> Probably potatoes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:58.940"> Anything else?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:05.220"> Beetroot plot.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:09.980"> So you get some produce from that. Yeah. What do you usually do with what you grow then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:16.920"> Where does it go to?

            <div class="transcript_container"><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:02.180"> Good afternoon, we&#039;re here this afternoon with Mr. Brian Quinlan, one of the longest attending gardeners at Stackpole Wall Garden.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:16.880"> We&#039;re interviewing him today which is the 2nd of February 2023 and this is part of the Citizen Curator project, an oral history project because people that have been working here and certainly very few for as long as Brian are able to tell us so much more about the gardens.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:39.900"> So I&#039;m working this afternoon with Julian Rollins, my colleague here who is the tutor.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:46.000"> So I&#039;m going to hand over and then we&#039;re going to have a bit of a chat.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:50.460"> Thank you, yeah. Thanks for giving us your time Brian because it&#039;s a busy day isn&#039;t it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:59.680"> When were you born Brian? When were you born? What year? 1939. Is that Cora now? Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:07.820"> So that&#039;s just as the second world war was starting. When the war was starting, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:13.300"> Where were you living then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:15.160"> As a child. Where did you live as a child? Outside Tenby, Gunferston.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:21.360"> Gunferston near Tenby, so you were alone.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:23.180"> The farm was down in the valleys. We had to go through a gate and then walk down to the farm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:32.520"> And your dad was the farmer? Yeah, my father was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:36.700"> Was that Astrich or what was the name of that farm? Can you remember the name? No, a long time ago.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:43.760"> I&#039;m not sure.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:45.160"> No, no. Gosh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:48.280"> So when you were small were you helping out around the farm then? Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:52.560"> What did they used to have you doing?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:54.880"> What did your dad used to ask you to do?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:58.440"> I know he was on the tractor and horses, ploughing with horses.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:05.900"> Then I went on the tractor after that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:09.140"> What age were you when you were driving the tractor? I don&#039;t know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:12.960"> Small?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:14.080"> Nine or ten.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:16.800"> That was quite something to have a tractor then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:19.480"> Because I remember my father telling me, you know, it was mainly horses, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:25.940"> Quite a thing to have a tractor.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:28.380"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:29.320"> Can you remember what tractor it was?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:31.980"> A Fordson Major, a small one.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:34.380"> Before they had the blue ones.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:36.940"> What colour would a Fordson be then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:39.620"> Blue.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:40.460"> Blue.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:41.520"> The big one, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:43.500"> So you, from a very young age then, you were working outdoors, doing outdoor stuff.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:49.580"> I was walking around with my father when he was ploughing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:52.600"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:53.260"> And with the tractor, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:55.540"> Can you remember the name of any of the horses?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:59.380"> We had two.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:00.960"> Did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:02.280"> A brown one with a white face.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:05.260"> And they used to use horses here at the garden, didn&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:08.640"> They did.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:09.540"> Before we were all around. There&#039;s a photo, isn&#039;t there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:12.100"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:13.900"> So when did you, can you remember when you first came here then, Brian?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:18.660"> When you first came to Stadpole?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:21.760"> I think when I went to the Anchorage first, I think.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:26.940"> Any idea what year that was?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:29.300"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:30.740"> So you&#039;re, how old are you now? You&#039;re 83.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:34.120"> Three.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:34.640"> Three, gosh, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:36.620"> 84 Monday week.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:38.300"> Oh, really? Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:39.540"> Did that go on there then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:40.800"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:42.160"> 84 Monday week.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:44.140"> And so what did you do between sort of finishing at the farm?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:50.300"> Were you working other places or?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:54.000"> I went to the golf refinery then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:57.440"> Oh, right, right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:58.780"> And I grew up working in the canteen.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:01.200"> Ah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:02.880"> Ah, so they&#039;ll have you in the kitchen if they hear that here.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:06.920"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:09.300"> So you think, would it, it would be a good idea to have a little bit of a</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:11.080"> little bit of a, would you have been around 50 when you started working here or older?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:18.300"> I&#039;m not sure, a bit older probably.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:20.500"> A bit older, yeah, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:22.520"> About 20 or so years ago probably, I suppose.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:26.000"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:26.200"> That&#039;s when, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:27.340"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:28.220"> Things really got going here.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:30.440"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:31.260"> Is there anyone else here now who was here when you first came?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:37.660"> I can&#039;t remember, no, I don&#039;t think so.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:40.040"> No, no.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:43.600"> No, so you really are the one that, you know what&#039;s what then, yes, okay.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:49.780"> So you said to me a little earlier that when you first came here the garden was in a bit</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:57.000"> of a state.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:57.900"> Oh, we&#039;ve grown here.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:59.480"> Yeah, what was it like?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:01.040"> What was growing in here?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:02.940"> A lot of nettles and brambles and trees.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:07.940"> Trees?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:08.880"> Yeah, small trees.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:10.000"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:10.020"> Big trees like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:11.620"> Wow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:13.320"> From the gate there, you couldn&#039;t open the gate, it was, well you opened the gate but</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:19.240"> it was full of brambles and nettles so we had to clear it all down.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:23.820"> Wow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:24.640"> So it was like clearing a jungle.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:26.460"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:28.260"> So that, was that the first job then, just cutting your way in?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:32.560"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:33.960"> How would, how did you do that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:36.540"> What sort of tools did you use, can you remember?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:40.740"> Saw, secateurs, clippers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:44.780"> No power tools, no strimmers back then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:48.080"> I can&#039;t remember.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:49.820"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:50.080"> Don&#039;t think so.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:52.500"> And was there a big gang of you then or was it just three or four?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:57.340"> A few of us.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:00.980"> And was Mr Bateman here then or?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:05.000"> Yes, George Bateman.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:06.640"> George Bateman, ah right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:09.120"> He was the head colonel then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:11.580"> Ah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:15.500"> And did you see many members of the public in those days?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:19.220"> Were there many visitors?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:22.600"> Yeah, I think there was a few walking around.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:25.140"> Right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:30.040"> So once he, once the place had been cleared, was the, were there the, the area that is</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:38.560"> now vegetable beds, was that the first bit that was cleared?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:43.320"> Yeah, we worked on them then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:46.660"> Do them over.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:49.420"> And were there, was there a greenhouse?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:53.340"> Hm?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:53.800"> Was there a greenhouse?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:56.320"> Yeah, there was, but I had one year then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:58.740"> Oh right, okay.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:02.060"> So you, do you remember that first sort of spring or whatever planting?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:07.480"> Was it, you know, quite something to fight, make enough space to do your planting?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:14.320"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:15.880"> What do you remember about that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:18.460"> Digging and, did you choose what to plant then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:22.680"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:26.800"> What did Mr Bateman tell you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:28.960"> Was it, who was making the decisions?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:30.600"> Digging in the tunnels.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:31.920"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:32.560"> For the tomatoes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:35.040"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:35.900"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:36.860"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:37.460"> So that was when you got the tunnels underway, was it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:40.980"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:41.560"> Just out here or?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:43.040"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:43.460"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:44.800"> So you, you grew tomatoes from an early, early stage then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:49.080"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:51.680"> Ah, right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:52.960"> And, and what else were you, were you growing back then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:55.520"> Hm?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:56.080"> What else were you growing back then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:59.420"> Can you remember?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:00.700"> Tomatoes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:01.420"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:03.560"> Onions, leeks, potatoes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:06.820"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:07.340"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:15.040"> And what were you, was that a, a small vegetable garden?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:17.240"> And did you, did you have a, did you have a small tractor?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:18.120"> Did you have that little tractor?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:18.860"> Was there a little tractor back there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:20.720"> Yeah, we had a small Fulton major.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:23.600"> Right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:25.180"> Was it the same as the one you&#039;d had at home?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:28.320"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:29.220"> No?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:30.540"> Small, grey one.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:32.080"> Ah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:32.620"> But you felt sort of okay about the tractor, obviously?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:36.760"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:37.240"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:37.420"> Yeah, yeah. And did you, how many times a week then did you come? Was it just once a week or?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:49.440"> I think it was, when we were clearing the garden.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:56.220"> And what was your general feeling? Did you, you know, want to come back? Did you find it satisfying to work here?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:04.060"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:07.420"> In what way then? Was it more like going back to your roots sort of thing?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:12.900"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:16.500"> Did it remind you of when you were a child on a farm?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:21.560"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:22.060"> No. The tractor and stuff, there wasn&#039;t.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:25.000"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:26.460"> So with the crops you were growing then, you were growing onions, potatoes, leeks, tomatoes, where did all of that produce go to?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:38.900"> I don&#039;t know. They used to take some veg into the shop in Halford West.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:43.240"> Oh, right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:44.200"> Next to the one, next to the pub I think. What was the name of that spa?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:53.980"> Oh, yeah. In Bridge Street in Halford West or?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:58.640"> No. In the town. Next to the King&#039;s Arms.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:03.020"> Ah, right. There you are. Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:04.340"> There was a shop there and they used to buy veg off us there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:10.340"> And I think you live in Halford West now, don&#039;t you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:13.140"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:13.320"> Were you living there then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:15.620"> When I was your age? No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:18.200"> No. I see. Because the charity Pembrokeshire Mencap was originally started off in Halford West, so I guess that&#039;s probably the link for selling the vegetables over there, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:34.780"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:35.340"> I think so.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:36.220"> Did you know Ian or, you know Ian that comes down?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:41.920"> From the committee?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:43.200"> Yeah. Did you know him then? Was he here then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:46.680"> I can&#039;t remember. I think he was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:49.040"> Probably did overlap, I should think. Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:51.560"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:52.880"> We can hear the blasting in the background.
