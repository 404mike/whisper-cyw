            <div class="transcript_container"><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:00.000"> Yes, can you please introduce yourself please?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:04.980"> My name is Raqel Smith.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:09.920"> Mera naam Raqel Smith hai.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:16.480"> Can you tell us where you were born and yeah, can you tell us about what it was like growing up there as well?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:23.280"> Mai Pakistan mein baida hui, Jannamwala, Nasti, Faisalabad ki.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:27.860"> I was born in Pakistan, Jannamwala, near Faisalabad, district Faisalabad.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:41.520"> What was it like growing up there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:47.840"> It was very nice. We had a small family.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:53.960"> My father was in England. He was in army first and then he came to England to work.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:04.800"> While I was with my mother, grandmother and brother.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:14.640"> So we were living there happily.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:20.180"> How old was you when your father was travelling to England?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:27.160"> We came to this country when I was fourteen.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:34.680"> What kind of games did you play in Pakistan?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:42.560"> I remember playing in the streets, sort of an open place.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:50.600"> Because even in the houses we have a yard where we play to get the children to come around.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:56.120"> And we played in the streets as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:59.680"> In our time it was very safe to play there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:05.420"> Have you got a favourite memory of your childhood?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:10.580"> My favourite memory could be my grandmother being there and friends coming around to play.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:21.060"> And we used to sit together, listen to grandmother&#039;s stories and having good fun really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:29.900"> Because there was no TV, only radio at that time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:36.260"> Is there a certain story you can remember from your grandmother?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:41.660"> Not really. Only remember just talking about different things.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:51.120"> Is there an event or gathering that really stands out to you that you had while you were still in Pakistan?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:00.480"> I remember Christmas times, because I&#039;m Christian.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:07.180"> So Christmas time was a big thing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:10.360"> And because my father was abroad we were known as a well-off family.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:18.280"> And he would send money and Christmas time all the people in our nearby would get together in our house.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:27.020"> And little presents would be given to them and it would be a really joyful time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:34.320"> Mixing with children. And it wasn&#039;t a massive big presents.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:38.340"> It was small presents and some food given and things like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:43.340"> So we weren&#039;t spoiled about giving of large big things.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:50.180"> So then you&#039;re 14 years old and you&#039;re travelling to the UK. What made you decide to come to the UK?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:59.040"> It was my father invited us over. The mother, my brother and myself.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:07.660"> It was hard in a sense. Mother was very excited. She&#039;s meeting her husband and going abroad.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:15.840"> I don&#039;t understand why I wasn&#039;t happy.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:20.480"> Because I was leaving everything I knew behind. I think all the aunty, uncles, all the friends behind.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:31.640"> But it was good as well. Happiness as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:35.600"> But still you were sad as well deep down living in the country.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:41.260"> Was there anything you were expecting? Did you have a vision inside your mind of what the UK was going to look like?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:47.300"> Not really, no. Being 14 years old it was quite hard to just think why we have to leave and go.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:58.980"> And when we came here, going to the school was the biggest thing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:05.280"> I didn&#039;t know the language. Even though I went to school in Pakistan, I only moved to India.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:12.900"> We just started doing English at my age. We started in class 6 I think.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:21.820"> We started English. And then I knew to read and write, but to speak there was no chance.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:34.540"> Especially when you can speak when you come here, accent and everything. It takes time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:44.140"> So that was a big culture.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:48.200"> So you travelled by plane coming to the UK?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:53.800"> Yes, we came by plane.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:55.880"> Can you remember where you landed?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:59.160"> Heathrow. Straight to Newport.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:03.920"> And been in Newport over 50 years now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:08.860"> Wow. That&#039;s amazing. Was there any particular reason why your father was in Newport?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:16.560"> He was actually in Bradford because he had friends there and there were more industrial factories around there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:27.300"> But he had a friend from Genoa where we were from, in Wales.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:35.440"> And he invited him over from Bradford. He said, come and join us here. Now your family is coming.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:42.240"> Come here so we can meet together. So that was the reason.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:49.240"> And of course, is there a certain memory that really sticks out to you when you arrived into Newport or around the time that you were settling in Newport?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:01.320"> Yes, there are a lot of memories. The particular one is changing of clothes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:08.500"> From Pakistani clothes we had to wear English clothes like in school, skirts and things. That was very daunting.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:21.200"> It was very strange after being covered, we had to wear those clothes. That was one of the memories that really sticks out.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:33.180"> That&#039;s something. That&#039;s the first time I&#039;m hearing that actually, someone mentioning that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:37.700"> Because you wouldn&#039;t think as much how clothes do pay a factor because that&#039;s what you&#039;re wearing at home.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:43.900"> That&#039;s what you&#039;re wearing when you play everywhere. Everyone in Pakistan is coming here.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:48.720"> It&#039;s not everyone. It&#039;s just my father was a thing who got mixed with the culture.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:56.560"> And being a Christian, we didn&#039;t have restrictions like got to be covered.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:05.220"> Even though in Pakistan there was no difference. That&#039;s what you call national costume.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:14.120"> Here to him, national costume was what English people were wearing. Got to be with the society.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:24.280"> So when did you start learning more about the language?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:29.600"> I went to school here. So I started learning the language there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:36.700"> There were special classes and there were Pakistani children as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:41.220"> With the teachers I would communicate small words by writing down and answering back written down.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:48.800"> They would write down for me. There was no other help around.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:55.980"> So how about friends? Did you start growing friends as well or more that you have been settled in the side of Newport?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:01.740"> Yes, we made friendship. My main friends were Pakistani people because of the language.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:09.520"> And some of them are still my friends. We kept on as family friends after.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:19.940"> Where in Newport have you lived actually? Since you&#039;ve been here for 50 years.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:25.360"> I live around the hand post area, you know, Rusker Road.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:31.500"> We moved around a bit. I think the very first time we came, the first home was in Thill.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:39.380"> My father was there and from there we moved to Mendy. We lived in Mendy a year.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:44.980"> And then the rest of my life I&#039;ve been in the hand post area, up and down streets.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:53.000"> You&#039;re actually quite high up now actually going up the hand post.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:57.540"> Does that mean that you used to go to Bellevue Park and things like that as well?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:01.220"> Yes, I lived in Bellevue Park and still do. It&#039;s one of the things, really memories are there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:09.160"> Because from school we would walk to Bellevue Park before we go home.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:12.920"> I went to Dufferin High. Bellevue Park is quite an important park in my life.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:25.840"> After coming here, did any of your friends from Pakistan or other family members join you in Newport?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:32.640"> No. Because it wasn&#039;t easy to get visas and things.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:41.560"> How about you travelling to Pakistan? Have you been able to?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:47.420"> My mum and my husband used to go more often. My husband doesn&#039;t come yet.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:55.360"> He came too early. When I got married I went back. I did not go before that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:04.300"> Yes, we got a big connection at this moment in Pakistan. We started a charity in a village nearby where I&#039;m from.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:14.420"> Which is running a school for poor children in a small village.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:20.640"> And they needed a church as well so we built up a church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:24.240"> School is our responsibility. I got all the community here involved in it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:29.980"> It&#039;s good really well. We got a big connection there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:35.140"> We go up and down and with the media now we run the video calls.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:41.640"> So it&#039;s really important. When I was young I didn&#039;t have that connection.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:50.740"> Only stories I will get is when mum will go back or my husband will go back.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:60.000"> But now I&#039;ve been a few times.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:04.580"> What does that connection feel like for you to have now?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:07.980"> It&#039;s that connection you didn&#039;t have when you were younger.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:10.020"> What does it feel to have that now and to also provide it for other people?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:13.600"> It is really satisfying the connection.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:17.900"> It&#039;s keeping in touch with your roots.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:21.300"> Plus we&#039;re trying to change lives of people.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:24.460"> We&#039;ve got a good life here and those children did not have any education, no school.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:32.100"> And it is really satisfactory that you can make a change in people&#039;s lives.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:41.140"> When we were asked to do something for the village,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:45.240"> I&#039;m not from the village or my husband is not,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:49.120"> it was just a pastor who reached us and asked us if we can help.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:54.700"> Because they think people living abroad are rich and they can do anything.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:59.820"> But we said we will go back and find out and let you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:03.540"> So we took up this responsibility and God is always there to help us through.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:10.080"> Because fundraising is not a easy job.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:13.760"> And we are getting there and we got the building which is really lovely.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:18.600"> And children seeing their behaviour running around from the street to being here,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:25.400"> sitting down to get some education, this we&#039;re changing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:29.240"> For the country, these children and changing their families,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:34.920"> it&#039;s a really satisfying project.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:39.760"> And like I said, all my friends, everybody I know is always willing to help.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:47.520"> The fundraising, anything they can do, it&#039;s always there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:52.640"> It&#039;s amazing to hear and that togetherness that you just mentioned of your friends</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:58.020"> and people that are around you here, they&#039;re also assisting you in fundraising.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:03.100"> This is without any religion, without any restrictions.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:07.160"> We are just friends. We try to work for this community.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:13.540"> And speaking of work, what type of jobs have you had while you&#039;ve been here in Newport?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:20.620"> I have worked in shops, like shop assistants.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:29.660"> I think little time in the factory as well, the production factory.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:34.760"> But my main job has been in school as a language support worker and an under-five development worker.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:43.420"> And I think that&#039;s where my real heart is to see children progress.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:48.880"> And get into life. Education is the only way, I believe, to change people, to give you progress.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:58.040"> And I&#039;ve done a lot of work. Since I retired, I&#039;m a voluntary worker.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:06.900"> And can you tell us a bit more about your family in terms of your husband,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:11.600"> and how that came about, and then growing up from there as well, in terms of you being married?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:20.700"> Yes, I was married at the age of 31.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:26.380"> And it was arranged, married.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:30.060"> And we have lived happily since then. It&#039;s 47 years now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:35.180"> We&#039;ve got three girls who are very successfully educated and settled in their life.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:44.540"> And six grandchildren. It can be helpful when they&#039;re together.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:53.960"> So then balancing your work and family and being in this environment as well,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:01.500"> what kind of other things in terms of groups or anything like that did you start being exposed to?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:07.540"> Or did you start joining any groups while you were here in Newport?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:14.820"> Basically I joined the groups when I retired.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:23.020"> I was looking for a way to go, what to do. I started going to coffee and laugh at Eaton Road.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:28.580"> And from there a friend, Sugra, introduced me to Age Alive.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:34.500"> And Age Alive is a very successful, very friendly, satisfying, it&#039;s like a family group now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:51.620"> Because I&#039;ve been going to it till about ten years.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:54.460"> So I can make up places. And I&#039;m a secretary for the group.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:02.880"> Once you&#039;re with Age Alive, you always got a job there. They get you to do everything.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:09.740"> Roy who runs Age Alive is a person who gives his 100% to it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:18.400"> And he expects everybody else to give their life to it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:22.800"> But I do try my best and try to do what I can.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:28.580"> But it is a group that everybody should join. It&#039;s so satisfying.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:37.780"> It&#039;s given people a home. Like some people go nobody.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:42.780"> Once they join Age Alive, you&#039;ve got a family there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:47.500"> We were really friends with everybody. Everybody&#039;s willing to help.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:55.540"> Fantastic. Thank you. Thank you very much. I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s anything else that you would like to share at all.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:04.160"> That&#039;s all really. Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:09.000"> Fantastic. Thank you very much.</div></div><br>

What kind of games did you play in Pakistan?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:42.440"> I remember playing in the streets, sort of an open place.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:50.040"> Because even in the houses we have a yard where we play together, children come around.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:55.260"> And we play in the streets as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:59.040"> In our time it was very safe to play there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:02.920"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:05.160"> Have you got a favourite memory of your childhood?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:11.260"> My favourite memory could be my grandmother being there and friends coming around to play.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:20.120"> And we used to sit together, listen to grandmother&#039;s stories.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:26.820"> And having good fun really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:29.740"> Because there was no TV, only radio at that time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:36.160"> Is there a certain story you can remember from your grandmother?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:41.180"> Not really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:43.680"> Only remember.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:44.940"> Just talking about different things.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:50.600"> And...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:51.220"> And is there an event?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:54.000"> An event or a gathering that really stands out to you that you had while you were still in Pakistan?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:59.820"> I remember Christmas times.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:04.180"> Because I&#039;m Christian.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:06.480"> So, Christmas time was a big thing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:10.280"> And because my father was abroad, we were known as a well-off family.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:17.200"> And he would send the money.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:19.900"> And Christmas time, all the people in our room, nearby, would get together in our house.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:27.060"> And little presents were given to them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:29.120"> And it would be really a joyful time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:33.860"> Mixing with children.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:35.000"> And it wasn&#039;t a massive, big presents.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:37.940"> It was small presents and some food given and things like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:42.900"> So, we weren&#039;t spoiling up large, big things.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:50.280"> So then, you&#039;re 14 years old.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:53.840"> And you&#039;re travelling to the UK.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:56.200"> What made you decide to come to the UK?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:58.680"> It was my father and my tata Soba.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:02.280"> The mother, my brother and myself.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:07.220"> It was hard in a sense.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:09.360"> The mother was very excited.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:11.120"> She was meeting her husband and going abroad.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:16.120"> I don&#039;t understand why I wasn&#039;t happy.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:19.980"> Because I was leaving everything I knew behind.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:23.000"> I think all the aunty, uncles, all the friends behind.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:31.600"> But, it was good as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:33.640"> Happiness as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:35.120"> But still, you were sad as well, deep down.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:38.000"> Living the country.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:41.200"> Was there anything you were expecting?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:43.340"> Did you have a vision inside your mind of what the UK was going to look like?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:47.100"> Not really, no.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:49.800"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:50.940"> Being 40 year old, it was quite hard to just think why we have to leave and go.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:58.500"> And when we came here, going to the school was the biggest thing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:05.420"> I didn&#039;t know the language.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:08.560"> Even though I went to school in Pakistan, but it was all in Uttu.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:12.740"> And we just started doing English at my age.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:16.200"> And then, you started in class 6, I think.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:21.580"> You started English.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:24.240"> And then, I knew a bit to read and write.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:30.460"> But to speak, there was no chance.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:34.540"> Especially, even if you can speak, when you come here, accent and everything.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:38.420"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:39.660"> Really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:40.680"> It takes time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:43.100"> I agree.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:43.980"> So, that was a big 12th of our world.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:48.460"> So, you travelled by plane, coming to the UK.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:52.320"> It was by plane?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:53.940"> Yeah, we came by plane.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:55.740"> Where did you, can you remember where you landed?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:58.460"> Where did you arrive?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:59.140"> Heathrow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:00.020"> Okay.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:00.640"> Heathrow and straight to Newport.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:03.060"> Okay.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:03.840"> I&#039;ve been in Newport over 50 years now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:07.560"> Wow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:10.220"> That&#039;s amazing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:11.460"> And was there any particular reason why your father was in Newport?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:14.960"> Or why you came to Newport?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:16.480"> Yeah, he was actually in Bradford.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:19.480"> Because he had friends there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:20.980"> And they were more, I think, industrial factories around there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:27.200"> But he had a friend from Jornawala, where we&#039;re from, in Wales.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:34.880"> And he invited him over from Bradford.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:38.260"> He said, come and join us here.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:39.740"> Now your family is coming.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:41.920"> Come here so we can meet together.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:44.400"> So that was the reason.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:49.280"> And, of course, is there a certain memory that really sticks out to you when you arrived</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:55.160"> into Newport?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:56.200"> Or around the time that you were settling in Newport?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:00.920"> Yes, there are a lot of memories.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:02.980"> Yes, there are a lot of memories.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:03.040"> The particular one is changing of clothes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:08.640"> From Pakistani clothes, we had to wear English clothes, like in school skirt and things.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:17.980"> That was very daunting.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:20.580"> It was very strange after being covered.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:24.780"> You having to wear those clothes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:28.260"> That was one of the memories.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:30.040"> It really sticks out.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:32.880"> Yeah, that&#039;s something.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:34.220"> That&#039;s the first time I&#039;m hearing that actually.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:35.900"> Someone mentioning that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:37.000"> Because you wouldn&#039;t think as much how clothes do pay a factor.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:42.000"> Because that&#039;s what you&#039;re wearing at home.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:43.900"> That&#039;s what you&#039;re wearing when you play everywhere.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:45.740"> Everyone you&#039;re in Pakistan is that come in here.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:47.920"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:48.480"> It&#039;s not everyone.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:50.000"> It&#039;s just my father was a...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:53.520"> I think you got to mix with the culture.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:57.220"> And being a Christian, we didn&#039;t have restrictions like you got to be covered.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:04.860"> Even though in Pakistan there was no difference.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:08.620"> Because that&#039;s what you call...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:10.720"> National costume.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:14.340"> Here, to him, national costume was what English people were wearing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:20.100"> And got to be with the society.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:24.500"> So when did you start kind of learning more about the language?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:29.200"> I went to school here.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:31.420"> So I started learning the language there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:33.840"> And there were special classes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:38.300"> And there were Pakistani children as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:41.140"> And with the teachers I would communicate small words by writing down.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:46.640"> And answering back, written down.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:48.840"> They would write down for me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:50.380"> And there was no other help around.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:55.480"> So how about friends?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:56.860"> Did you start kind of growing friends as well?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:58.720"> Or are the more that you have been settled inside of Newport?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:00.740"> Yes, we made friendship.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:04.000"> My main friends were Pakistani people because of the language.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:09.060"> And some of them are still my friends.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:12.720"> We kept on as family friends after.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:19.240"> Where in Newport have you lived actually?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:22.180"> Since you&#039;ve been here for 50 years.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:25.280"> I live around the Han Post area, you know, Ruska Road.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:29.920"> Around there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:31.200"> Well, we moved around a bit.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:33.700"> I think the very first time we came, the first home was in Pill.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:39.080"> My father was there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:40.680"> And then from there we moved to Mendy.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:43.420"> We lived in the Mendy a year.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:45.040"> And then the rest of my life been in the Han Post area.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:48.820"> Up and down the streets.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:52.540"> Yeah, because you&#039;re quite high up now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:54.300"> You&#039;re actually going up the Han Post.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:57.520"> Does that mean that you used to kind of go to Bellevue Park and things like that as well?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:01.200"> Yeah, I lived to Bellevue Park and still do.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:04.360"> It&#039;s one of the...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:07.020"> I think really memories are there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:09.000"> Because from school we will walk to the Bellevue Park before we go home.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:12.760"> I went to different hall.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:16.100"> So Bellevue Park is quite an important park in my life.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:24.700"> So, after coming here did any of your friends from Pakistan or even family, other family members join you in Newport?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:32.440"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:33.080"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:33.580"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:33.840"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:34.940"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:35.760"> Because it wasn&#039;t easy to get visas and things.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:39.360"> So...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:41.560"> How about you travelling to Pakistan?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:44.420"> Have you been able to...?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:47.080"> Yes, mum and my husband used to go more often.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:51.680"> But the husband doesn&#039;t come yet.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:53.580"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:54.920"> Came too early.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:56.580"> Yeah, but I got married.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:57.500"> When I got married, I went back.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:00.440"> I did not go before that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:04.300"> Yes, we got a big connection at this moment in Pakistan.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:07.660"> We started a charity.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:09.940"> We are in a village nearby where I am from.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:13.940"> Which is running a school for poor children in a small village.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:18.960"> And they needed a church as well, so they built up a church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:24.360"> The school is our responsibility.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:26.540"> I got all the community here involved in it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:29.320"> And it&#039;s good really well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:32.100"> So we got a big connection there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:35.040"> We go up and down.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:36.180"> And with the media now, we&#039;re on the video calls.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:40.020"> And so it&#039;s really important.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:45.360"> When I was young, I didn&#039;t have that connection.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:50.700"> Only stories I would get is when mum will go back or my husband will go back.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:59.960"> But now I&#039;ve been through times.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:04.440"> What does that connection feel like for you to have now?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:07.880"> That connection that you didn&#039;t have when you were younger,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:10.040"> what does it feel to have that now and to also provide it for other people?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:13.420"> It is really satisfying that the connection is.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:17.820"> It&#039;s keeping in touch with your roots.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:21.160"> And plus we&#039;re trying to change lives of people.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:24.040"> We&#039;ve got a good life here.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:25.880"> And those children did not have any education, no school.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:31.340"> And it is really satisfactory that you can make a change in people&#039;s life.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:38.940"> And the project, when we were asked to do something for the village,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:44.380"> and I&#039;m not from the village or my husband&#039;s not.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:48.560"> And it was just a pastor who reached us and asked us if we can help.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:54.260"> Because they think people living abroad are rich.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:57.500"> And they can do anything.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:59.380"> But we said we will go back and find out and let you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:03.640"> So we took up this responsibility and God is always there to help us through.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:08.760"> Because fundraising is not an easy job.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:13.120"> And we are getting there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:14.760"> And we got the building, which is really lovely.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:17.920"> And children seeing their behaviour running around from the street to being,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:24.500"> sitting down to get some education.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:27.070"> And this will change for the country, these children and changing their families.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:34.810"> It&#039;s a really satisfying project.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:39.010"> And this, like I said, all my friends, everybody you know,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:44.430"> is always willing to help.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:46.710"> The fundraising, anything they can do.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:49.930"> It&#039;s always there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:52.450"> It&#039;s amazing, amazing to hear.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:54.570"> And that togetherness that you just mentioned of your friends and people that are around you here,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:59.910"> also assisting you in fundraising.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:03.170"> This is without any religion, without any restrictions.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:06.690"> We are just friends.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:08.470"> We try to work for this community.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:13.130"> And speaking of work, what type of jobs have you kind of had while you&#039;ve been here in Newport?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:20.370"> I have worked in shops, like shop assistants.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:28.830"> I think little time in the factory as well, the production factory.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:34.270"> But my main job, being in school, as a language support worker,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:40.610"> and under 512 worker.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:42.910"> And I think that&#039;s where my real heart is, to see children progress.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:48.770"> And get into life.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:50.510"> Education is the only way, I believe, to change people.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:55.090"> Give you progress.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:57.550"> And I tend a lot of, since I retired, I&#039;m a volunteer worker.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:06.990"> And can you tell us a bit more about your family in terms of your husband,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:12.890"> and how that came about, and then growing up from there as well, in terms of you being married?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:20.590"> Yes, I was married at the age of 21.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:25.830"> And I was arranged married.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:29.350"> And we have lived happily since then, and it&#039;s 47 years now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:35.450"> We&#039;ve got three girls, who are very successfully educated and settled in their life.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:43.330"> And six grandchildren.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:47.890"> Can be handful when they&#039;re together.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:53.330"> So then, balancing your work, and family, and being in this environment as well,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:01.670"> what kind of other things in terms of groups or anything like that did you start being exposed to,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:07.370"> or did you start joining any groups, yeah, at all while you were here in Newport?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:14.750"> Basically, I joined the groups when I retired.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:20.170"> And, I was looking for a way to go, what to do.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:25.750"> I started to go into Coffee and Love at Eaton Road.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:28.670"> And from there, a friend, Sucra, introduced me to Age Alive.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:33.970"> And Age Alive is a very successful, very friendly, satisfying.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:49.510"> It&#039;s like a family group now, because I&#039;ve been going to it for about 10 years.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:55.150"> So I can make places.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:58.770"> And I&#039;m a secretary for the group.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:02.370"> Once you&#039;re with Age Alive, you always got a job there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:06.430"> They get you to do everything.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:09.550"> Roy, who runs Age Alive, is a person who gives his 100% to it,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:17.770"> and he expects everybody else to give their life to it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:22.650"> But I do try my best and try to do what I can.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:28.010"> But it is a group that everybody should join.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:35.650"> It&#039;s so satisfying.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:37.630"> It&#039;s given people a home.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:38.870"> Like, some people got nobody.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:42.070"> And once they join Age Alive, you got a family there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:47.390"> We were really friends with everybody.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:50.970"> Everybody&#039;s willing to help.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:55.050"> Fantastic.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:55.970"> Thank you.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:56.450"> Thank you very much.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:57.190"> I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s anything else that you would like to share at all.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:03.870"> That&#039;s all, really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:05.690"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line"

We had a small family.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:53.900"> My father was...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:57.340"> in England.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:59.340"> He was in army first and then he came to England to work.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:04.520"> While I was with my mother, grandmother and brother.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:14.040"> So we were living there happily.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:20.160"> How old was you when your father was travelling to England?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:26.440"> How old was you when your father was travelling to England?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:27.320"> We came to this country when I was 14.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:33.560"> What do you remember? What kind of games did you play in Pakistan?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:42.440"> I remember playing in the streets, sort of an open place.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:50.000"> Because even in the houses we have a yard where we play together, children come around.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:55.140"> And we play in the streets as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:59.040"> In our time it was very safe to play there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:04.920"> Have you got a favourite memory of your childhood?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:10.660"> My favourite memory could be my grandmother being there and friends coming around to play.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:20.360"> And we used to sit together and listen to grandmother&#039;s stories.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:26.020"> And having good fun really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:29.380"> Because there was no TV or radio at that time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:35.980"> Is there a certain story you can remember from your grandmother?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:40.960"> Not really. No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:43.100"> I only remember just talking about different things.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:50.260"> And is there an event? An event that you remember?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:54.640"> An event or a gathering that really stands out to you that you had while you were still in Pakistan?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:59.800"> I remember Christmas times.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:03.980"> Because I&#039;m Christian.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:06.240"> So Christmas time was a big thing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:10.100"> And because my father was abroad, we were known as a well-off family.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:17.700"> And he would send money.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:19.360"> And Christmas time, all the people in our room nearby,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:24.480"> all the people in our room nearby,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:24.620"> would get together in our house and little presents were given to them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:28.880"> And it would be really a joyful time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:33.780"> Mixing with children.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:34.920"> And it wasn&#039;t a massive big presents.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:37.640"> It was small presents and some fruit given and things like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:42.820"> So we weren&#039;t spoiled or given large big things.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:50.200"> So then, you&#039;re 14 years old.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:53.440"> And you&#039;re travelling to the UK.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:56.040"> What made you decide to come to the UK?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:58.600"> It was my father and my titus over.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:01.980"> The mother, my brother and myself.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:07.160"> It was hard in a sense.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:09.440"> Mother was very excited.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:10.980"> She&#039;s meeting her husband and going abroad.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:15.980"> I don&#039;t understand why I wasn&#039;t happy.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:19.880"> Because I was leaving everything I knew behind, I think.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:23.140"> All the aunties, uncles, all the friends behind.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:28.620"> But it was good as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:33.500"> Happiness as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:34.980"> But still it was sad as well, deep down.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:37.680"> Leaving the country.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:41.020"> Was there anything you were expecting?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:43.240"> Did you have a vision inside your mind of what the UK was going to look like?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:47.080"> Not really, no.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:50.480"> Being 14 years old, it was quite a...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:52.980"> It was hard to just think why we have to leave and go.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:58.420"> And when we came here, going to the school was the biggest thing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:05.340"> I didn&#039;t know the language.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:08.360"> Even though I went to school in Pakistan, but it was all in Urdu.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:12.560"> And we just started doing English at my age.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:16.260"> You start in class six, I think.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:22.980"> English.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:24.180"> And then...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:27.180"> I knew a bit to read and write.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:30.360"> But to speak, there was no chance.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:34.360"> Especially even if you can speak when you come here, accent and everything.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:39.320"> Really, it takes time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:42.860"> I agree.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:43.880"> So that was a big, big superpower.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:47.960"> So then, so you travelled by plane, coming to the UK.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:51.780"> It was by plane?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:53.700"> Yeah, we came by plane.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:55.320"> Where did you...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:56.580"> Can you remember where you landed?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:58.940"> Heathrow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:00.480"> Heathrow and straight to Newport.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:03.400"> I&#039;ve been in Newport over 50 years now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:07.980"> Wow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:10.200"> That&#039;s amazing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:11.200"> And was there any particular reason why your father was in Newport?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:14.700"> Or why you came to Newport?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:16.380"> Yeah, he was actually in Bradford because he had friends there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:20.620"> And they were more, I think, industrial factories around there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:27.100"> But he had a friend from Johnawalla, where we&#039;re from, in Wales.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:34.980"> And he invited him over from Bradford.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:38.020"> He said, come and join us here.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:39.580"> Now your family is coming.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:41.700"> Come here so we can meet together.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:44.240"> So that was the reason.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:47.660"> And of course, you were...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:50.600"> Is there a certain memory that really sticks out to you when you arrived into Newport?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:56.000"> Or around the time that you were settling in Newport?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:01.000"> Yes, there are a lot of memories.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:02.740"> The particular one is changing of clothes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:08.720"> From Pakistani clothes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:10.360"> We had to wear English clothes, like in school, skirt and things.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:17.940"> That was very daunting.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:20.600"> It was very strange after being covered.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:24.640"> We had to wear those clothes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:28.120"> That was one of the memories that really sticks out.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:33.000"> Yeah, that&#039;s something.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:34.140"> That&#039;s the first time I&#039;m hearing that actually.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:35.820"> Someone mentioning that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:36.800"> Because you wouldn&#039;t think as much how clothes do play a factor.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:42.040"> Because that&#039;s what you&#039;re wearing at home.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:43.620"> That&#039;s what you&#039;re wearing when you play everywhere.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:45.620"> Everyone, you know, Pakistanis, they&#039;re coming here.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:47.660"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:47.960"> It&#039;s not everyone.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:49.880"> It&#039;s just my father was...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:52.940"> I think you got to mix with the culture.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:56.960"> And being a Christian, we didn&#039;t have restrictions like you got to be covered.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:04.620"> Even though in Pakistan there was no difference.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:08.540"> Because that&#039;s what you call national costume.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:14.200"> Here, to him, national costume was what he wanted.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:17.960"> And to him, it was one of the käyttig.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:24.300"> Now, many of us are dressed like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:28.780"> So, we thought we should dress like this.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:33.960"> So, it was kind of like, not like the...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:37.540"> This is like wearing clothes, old European outfit.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:40.420"> Thank you very much for your time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:47.940"> written down. They would write down for me and there was no other help around.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:55.340"> So how about friends? Did you start kind of growing friends as well or the more that you</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:59.140"> were being settled inside of Newport? Yes, we made friendship. My main friends were Pakistani</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:06.180"> people because of the language and some of them are still my friends. We kept on</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:14.640"> as family friends after. Where in Newport have you lived actually, since you&#039;ve been here for 50 years?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:24.860"> I live around the Hanpost area, you know, Ruska road. We moved around a bit.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:33.900"> I think very first time we came, the first home was in Pill, my father was there and then</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:40.780"> from there we moved to Mendy.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:43.640"> lived in the main area and then the rest of my life I&#039;ve been in the hand post area, up</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:49.220"> and down streets.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:52.540"> Yeah, because you&#039;re quite high up now actually, going up the hand post.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:57.220"> Does that mean that you used to go to Bellevue Park and things like that as well?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:00.940"> Yeah, I lived at Bellevue Park and still do.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:04.340"> It&#039;s one of the things, really memories are there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:08.860"> Because from school we would walk to the Bellevue Park before we go home.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:12.700"> I went to Dufferin High.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:16.000"> So Bellevue Park is quite an important park in my life.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:23.940"> So after coming here, did any of your friends from Pakistan or even family, other family</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:29.780"> members join you in Newport?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:32.940"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:35.240"> Because it wasn&#039;t easy to get visas and things.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:41.460"> How about you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:42.700"> Have you travelled to Pakistan?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:44.520"> Have you been able to?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:47.100"> My mum and my husband used to go more often.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:51.520"> But my husband hasn&#039;t come yet.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:54.280"> He came too early.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:56.700"> But when I got married I went back.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:00.360"> I did not go before that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:04.220"> Yes, we got a big connection at this moment in Pakistan.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:07.800"> We started a charity.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:09.800"> There is an inner village nearby.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:11.860"> Where I&#039;m from.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:13.860"> Which is running a school for poor children in a small village.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:19.260"> And they needed a church as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:22.240"> So they built up a church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:24.260"> A school is our responsibility.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:26.400"> I got all the community here involved in it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:29.160"> And it&#039;s going really well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:31.960"> So we got a big connection there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:34.460"> We go up and down.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:35.900"> And with the media now, we&#039;re on the video calls.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:39.820"> And so it&#039;s good.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:41.840"> It&#039;s really important.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:45.340"> When I was young, I didn&#039;t have that connection.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:50.440"> The only stories I will get is when mum will go back.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:53.540"> Or my husband will go back.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:59.940"> But now I&#039;ve been a few times.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:04.340"> What does that connection feel like for you to have now?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:07.460"> Is it a connection that you didn&#039;t have when you were younger?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:09.940"> What does it feel to have that now?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:11.600"> And to also provide it for other people?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:14.000"> It is really satisfying, the connection is.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:17.720"> It&#039;s keeping in touch with your roots.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:20.680"> And plus, we&#039;re trying to change lives of people.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:23.820"> We&#039;ve got a good life here.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:25.900"> And those children did not have any education.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:29.880"> No school.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:31.820"> And it is really satisfactory.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:35.680"> That you can make a change in people&#039;s life.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:38.900"> And the project.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:39.960"> And the project.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:41.060"> When we were asked to do something for the village.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:44.780"> And I&#039;m not from the village.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:46.740"> Or my husband&#039;s not.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:48.540"> And it was just a pastor reached us.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:51.360"> And asked us if we can help.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:54.280"> Because they think people living abroad are rich.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:57.200"> And they can do anything.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:59.420"> But we said we will go back and find out.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:02.100"> And let you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:03.520"> So we took up this responsibility.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:05.660"> And God is always there to help us through.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:08.660"> Because fundraising is not an easy job.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:12.940"> And we are getting there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:14.480"> And we got the building.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:15.780"> Which is really lovely.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:17.360"> And the children seeing their behavior.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:21.540"> Running around from the street.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:23.440"> To being, sitting down to get some education.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:27.520"> This we&#039;re changing for the country.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:30.800"> These children and changing their families.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:34.700"> It&#039;s really satisfying project.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:39.060"> And this, like I said.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:40.900"> All my friends.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:43.200"> Everybody I know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:44.340"> Is always willing to help.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:46.760"> With fundraising.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:47.880"> Or anything they can do.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:50.180"> It&#039;s always there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:52.460"> It&#039;s amazing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:53.380"> Amazing to hear.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:54.320"> And that togetherness that you just mentioned.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:56.880"> Your friends and people that are around you here.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:59.900"> And also assisting you.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:01.300"> In fundraising.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:02.860"> This is without any religion.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:04.520"> Without any restrictions.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:06.620"> We are just friends.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:07.940"> We try to work for this community.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:12.900"> And speaking of work.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:15.160"> What type of jobs have you kind of had.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:17.620"> While you&#039;ve been here in Newport?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:20.440"> I have worked in shops.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:25.840"> Like shop assistants.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:28.840"> I think little time in a factory as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:31.820"> Production factory.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:34.120"> But my main job.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:35.680"> Being in school.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:36.580"> As a language support worker.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:39.980"> And a under five development worker.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:42.740"> And I think that&#039;s where my real heart is.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:45.640"> To see children progress.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:48.400"> And get into life.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:50.400"> Education is the only way I believe.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:52.380"> To change people.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:54.400"> To give you progress.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:57.320"> And I&#039;ve done a lot of.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:59.520"> Since I retired.</div><div class="transcript_line"

class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:06.580"> And can you tell us a bit more about your family.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:09.840"> In terms of your husband.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:12.140"> And then how that came about.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:14.440"> And then growing up from there as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:15.940"> In terms of you being married.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:20.460"> Yes I was married at the age of 31.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:25.700"> And it was arranged marriage.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:29.160"> And we have lived happily since then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:32.940"> And it&#039;s 47 years now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:34.740"> And we have three daughters.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:35.780"> We have three girls.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:37.080"> Who are very successfully educated.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:40.520"> And.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:42.000"> Settling their life.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:43.800"> And six grandchildren.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:47.760"> Can be hurtful when they&#039;re together.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:53.160"> So then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:54.820"> Balancing your work.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:57.220"> And family.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:58.720"> And being in this environment as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:01.400"> What kind of other things.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:02.740"> In terms of groups.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:03.740"> Or anything like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:05.040"> Did you start.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:06.200"> Being exposed to or did you start joining any groups.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:09.180"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:09.500"> So while you were here in Newport.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:14.420"> Basically I joined the groups when I retired.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:18.340"> And.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:22.940"> I was looking for where to go.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:24.860"> What to do.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:25.640"> I started to go into coffee and laugh at Eton Road.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:28.540"> And from there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:29.740"> A friend.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:30.920"> Sookra.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:31.840"> Introduced me to Rachel Life.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:33.820"> And Rachel Life is a very.</div><div class="transcript_line"

class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:47.460"> Satisfying.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:49.400"> It&#039;s like a family group now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:51.560"> Because I&#039;ve been going to it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:52.680"> For about ten years.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:54.880"> So I can make a place.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:58.360"> And I&#039;m a secretary for the group.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:02.280"> Once you&#039;re with Rachel Life.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:03.860"> You always got a job there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:05.860"> They get you to do everything.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:09.180"> Roy.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:09.980"> Who runs Rachel Life.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:13.060"> Is a.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:15.000"> Person who gives his 100% to it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:17.620"> And he expects everybody else to be.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:21.160"> Give their life to it.</div><div class="transcript_line"

is a group that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:30.460"> Everybody should join.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:32.780"> It&#039;s.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:35.740"> It&#039;s so satisfying.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:37.440"> It&#039;s given people a home.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:39.140"> Like.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:40.240"> Some people got nobody.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:42.400"> Once they join.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:43.980"> Rachel Life.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:45.020"> You got a family there.</div><div class="transcript_line"
