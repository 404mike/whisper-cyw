And I was born at 31 Herbert Avenue,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:02.820"> Riske. Um. As I say my mother was a farmer&#039;s daughter and my father was doing works you</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:11.480"> know. And um we moved from there then to Park Place at Riske and we lived there for quite</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:17.740"> a few years. And then we moved from there then and took the farm at Langorse. And that</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:23.200"> was uh nineteen... what was it? Nineteen... nine. Nineteen. Nineteen. Nineteen. Nineteen.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:25.480"> Oh dear. Nineteen... forty-six. Forty-seven. That&#039;s right.

Um. And then I moved to Newport. Was that in Newport? Uh Riske.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:57.640"> Ah. Pontymyster Riske. Yeah. Um. So he wasn&#039;t a farmer at all? No. No. No. Um. And then</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:05.380"> he had his sister Evelyn Mary Thomas and she was forty-four years in Riske at a radio...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:11.940"> an electrical shop. Ah. ùêÖùêÜùêçùêçùêçùêçùêçùêç. And then his other sister Auntie Phyllis,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:16.360"> Phyllis Thomas. She was a teacher. And um up in Abercarne. And um they lived in uh...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:25.880"> uh... oh I&#039;ve got to think of the name of the place now. Oh dear that&#039;s terrible isn&#039;t</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:30.420"> it? Uh they lived in um Woodland Drive in Rodgestone.

You</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:39.760"> don&#039;t? No. No. You go up through Woodland Drive, uh Rodgestone up to Riske and then</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:43.680"> of course you carry on up the valley then. So your... your mother was from a farming</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:47.620"> background? Yes. Yes. And where was she from? Newhouse Farm Panteig near Pontypool. Okay.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:53.000"> One near Wynne it was really. Um. Um. And she was a farmer. Um. And she was a farmer.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:54.340"> Um. So how did she meet your father? Uh well I think my gran... my um grandparents on my</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:01.360"> mother&#039;s side... father&#039;s side lived in New Inn. And I think my daddy used to go back</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:07.220"> and forth you know to see them and that —Ñow they met I suppose. It&#039;s funny how people</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:11.020"> do meet don&#039;t they? Um. So your father had to learn how to be a farmer then presumably?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:16.140"> Yes he was always interested. His... his... his cousin used to keep the Mardie Farm, Kerkurnu</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:20.140"> just below the Kerkurnu uh golf course. Yes. And uh... um... he was a farmer. He was a</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:24.340"> farmer. He was a farmer. He was a farmer. And uh he spent a lot of time there. So that</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:26.900"> um you know he really got fed up with the uh as the saying is in the steelworks. So</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:32.520"> he thought they&#039;d branch out and uh they had this farm in Langorse then. And we took that</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:36.680"> over Lockstock and Barrow. We took over the... when they say Lockstock and Barrow we took</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:40.480"> over the stock and uh and rented the farm there. Okay. Yes. Mm hmm. Langorse and um</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:46.640"> I liked Langorse very much.

I&#039;m getting confused.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:07.360"> So Winford is Dillwyn&#039;s father?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:09.060"> That&#039;s right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:09.480"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:09.720"> So Winford was on the drainage board.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:12.040"> So what do...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:12.540"> What can you tell me about Dillwyn&#039;s parents?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:14.680"> And on the farm and...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:16.760"> Er, well, erm, Dillwyn&#039;s...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:19.100"> Dillwyn&#039;s dad, erm, Winford,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:21.800"> er, has got a brother,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:23.560"> I&#039;m sure he photographs out there afterwards,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:25.660"> erm, Campbell Cross.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:27.040"> So he was a barrister-in-law</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:28.040"> and he was out in abroad for a long time, Singapore.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:31.760"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:32.460"> And then he had a sister,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:33.940"> erm, which I&#039;ve got the photo...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:36.080"> The whole family&#039;s over there, you can see later in.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:38.740"> And, erm, then he had a sister that lived in,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:42.380"> erm, in...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:44.380"> Cardiff Road.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:45.860"> Er, and then, erm, is Missy Campbell.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:50.920"> And then there was Dillwyn who was killed in the war,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:53.820"> First World War.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:55.600"> And, erm, that was Winford.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:59.200"> Erm, well, I&#039;ll have to...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:00.560"> I can show you the photograph.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:02.000"> I won&#039;t...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:02.300"> It&#039;s on the wall, so it&#039;s easy for you to...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:03.920"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:04.320"> You know, to have a look at it on the wall, really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:05.680"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:05.940"> So that was, like, that was Dillwyn&#039;s father&#039;s side,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:08.720"> you see, of the...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:09.540"> And do you know...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:10.220"> And they had butcher&#039;s shops in Cardiff,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:13.040"> Clifton Street.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:13.900"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:14.380"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:14.520"> There&#039;s a big butcher in there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:16.280"> And, erm, that was their business, more or less, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:19.100"> So, a...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:20.240"> A butchery shop.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:21.640"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:22.040"> Butcher&#039;s shop.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:22.700"> So, when did the farm come into the...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:26.180"> Well, Winford, erm, he wasn&#039;t keen on the butchery shop,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:29.580"> so he went farming then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:31.080"> So he took over...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:32.240"> Took sluice then, rented sluice.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:34.860"> Oh, right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:35.500"> And then, of course, the milk.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:36.640"> And then there was to have a milk round,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:38.780"> er, with a milk van and everything.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:40.360"> And, erm, Dillwyn used to go occasionally when his father</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:43.240"> had a meeting up in London,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:45.160"> but, er, he wasn&#039;t so keen on the...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:47.280"> on the milk round.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:49.620"> But, er, he used to do it when his father had to go to London</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:52.740"> for meetings with the drainage board and that, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:55.360"> So why did they have meetings in London?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:58.160"> I... I don&#039;t know, really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:01.240"> But, erm...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:02.040"> And, of course, they used to have the meetings out at, erm,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:04.720"> Magar, didn&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:05.780"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:06.540"> That&#039;s the place... Is it Magar?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:08.300"> Yes, Magar, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:09.620"> They used to have the...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:10.380"> Oh, Nash.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:11.560"> Nash, rather. That&#039;s right, Nash.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:13.140"> Oh, Pye.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:13.240"> Pye Corner.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:13.680"> That&#039;s right, Pye Corner.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:14.760"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:15.380"> Nash, Nash, yes, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:17.300"> Yeah, so, er...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:18.500"> So was it... was it always a dairy farm then,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:21.560"> the Stute farm?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:23.160"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:24.640"> They had cow... we had cows and everything,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:26.280"> and sheep.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:27.480"> But, erm...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:28.540"> And then we moved up here later,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:30.840"> and then, erm, they moved there,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:32.840"> but then they went out to the cows.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:34.500"> And so the Andrews only got the sheep at the moment.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:37.340"> So then you met, erm, Dillwyn.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:39.980"> Through Young Farmers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:41.240"> Through Young Farmers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:42.180"> And so, erm, er, what...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:44.080"> So where did you marry, actually?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:46.480"> In Coedcoonoo Church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:48.100"> Oh, did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:48.760"> It&#039;s a dear little church, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:49.700"> It&#039;s a house now, it&#039;s been turned into...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:51.520"> Yes, Coedcoonoo...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:52.500"> Do you know, erm...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:53.580"> Do you know, erm...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:55.300"> Well, you know the main road I said about with this article,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:57.960"> so you turn down for Coedcoonoo...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:59.520"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:59.780"> ...for the golf course.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:00.560"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:00.900"> And it&#039;s just before you get to the golf course.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:03.600"> Or just after the golf course, sorry.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:05.360"> On the right?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:05.880"> On the left-hand side,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:06.940"> you&#039;ve got a little lane up to the church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:09.260"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:09.920"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:10.020"> Oh, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve been to the church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:12.220"> Oh, I don&#039;t either.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:12.720"> It&#039;s a house now, people, it&#039;s, erm...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:14.640"> Was it a chapel then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:15.680"> Or was it a chapel?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:16.280"> No, a church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:17.120"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:17.880"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:18.500"> Yeah, Coedcoonoo Church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:19.200"> Oh, I have to go back that way afterwards.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:21.120"> I might go and have a look.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:22.280"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:23.140"> I had no idea.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:24.240"> And, erm, I think there&#039;s three or four houses there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:27.320"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:27.880"> Er, because there was a farm next to it,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:29.580"> but they&#039;ve gone into, into homesteads, you see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:32.260"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:32.620"> So then, so did you then start your married life at Seuss Farm?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:36.660"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:37.220"> You moved in with...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:38.260"> I moved...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:38.420"> ...with your in-laws?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:40.020"> No, no, they moved, they built a house.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:41.640"> Do you see the house on the side there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:43.260"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:43.460"> They built that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:44.480"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:44.840"> And then we went into the farmhouse,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:46.980"> and they built, they built that and went into there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:49.620"> So this would have been, what, the mid-50s?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:52.540"> Yes, 57.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:54.280"> 57?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:55.040"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:55.640"> So, erm, so what was the farm doing then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:58.420"> Was it...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:59.060"> Er, milk.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:00.060"> Milk.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:00.500"> Milk, and milk round.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:01.700"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:02.220"> Yeah, and just fill the bottles, you know,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:03.720"> and wash the bottles then in a, in a little shed that was there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:07.200"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:07.840"> It&#039;s, erm, yes, it&#039;s, I think...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:10.020"> I&#039;ve got a photograph here.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:11.920"> Excuse me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:13.880"> How many cows did you have, Margaret?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:16.680"> Pardon?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:17.020"> How many cows did you have?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:19.080"> Er, well, not like they&#039;ve got today.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:20.920"> They&#039;ve got hundreds today, haven&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:22.180"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:22.480"> And they&#039;ve really been 125.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:24.300"> That&#039;s dope.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:24.900"> Which is quite, you know, big for those days, I suppose, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:27.920"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:28.020"> You know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:28.660"> And I&#039;ve got a photograph here, I think, haven&#039;t I?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:31.080"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:32.800"> And that wasn&#039;t all hand-milt, was it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:36.100"> Pardon?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:36.620"> Was that all milked by hand?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:38.440"> Well, it was years ago,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:39.400"> and then they, of course, they went in with the machines then, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:45.080"> This is a photograph of Slough&#039;s house.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:47.900"> This was before 1963.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:52.500"> That&#039;s where it was when I used to live there, see?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:54.560"> Oh, crikey.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:55.260"> There was a milk van by there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:56.860"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:57.320"> A dairy there where they used to, er, russet milk bottles.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:00.520"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:00.940"> Cows used to go into there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:02.280"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:02.680"> And then this was the garden.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:04.040"> I mean, Anne&#039;s got a beautiful garden down there now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:06.260"> Wow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:06.700"> And then there was just a shed where we kept chickens.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:08.960"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:09.400"> And then there was a little shed there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:10.540"> So it all altered, of course, because all of this is buildings here now, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:14.020"> This has all changed, hasn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:15.460"> Yeah, all definitely.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:16.020"> I mean, it&#039;s all built up.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:17.060"> It was very rural then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:18.160"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:18.700"> Yes, yes, it was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:19.940"> Crikey.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:20.800"> And then in this field here, which Father Prosserow was in-wound, that&#039;s where they</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:25.640"> built the house you can see Wyvern.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:27.620"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:28.100"> You know, they built that there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:29.800"> Did they build that because Dilwyn was getting married?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:33.520"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:34.020"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:34.520"> They built that to go in there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:36.140"> And, erm, oh, I&#039;m sorry.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:38.560"> I was only thinking about the house.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:39.380"> I was thinking about how much it cost the other day.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:40.900"> I think it was about 90...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:43.520"> Oh, I&#039;ve forgotten the money.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:45.180"> I&#039;m not sure I was thinking about how much it cost the other day.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:48.320"> The bridge cost nearly more to get across the ream to get to the house than the house,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:53.180"> I think.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:53.640"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:54.260"> Yes, it was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:55.060"> You forget about that, don&#039;t you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:56.660"> Yes, you do.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:56.840"> You have to get across the ream.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:58.040"> That&#039;s true.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:58.660"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:00.080"> So what were your first impressions when you moved down there and started married</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:03.540"> life?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:04.880"> Well, I used to go back and forth there before we were actually married, you know,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:08.420"> and have sex, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:09.360"> And, erm, I didn&#039;t have any friends there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:09.900"> And, erm, I had a couple of things with my mother-in-law and, erm, yes, well, I liked</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:15.040"> it very much because we had ground with Berry Hill.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:18.700"> We had two fields on the moors, as we call them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:21.440"> Okay.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:21.860"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:22.320"> I rented those.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:24.300"> And, erm, so it wasn&#039;t any different for me, really, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:28.820"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:29.240"> And then, of course, you used to go to Young Farmers there and we used to go to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:32.140"> Young Farmers Club in St. Melons.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:33.760"> Did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:34.360"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:35.120"> And the chapel there used to hold the Young Farmers meetings.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:38.060"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:38.440"> But, erm, I didn&#039;t get that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:39.360"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:40.140"> I enjoyed life.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:41.440"> So, as a farmer&#039;s wife, so I&#039;ve spoken to lots of farmers, and, erm, so as a farmer&#039;s</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:46.880"> wife, would you, would you have been aware of and concerned with all the reams and the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:53.200"> maintenance and stuff?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:54.560"> I mean, I guess what I&#039;m trying to ask is, was there very much a clear, this was what</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:59.280"> the woman did and this is what the men did, or was it all mixed up?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:03.500"> Erm, well, I think, I, I used to, I used to enjoy going out and feeding calves and</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:08.340"> things and that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:09.080"> You know?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:09.800"> And then when he was born, he used to be, we used to put him in the pram and put him</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:13.140"> in the corner of the milk and shed.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:15.120"> And he&#039;d be sat there, you know, watching the cows coming in and out and all that sort</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:18.500"> of thing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:19.060"> And, er, before we had a parlour, that was the milking parlour type of thing, you know,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:24.320"> where you could get up and in and all that sort of thing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:26.440"> But, erm, yeah, I&#039;ve always been, I&#039;ve always been interested outside.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:31.020"> Because I used to spend quite a bit of time before we went to Langhorst with my, my grandparents</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:35.840"> at, erm, Newhouse Farm Panty.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:38.860"> And I used to go out there and stay when I was a little tot, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:42.820"> Put me on the bus in Newport and my aunt would meet me in New Inn.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:46.700"> How lovely!</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:47.940"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:48.420"> So, did you ever get involved in the bottling of milk down there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:51.980"> I used to have sometimes, and that helped, erm, wash, my father probably used to, you</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:56.440"> know, mostly he&#039;d do that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:58.340"> I&#039;d have to come back off the round and then wash the bottles and get them ready then to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:02.960"> fill up the next morning.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:04.820"> You know, it&#039;s, er, yeah, oh yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:07.660"> Oh yes, I&#039;ve had a, I&#039;ve had a, I&#039;ve had a, I&#039;ve had a, I&#039;ve had a, I&#039;ve had a, I&#039;ve had</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:08.840"> a, I&#039;ve had a, I&#039;ve had a very enjoyable life really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:11.480"> That&#039;s, er, you can tell that, it shows in your face.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:13.980"> Oh, does it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:14.220"> It&#039;s lovely.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:14.660"> Yeah, it does!</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:15.840"> What about the poultry, was that the important part of the, the fun?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:19.080"> Yeah, we used to sell eggs on the, on the milk farm quite a lot, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:23.380"> And then, if there was any surplus eggs then, er, I used to bring them to the Husband Brothers,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:28.520"> we used to have, erm, er, er, well, I don&#039;t know, what do, what do you call it, an egg,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:34.360"> erm, centre that they would have eggs and then they&#039;d take them out on delivery.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:38.820"> It was a very, very different, very different, very different, very different, very different</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:39.440"> Where were the Husband Brothers based?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:41.080"> Er, it&#039;s in, er, it&#039;s, it&#039;s, erm, Lisvane.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:44.240"> Oh really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:45.040"> Yes, yes, but that&#039;s all different now altogether.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:48.080"> Mmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:48.360"> You know, it&#039;s, places change, don&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:50.400"> Yeah!</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:51.040"> Well it&#039;s interesting looking at this photograph, because you must have seen enormous change</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:55.780"> in your lifetime down there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:57.560"> Oh yes, yeah, especially now, er, more buildings up for stock and everything, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:02.500"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:03.060"> And, er, I mean, I, I was trying to keep it, well, clean side, you know, all this business.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:07.520"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:07.740"> And we used to have a boy living in then, you see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:09.880"> Did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:10.420"> Yes, yes, you know the, er, excuse me, you know the kitchen?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:15.080"> Mmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:15.500"> You, you go in through the back door, don&#039;t you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:17.420"> That&#039;s the dinar-, kitchen for every day.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:20.220"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:20.480"> Then there&#039;s the kitchen, isn&#039;t there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:21.840"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:22.080"> Then there&#039;s the other room.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:23.320"> Mmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:23.660"> Well, we used to have a boy living in there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:25.500"> Did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:26.060"> Yes, yeah, and, erm, he had his bed in there and there was a stove in the corner.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:30.760"> We used to have for the fire and he had an armchair.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:33.300"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:33.600"> He always ate with us.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:34.860"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:35.580"> And, erm, yes, so, er, we used to have a, er, we used to have a, er, we used to have</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:37.720"> a stove in there and there was a stove.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:37.960"> So, we always had a boy living in.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:39.220"> And who, who was he?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:40.900"> Was it a series of people or?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:42.980"> Erm, well, yes, different wa-, er, we, we had a few from St Bride that didn&#039;t live</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:47.620"> in there, came back and forth, which is the, you know, from Cuck-, or Cuckoo New, but,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:51.640"> erm, a couple of st-, er, actually lived in there, you know, with us and they&#039;d eat with</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:56.440"> us and all this business, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:58.120"> That, erm, I mean, you had a tele-, er, well, not a television, a wireless more like, but</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:02.500"> he did have a television towards the end.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:05.320"> And, erm, yes, we always had a boy living in there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:07.700"> I suppose the farm could support that,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:11.600"> whereas it would be difficult to do that today, wouldn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:13.980"> Well, I suppose, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:15.260"> It&#039;s the different ideas today, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:17.780"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:19.520"> Different world today, really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:21.300"> It&#039;s changed a lot, really, with farming, hasn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:24.060"> Did you have sheep, then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:26.040"> Yes, we had some sheep, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:27.880"> Pet lambs and something, you know, feed those.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:31.380"> Yes, I can&#039;t remember how many sheep.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:34.500"> We didn&#039;t have so many sheep as we know, naturally,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:36.180"> because we had the dairy in as well, you see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:40.660"> Yes, oh yes, I&#039;ve enjoyed my life up until now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:47.120"> So Ant used to go up onto the seawall and bring the sheep in on ponies.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:51.580"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:52.100"> Did you ever get involved with that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:53.840"> No, not really, no, no.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:55.920"> Yes, we put sheep over on the seawall,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:58.260"> and then Doreen, Derek&#039;s father, Philip, would come over</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:05.500"> and...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:06.180"> and they&#039;d have this horse and a little trap thing, you know,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:08.860"> and they&#039;d sit in there, and they&#039;d go up then to get onto the bus</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:12.380"> and to bring the sheep up and all this business, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:14.740"> And then one day, I don&#039;t know what happened, but anyhow,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:17.760"> the pony started kicking the bottom of the bus in,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:21.480"> and of course got out of the shafts and left these four or five of us,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:26.320"> and the bus went backwards rather than south.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:30.360"> What, backwards down the slope?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:31.980"> Well, it went back, but it went back, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:33.940"> I see, because the horse had gone.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:35.340"> There were shafts.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:36.180"> There were shafts hanging over the wall.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:37.760"> Were they okay?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:38.940"> Well, they were all right, and the dog jumped out a bit quick,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:41.860"> and the dog was in there as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:44.080"> Oh dear, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:45.280"> They used to come over every Sunday and go down and see the sheep and all sorts of those,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:50.420"> and bring them up for us.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:51.840"> Because the sheep used to graze on the other side of...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:54.360"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:55.500"> Mm-hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:56.080"> So...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:56.480"> And then to, like, the tide used to come in so far, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:00.680"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:01.080"> But they hired the, I think they hired the bank then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:07.260"> Yes, they did hire it because, of course, the sea, the water was coming,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:11.100"> the sea was getting higher, wasn&#039;t it, you know?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:14.040"> Because you&#039;re very close to the seawall there, aren&#039;t you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:16.720"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:17.040"> It&#039;s on the field, really, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:18.580"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:18.940"> The field across.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:19.420"> Did you ever experience the water coming over?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:22.360"> You see it sometimes if it was very rough, just splashing up a bit, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:26.940"> But, you know, I never had the thought in mind of thinking,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:31.760"> oh gosh, I hope it doesn&#039;t come over there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:34.400"> Never thought of that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:35.620"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:36.180"> I suppose it does, it has, well, it has in some places over the years,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:39.860"> isn&#039;t it, you see?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:40.640"> Did you ever use the shore where the sheet grays?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:43.620"> Is there like a picnic spot when you had children when you were little?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:46.180"> Yeah, we used to go over there and, like, a lot of the...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:51.460"> Have you been over there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:52.200"> You&#039;ve been over there, of course.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:53.400"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:54.320"> But I haven&#039;t been over there for years, really, so I don&#039;t know what it&#039;s like.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:57.440"> But we used to have little, little, what&#039;s the name of the water coming in</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:02.280"> where there&#039;s been bits and ditches?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:04.160"> Yeah, like rivulets.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:05.220"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:06.280"> Mm-hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:07.000"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:07.440"> Yeah, we used to go over there with our neighbours, Eddins, his next farm,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:11.160"> Slough&#039;s Farm, that would be, the one just on the side of the road.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:15.220"> And, yeah, we&#039;d go over there for picnics and, yeah, we&#039;d just have a, you know,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:20.040"> now and again have a good time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:21.800"> Was it, was it, was there a real sense of community there then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:30.960"> Down the village, yeah, you mean the village itself?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:34.460"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:34.880"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:35.480"> Yes, because those, those opposite the hall, those are all built, Susie, because when I went down there first,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:42.320"> there was no houses there then, you know, so they&#039;d been built.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:44.940"> And at the back of the hall is a little cul-de-sac.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:48.740"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:49.260"> That&#039;s the council houses further over.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:51.820"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:52.180"> They were, they were there when I went down.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:53.920"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:54.600"> And different houses being built around there, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:57.980"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:58.540"> Oh, it&#039;s nice, I mean, I&#039;m quite upset, really, because WI have been a member for 62 years down there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:05.300"> Have you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:06.140"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:06.880"> And I used to take my mother-in-law because she didn&#039;t drive, Deryn&#039;s mother didn&#039;t drive.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:11.280"> So when then, after lunch, we&#039;d go down on the second Tuesday, the month, I used to pick her up and we&#039;d go down,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:18.640"> because she was president at that time, and there was the, the old black stowage, I don&#039;t know whether you&#039;ve seen the old round black stowage.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:25.940"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:26.160"> It was like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:27.200"> In the village hall?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:28.280"> In the village hall.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:29.200"> And then put the chairs and tables up, and then go back then, and I&#039;d pick her up then for, after tea then, to go to the house.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:35.280"> So we&#039;d go to WI. And, yes, we did that for years.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:39.440"> And then I used to have the milk van then. I had the milk van for a couple of, oh, for about a week or more in the afternoons,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:45.900"> to go to a place in Bremondy to get a sanding machine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:50.680"> And then, put in the back there, and then we&#039;d do the floor, you know, sand, get the floor all nice and, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:57.080"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:57.580"> Yes. Oh, we&#039;ve had some good times round there. Really good times.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:00.220"> So somebody was telling me that St. Bride WI used to have a canning machine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:05.720"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:06.340"> Do you know about that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:07.300"> Yes. Yes. And Mother Prosser had it. Now, where it is, I don&#039;t know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:11.460"> Yes, because we used to put fruit into our own canning.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:14.560"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:15.240"> Hmm. Hmm. I wonder where it is. Now, I, I, I&#039;d forgotten about that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:22.140"> I wonder where that is now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:25.940"> Yes, now I wonder where it, where that is.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:29.520"> You&#039;ve got me thinking now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:31.860"> I&#039;d be trying to explore where it is.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:33.680"> So would they, would they, would they...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:35.280"> Would the WI rent it out, or would they take it out to people and say, do the canning for people?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:41.280"> Er, I could, I wouldn&#039;t, I can&#039;t say that. I mean, erm, I know we used to borrow it and do our own.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:48.000"> At least Mother Prosser did more than I did, but I&#039;d give a hand, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:52.120"> But, erm, that&#039;s interesting how you brought up that canning machine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:55.700"> I was going to bother you now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:56.580"> I&#039;d be worried about that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:58.340"> It&#039;d be lovely if it&#039;s still around somewhere.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:00.440"> Yes. Yes, it would, wouldn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:03.740"> And it&#039;s still going, the St Bride&#039;s WI?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:06.580"> St Bride&#039;s? No, no, it&#039;s, it&#039;s folded up a long time ago.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:09.660"> Oh, really? Oh, that&#039;s a shame.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:11.260"> Yes, yes, yes. So a lot of the people from there now come to Peterstone.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:15.480"> And this is why I&#039;m, I&#039;m rather upset that Peterstone is talking about folding up.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:19.760"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:20.640"> Mm, mm. I mean, the secretary, she&#039;s moving away down to Swansea. Well, that&#039;s fair enough.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:25.700"> Er, the president, she did say, erm, that, er, she&#039;d do it for another two years.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:31.140"> Well, the two years has come up now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:32.500"> And no one else wants to take the responsibility.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:35.680"> That&#039;s such a shame.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:36.720"> It is a shame. It is a shame.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:38.340"> And it&#039;s been going how long?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:39.680"> Well, I&#039;ve, I&#039;ve been down there 62 years.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:42.500"> That&#039;s phenomenal, Margaret.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:44.200"> Mm, mm. And it was on a long time before that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:46.700"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:47.360"> Yeah, so sad, really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:48.720"> How many members have you got down there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:50.700"> Yeah, we, we, we, there&#039;s, there&#039;s, erm, from St Bride&#039;s area, around Asda, where people live,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:58.400"> er, I expect there&#039;s 14 people come from that area.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:03.040"> And it, it seems such a shame that, erm, you know, no one will take it on.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:07.780"> After all that time?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:09.080"> Yeah, it is.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:09.920"> Because I was president for some, about seven years, er, after Mother Pross has given it up, I don&#039;t know how long she was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:16.700"> But, erm, no, it&#039;s quite sad. I was quite, quite, erm, upset about it, really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:21.700"> But I&#039;m hoping, erm, that I, I might join Kevin Mabley, Michael Stoneman.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:27.800"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:28.140"> Which is nearer.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:29.160"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:29.720"> But, erm, the distance in Michigan.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:32.480"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:32.600"> I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll make any difference to me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:33.300"> I was talking about the long...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:34.300"> Yeah, the longevity, though, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:35.240"> Winds, winds and weather.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:36.020"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:36.380"> Pick up a couple of ladies from our school on the way down, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:39.280"> Oh, how sweet.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:39.880"> Yeah, she used to enjoy it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:41.620"> That&#039;s how it goes, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:43.600"> So the, erm, er, so you, you said Mother Pross used to can fruit.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:49.800"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:50.240"> Where did, where did her fruit come from?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:52.220"> Oh, well, erm, she had, we had plum, plum trees.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:55.440"> You know, we had trees, we had plum trees in the, erm, we had a couple of trees around here.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:00.620"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:00.900"> Plum trees and things and then, well, I suppose that was our garden then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:05.040"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:05.580"> You know, and then we&#039;d have beans and stuff like that and, you know, to roast it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:10.160"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:10.500"> But, erm, yeah, I&#039;ve, I&#039;ve forgotten about that canning machine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:14.480"> So what was the process then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:16.160"> So you&#039;d pick the fruit and then wash it, presumably?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:18.780"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:19.100"> And then put it, make a syrup.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:21.000"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:21.500"> And then put it in the tins.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:23.520"> And then with the machine you&#039;d seal it all and that would be a tin fruit.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:28.600"> Gosh, and that would last all the winter?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:30.480"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:30.900"> Well, yes, if, you know, you make, you make as much as you can, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:34.140"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:34.300"> Or we could.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:35.800"> And, erm, yes, gosh, I&#039;m glad you thought, thought about the canning machine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:40.260"> You&#039;ve got me worried now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:41.380"> Well, it&#039;s come up a few times, you see, so I thought, how curious.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:44.740"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:45.120"> I&#039;d never heard of a canning machine before.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:46.900"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:47.360"> And that St. Bride&#039;s WI has a canning machine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:50.520"> It just sounds really resourceful to me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:53.200"> Yes, that&#039;s right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:54.760"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:56.420"> I wonder where that is now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:59.160"> Did the, did the, did the WI, because in the past the WI has been absolutely fantastic</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:04.220"> at recording local people and their memories.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:07.940"> Did the St. Bride&#039;s WI ever do anything like that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:11.700"> Ah, no, they folded up, as I say, and then a couple of them came from there then, which</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:16.260"> are a few more now, because the president it is now, er, she lives in one of the houses</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:21.300"> by our stairs.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:22.300"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:22.500"> And, of course, a couple of her friends have come as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:24.820"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:25.300"> But, erm, as I say, I, I was quite upset about that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:27.980"> I was quite upset last week when I knew that it was going to fold up.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:29.800"> Oh, that is upsetting.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:30.720"> Yes, it is, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:31.980"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:32.240"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:32.780"> But there we are.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:33.700"> If people are not interested, you can&#039;t, erm, can&#039;t force people to be.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:38.160"> You can&#039;t, unfortunately.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:39.120"> You can try and encourage.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:40.240"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:40.700"> But, erm, yeah, so.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:42.760"> So, as a young woman, a young wife, was it part, part of your, one&#039;s social life, the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:48.400"> WI?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:49.060"> It was, really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:50.140"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:50.760"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:51.660"> I went up to London.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:53.240"> For the two AGMs.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:54.880"> Excuse me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:55.400"> Just.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:56.680"> WI was something that you did as a young wife and it&#039;s something you&#039;ve continued to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:02.500"> do for a long time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:03.600"> Yes, yes, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:05.040"> I, erm, yes, I enjoyed WI.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:07.580"> I went to London to the AGM on two occasions, which is at the, er, Albert Hall.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:13.520"> And that was very interesting where they come from all over the country there and, you know,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:18.040"> that&#039;s, that&#039;s gone back a bit.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:20.380"> But, you know, being, it, so what struck me about, you know, down on the moors there,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:24.980"> that it&#039;s quite.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:25.600"> It&#039;s quite a different landscape, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:27.320"> It&#039;s flat.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:28.080"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:28.540"> I think all the watercourses.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:29.560"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:30.000"> Was that a challenge in some way?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:32.740"> I don&#039;t know whether you&#039;ve found, erm, of course, there&#039;s people living in the church</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:36.680"> now, the church was, er, was, and on about, oh, what, what am I, five foot, am I five</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:42.820"> foot or nothing?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:43.580"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:44.140"> Er, it&#039;s up about, erm, fuck, well, I should know that, was it, where the Great Flood was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:49.640"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:50.800"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:51.060"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:51.400"> And, erm, the bank, you can see the bank.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:54.360"> Now we&#039;re one of the fields.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:55.240"> We&#039;re one of the farms up, as you go down the road a bit.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:58.580"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:59.080"> It&#039;s, erm, yes, er, well, I think I&#039;m right in saying that the water more or less came</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:05.240"> up near the lip of Castleton.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:06.360"> Yeah, it was, yeah, because it goes down, doesn&#039;t it, apparently.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:09.280"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:09.580"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:10.000"> It&#039;s very low, very low.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:11.400"> Did you ever experience flooding there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:13.760"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:14.640"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:15.140"> The rains would fill up, quite a way, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:17.600"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:17.720"> But no, no, we never had any flooding, as such, no.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:20.800"> What was it like having young children around those things, though?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:24.140"> Was it ever a worry?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:25.800"> Erm, oh, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:27.420"> Now, the neighbours further down, the next farm down to, erm, was a farm then, er, they</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:32.740"> lost a child that drowned in the, in the, erm, water.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:36.720"> Oh, really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:37.340"> And also, instant brides.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:39.420"> The child drowned instant brides in the rain.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:42.220"> Oh, really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:42.780"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:43.940"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:44.640"> But, erm, I suppose you get, er, I suppose if you&#039;re, if you&#039;re born down there, you</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:49.320"> get used to it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:50.380"> I know the one that&#039;s came down, the one down, er, further on down the road, it&#039;s,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:54.120"> from London, came down to see the sister, erm, came down and brought the little one,</div><div

Rhine?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:23.980"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:24.100"> On the Rhine?</div><div class="transcript_line"

er, at Crowder River, River of Langos,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:51.220"> we used to take one of these little boats.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:53.300"> Er.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:53.660"> And we used to go down to the other side of Langos, Langasti.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:57.880"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:58.400"> And I don&#039;t know where, even with Langos.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:00.280"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:00.700"> And if you look across there, there&#039;s a little hall.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:03.220"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:03.560"> About three fields from the end of the river, I said.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:06.280"> And, er, Langasti Hall.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:07.880"> And we used to go across there to dances.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:10.220"> And we&#039;d take one of these skiff boats, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:13.720"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:13.900"> And we used to row across there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:15.580"> Did you really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:16.500"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:16.540"> And, erm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:17.260"> It was quite some distance.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:18.700"> Yes, it was really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:19.920"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:20.040"> But when you, you don&#039;t notice distance, do you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:22.000"> I wouldn&#039;t do it now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:23.660"> I wouldn&#039;t do it now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:23.940"> And we used to tether it there and walk up these two fields, go to the dance, come back</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:28.560"> then and row back.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:29.940"> My goodness.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:31.120"> Imagine if my daughter was doing that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:32.940"> I&#039;d be, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:33.880"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:34.240"> That&#039;s good.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:34.520"> Our parents don&#039;t know what we&#039;re doing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:35.980"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:36.320"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:36.760"> That&#039;s what we used to do then years ago when we were young.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:39.060"> Do you remember the, erm, did you ever help with hay making as a young farmer&#039;s wife?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:46.240"> Er.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:46.780"> Well, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:47.400"> Dry the tractor, perhaps, and that, you know, the baling.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:49.860"> Oh, OK.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:50.200"> And, of course, we had, erm, I don&#039;t know, a four-horse.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:53.640"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:54.720"> I might have got a photograph here where, erm, just kind of, excuse me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:59.560"> And what&#039;s this prize here then, Margaret?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:02.000"> Well, this is when I was, I was first lady chairman of, erm, of St. Melon&#039;s Show.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:07.700"> Now you, that was a big show someone said to me.</div><div

Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:13.000"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:13.280"> Fair play it was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:14.260"> And I still look forward to St. Melon&#039;s Show.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:17.640"> So is it a very strong farming community?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:20.580"> Is it a very close-knit farming community?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:23.260"> Farming.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:23.620"> Farming.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:24.100"> Yes, I think, yeah, I think so.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:25.500"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:26.420"> You know, we do a lot of things together.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:28.240"> We had two donkeys.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:30.080"> And, erm, I had this donkey down at Slough&#039;s.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:33.940"> And then we put her in foal.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:36.180"> And, oh, you&#039;ve never seen such a sweet thing when there&#039;s little one came.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:40.580"> I think the whole village came down to see it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:42.600"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:43.160"> Oh, just the, the deal thing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:44.800"> Someone told me that farmers kept donkeys because they were good luck.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:48.740"> Well, yes, they, they, they, they, erm, they do, a lot of people have had a donkey.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:53.560"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line"

Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:55.540"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:55.960"> Well, I&#039;ve never heard that before.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:57.240"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:57.960"> I don&#039;t know whether it&#039;s, or there&#039;s, there, spent it, there&#039;s a little one, single.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:03.240"> Wow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:03.480"> This is 1955.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:05.060"> I sold my sheep and I bought the little sports car.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:09.040"> Is that you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:10.060"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:10.360"> No, that&#039;s not me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:11.420"> My, that&#039;s my mother and my aunt.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:12.880"> But that&#039;s the little car I bought.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:14.500"> You bought it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:15.380"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:15.580"> I sold the sheep and I bought the little car.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:17.780"> Oh, I think that&#039;s so impressive.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:19.800"> That must have Parkinson&#039;s been very unusual for you young woman then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:23.000"> Yeah, oh yeah, we used to have some fun. We used to go following the hounds.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:27.080"> Did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:27.820"> Yeah, on the top there. And then one day, walking back to the car, here comes the local policeman with a steering wheel in his hand. He took the steering wheel off.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:39.700"> Why?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:40.240"> I went to Blackpool in that, and back.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:42.900"> Oh my goodness, me? What sort of car is it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:46.060"> It was a built-up Le Mans Singer. It had a Singer engine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:51.480"> I am so impressed with you. Oh my goodness. And so you followed the hounds down on the moors?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:58.420"> Yes, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:59.260"> Really? Derek was telling me about that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:01.080"> Yes, yes, the Shudiga hunt.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:03.080"> Oh, so where would you go?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:04.940"> And the Shudiga hunt was based in Bayslake, but it&#039;s all been built on now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:12.120"> Yeah?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:12.620"> So they&#039;ve gone up to Gellie Gare, the hounds up there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:16.480"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:16.860"> So, I mean, we use them if we have dead stock or something.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:21.480"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:21.720"> We pay so much a year for them to pick up, to take it up to the year, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:25.840"> But then you would follow them in your car, would you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:28.260"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:28.700"> And who would you do that with?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:29.920"> And I sang Top of Pen-a-Lan. I don&#039;t know, Top of Pen-a-Lan.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:32.640"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:33.100"> Up there, we&#039;d be up there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:34.380"> That&#039;s like an orchard there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:36.480"> Yes, yeah, we used to have trees.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:39.020"> So did you get apples off those as well?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:41.560"> Yes, apples and pears.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:42.960"> Did you ever make cider from them?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:45.300"> No, no, but we used to can them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:47.260"> Can them?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:47.800"> Mm-hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:48.640"> Gosh, that&#039;s lovely.

data-time="00:38:21.480"> Would you have had to make all the lunches for everyone coming in?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:24.700"> Who was helping with the haymaking?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:25.580"> Yeah, usually in the evening I&#039;d cook ham, potatoes and stuff like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:29.880"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:30.420"> They&#039;d come in at supper time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:31.780"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:32.200"> Not so much in the daytime.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:33.720"> I mean, they&#039;d have something to eat, sandwiches or something.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:36.100"> But I used to cook them in the evening, you know, for them to come in.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:39.420"> Yeah, and they&#039;d come back.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:40.460"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:40.880"> Yeah, we had a lovely life, really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:44.000"> And that was me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:45.220"> So did you ever...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:46.260"> You were probably then too young to have ever thatched hay ricks then and stuff.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:52.340"> Well, yeah, I&#039;ve seen them done.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:54.460"> Have you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:55.120"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:55.800"> When I was at my grandparents&#039;, they used to do it there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:59.920"> But of course, we&#039;ve always had the bands and of course the bales now, but we used to do small bales.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:04.980"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:05.780"> I think there&#039;s a certain amount of small bales now, if I remember rightly.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:10.600"> Because it&#039;s the round ones now, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:12.680"> Yes, of course.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:13.540"> You know, the big round ones.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:16.120"> Yeah, so times have altered.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:17.980"> So was there any...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:18.980"> There&#039;s something I&#039;ve been meaning to ask and I&#039;ve forgotten to ask.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:21.480"> I&#039;ll ask everybody else.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:22.200"> But was there, excuse me, any food or meals?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:29.860"> So, for example, my parents are Irish and a traditional meal we would have would be boiled ham, Parsi sauce and something called chump, which was potatoes and onions and cabbage.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:44.260"> Yes, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:44.840"> Is there anything on the moors that was traditional like that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:47.820"> Any particular dishes or...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:49.560"> I used to always boil ham.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:50.940"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:51.480"> You know, I like boiled ham.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:53.380"> It&#039;s nice and potatoes and stuff like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:56.540"> No, I suppose...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:58.500"> I think it&#039;s a thing that&#039;s a farmhouse meal, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:05.520"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:05.720"> Boiled ham, potatoes, peas, Parsi sauce.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:10.040"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:10.560"> You know, that type of thing, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:12.360"> So you would always be in the kitchen providing food for people working on the farm?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:16.880"> Yes, yes, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:18.320"> Oh, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:19.320"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:20.320"> And...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:20.760"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:21.480"> And...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:21.920"> Yes, I used to go out and feed the chicken in there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:25.180"> I used to feed the poultry, you know, feed the poultry and all that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:28.960"> But, yes, and they&#039;d come in then about two, I was 10, 11 o&#039;clock and then they&#039;d sit down</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:34.200"> and have supper and then they&#039;d go about 12 o&#039;clock, 1 o&#039;clock.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:37.500"> Wow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:38.480"> Wow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:38.960"> Yes, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:39.760"> I always enjoyed the hay making.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:41.260"> You know, the harvest time used to be lovely.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:43.380"> Great.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:43.640"> Well, why was...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:44.260"> What was it...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:44.760"> Why did you like it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:45.920"> Because it was just a...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:46.580"> Well, I think...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:48.020"> Well, meeting...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:48.860"> They used to come in and I was in...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:51.240"> And then, you know, we&#039;d go hauling the bales and all this business, you know, the loose</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:56.020"> hay years ago.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:56.960"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:57.260"> I thought I had a photograph here of...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:00.260"> I haven&#039;t got one.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:01.580"> I thought I had a photograph here of the...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:05.060"> Oh, what was it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:05.840"> So, do you remember any of the people who used to work for the drainage board that used</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:10.120"> to come round and clear the reams and stuff?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:15.740"> Oh, dear, what was his name?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:18.820"> I can see him now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:20.340"> Oh, really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:22.120"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:24.240"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:24.700"> Oh, they look into me in a moment.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:27.340"> Yes, he was just slashed, you know, with a long-handled hook.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:30.820"> Oh, do you remember that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:31.840"> Down the broadway.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:32.300"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:32.920"> Down the broadway, particularly.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:34.200"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:35.000"> Um...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:35.960"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:38.000"> Well, the one that&#039;s died now back a couple of months ago...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:44.960"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:45.720"> Um...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:47.160"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:49.280"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:50.240"> I can&#039;t think of the name.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:51.220"> I can&#039;t think of the other gentleman.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:52.000"> I can see him now doing this, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:55.780"> Well, he&#039;s silly, isn&#039;t he?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:57.300"> He&#039;ll come to you.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:58.460"> He&#039;ll come.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:59.780"> And so, Dilwyn was on the drainage board.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:02.400"> Yeah, Dilwyn was on the drainage board, and his father was before him.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:05.420"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:05.740"> So, what did that mean?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:07.260"> Does it mean just, you know, was it an important role?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:12.660"> Well, I suppose it controlled the reams and everything, really, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:16.240"> The drainage board, more or less.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:17.780"> You know, it was to see that they were cut in the reed.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:21.220"> The reeds were cut and everything from off the sides.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:24.780"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:25.220"> And I suppose controlled the gates.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:29.120"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:29.560"> It opened out opposite the bottom of the broadway.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:33.060"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:33.500"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:33.940"> The gates are automatic.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:35.260"> It&#039;s all automatic now, you see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:36.820"> Yeah, it&#039;s all changed.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:37.160"> Years ago, it used to have to be done more or less by hand.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:40.160"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:40.500"> You know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:42.000"> So, it&#039;s...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:42.880"> The Moors are very interested, really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:45.320"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:46.540"> Very interesting, aren&#039;t they, in different things?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:48.740"> I think so.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:49.400"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:49.600"> I think it&#039;s fascinating, actually.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:51.220"> It&#039;s so different.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:52.040"> What about fish?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:53.200"> Did you ever get eels in the reed, or...?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:57.020"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:57.560"> Yes, down the bottom of the sluice, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:01.080"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:01.420"> You used to have eels out of there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:02.940"> Did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:03.480"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:04.360"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:05.020"> What, you used to cut them?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:06.240"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:06.840"> I used to love to eat them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:08.060"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:08.600"> So, how did you catch them and cut them?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:10.640"> Oh, you&#039;d catch them with a rod.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:16.560"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:17.040"> And put something on the end of it, you know, and catch them like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:19.480"> And you&#039;d put them in the bucket then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:20.900"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:21.440"> So, as, you know, they&#039;d have fresh water, and then you&#039;d kill them and eat them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:27.100"> How long would you keep...?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:27.880"> I wouldn&#039;t.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:28.700"> He wouldn&#039;t.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:29.500"> Oh, no.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:30.420"> But you would keep them in the fresh bucket for a few days, fresh of water?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:33.500"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:33.720"> Change the water for a day or two, so as they get the, well...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:37.380"> The earthy stuff?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:37.880"> Yes, the earthy stuff.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:39.240"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:39.440"> Otherwise, you&#039;d be eating earth.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:41.400"> So, you would do that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:42.620"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:43.240"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:43.740"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:44.340"> And then you would skin it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:45.900"> Skin it, and then cook it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:47.580"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:47.880"> Fry it in the frying pan, chop it up in bits.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:50.100"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:50.460"> Really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:50.660"> But they were very keen.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:52.460"> I mean, I enjoy anything.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:54.200"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:54.940"> Or everything, put it that way.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:56.660"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:57.140"> I&#039;m not fussy with my food.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:58.560"> I enjoy a lot.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:59.280"> That&#039;s a good free source of food, though.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:01.520"> Yeah, it is, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:02.780"> What about elvers?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:04.020"> Was that something anyone ever had down there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:06.180"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:06.700"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:07.080"> I don&#039;t think so.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:08.220"> No, no.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:09.540"> Down the bottom end of the drive, of course, and they&#039;d have them down there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:16.500"> I need to get them up through the, you know, up the field.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:20.460"> I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve got them under the rostrums.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:22.700"> Did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:23.100"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:23.820"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:24.540"> Yes, yeah, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:25.820"> Crikey.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:26.420"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:27.260"> It&#039;s, um, it&#039;s fascinating, really, isn&#039;t it, when you think back what you&#039;ve seen and done.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:32.300"> What about church?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:33.520"> Did your family ever go to church, you know, when you were down living on?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:37.140"> Yes, I used to go to St Peter&#039;s Church, which is the big church in the village.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:40.440"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:40.820"> But, of course, that closed.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:42.120"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:42.520"> And, um, it&#039;s a house now, prison.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:45.740"> Is that something the whole family would go to?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:48.700"> Uh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:49.500"> Sunday morning.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:50.460"> I used to try and go to church all of Sunday evening.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:52.620"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:52.940"> I mean, Father Prosser was a church warden there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:55.200"> Was he?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:55.720"> During his father.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:56.380"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:56.760"> Oh, yes, he was a big churchman.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:58.360"> Was he?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:59.060"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:00.000"> And Mother used to go.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:00.940"> Mother Prosser used to go.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:02.060"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:02.740"> And they were on occasionally, and, um, they were married in Peterstone Church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:08.720"> But, of course, it closed then, a little while after.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:12.820"> And, um, it&#039;s a house now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:15.620"> People&#039;s got it as a house.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:16.580"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:16.940"> They were living in there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:18.280"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:19.240"> Unfortunately, the gentleman.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:20.460"> They&#039;re dying now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:20.900"> Only last year, um, his wife and the child are still there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:25.520"> But, um, apparently they were.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:27.980"> I&#039;ve never been in there since, naturally.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:30.020"> But they were living in pods.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:32.260"> Were they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:33.120"> It&#039;s a big church, man.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:34.440"> It&#039;s huge.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:34.980"> High.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:35.600"> Crikey.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:36.140"> Tremendous.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:36.620"> Oh, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:37.420"> Tremendous height.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:38.080"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:38.700"> Been up the top of the tower.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:40.240"> Lovely view from there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:41.600"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:42.040"> Mm-hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:43.200"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:43.940"> Would the congregation have been very big?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:47.780"> Um, well, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:49.200"> It varied then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:50.760"> You know, it&#039;s like Marshfield is a bigger church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:53.460"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:53.620"> Or they do get more congregation there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:58.040"> Because I suppose it&#039;s in a bigger village, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:00.040"> Mm-hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:00.500"> And that&#039;s a nice church, too.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:01.940"> It&#039;s a Mary&#039;s church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:03.260"> I&#039;ve got, um, doings.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:05.060"> I&#039;ve got a rose tree down there for doing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:06.760"> But I&#039;ve also got a casket up in the field up here.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:09.580"> Have you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:10.200"> Of his ashes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:11.820"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:12.960"> And, um.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:14.520"> Do you remember any characters that stand out for you or that you remember?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:19.140"> Well, um.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:19.900"> Before the buildings that are over the other side of the road now, there were buildings,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:23.880"> but not like they are now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:26.020"> And there used to be an old fellow living in there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:28.220"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:28.840"> And, um, Dennis, his name was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:31.920"> And, uh, he used to wear a long, long coat.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:35.200"> Uh, he lived in there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:36.660"> And there was a grate in the corner where you&#039;d have a bit of a fireplace if you wanted it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:41.840"> And Dennis, and he&#039;d walk from there then into town, or Rumney.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:45.840"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:46.240"> And walk back.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:46.860"> I can see him now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:47.600"> It was in the stages ago.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:48.820"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:49.140"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:49.380"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:49.500"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:49.580"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:49.840"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:49.900"> He was in a long, long black coat.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:51.320"> And then there was another one down at, um, uh, the farm down at, um, St. Bride&#039;s.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:58.520"> And his name was, um, he was another character.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:04.000"> They, um, oh, I can&#039;t, I can&#039;t think of his name.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:09.200"> He lived in a, in a barn.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:11.780"> Well, they kind of like, I don&#039;t like to use the word tramp, but kind of like a, just somebody</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:16.040"> who used to.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:16.500"> Well, they were, yes, they were kind of a tramp.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:19.900"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:20.380"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:20.740"> You know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:21.020"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:21.500"> And Billy Mitch, that was down there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:23.780"> That&#039;s right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:24.360"> And Dennis used to be in this one that, um, in our, in our barn over there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:28.780"> They were no trouble.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:29.820"> I mean, you know, they, um, actually, I think Father Prosser, uh, went over there one day</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:36.040"> and, and he, he died in the, lost him, so.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:38.840"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:39.300"> Had to get the police and all that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:40.580"> It was a bit of a.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:41.300"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:41.720"> Lost him, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:42.620"> But, um, no, there were characters about then, weren&#039;t there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:45.880"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:46.320"> Years ago like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:47.600"> They&#039;d, um.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:49.360"> Um, uh, well, I can, I can see them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:52.020"> I can place them now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:53.860"> And it&#039;s going back a little while.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:55.780"> Yes, Dennis and, uh, Billy Mitch used to call him.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:58.900"> And he&#039;d always, um, and if the, they&#039;d reckon as if the airplanes were coming over during</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:03.560"> the war, because that was when he was there down the wall.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:06.660"> Um, he turned his pipe upside down in case he&#039;s.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:11.120"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:11.640"> No, that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:12.140"> Oh, isn&#039;t that lovely?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:13.340"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:13.660"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:14.120"> Isn&#039;t that lovely?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:14.600"> It&#039;s a comic moment, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:16.000"> Isn&#039;t it a thing?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:16.740"> Because they might see his pipe.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:18.320"> Oh, right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:18.640"> And he uses it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:20.680"> Oh, it is really funny.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:22.780"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:23.380"> Funny.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:23.860"> Someone was telling me now, where was it now?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:28.400"> I can&#039;t remember.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:30.800"> Oh, something about that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:33.420"> Was it St. Bride&#039;s or was it somewhere else there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:36.440"> I might be wrong.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:37.300"> That on the Sunday the pubs used to be closed in Wales.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:41.140"> This is when the border was different.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:42.960"> So people used to flood over to here to use the pubs on the Sunday.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:46.760"> Is that right?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:47.620"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:48.040"> Maybe I&#039;ve got that wrong.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:49.360"> Um, no, they used to.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:53.820"> There was a law, wasn&#039;t there, where the pubs used to close on the Sunday in a lot of places.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:57.980"> Um.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:59.160"> But I can&#039;t, I can&#039;t remember where that, um, you know, it was, um, wasn&#039;t with ours.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:05.480"> I might have got that wrong, actually.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:07.200"> I mean, it&#039;s, I feel very sad really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:09.560"> The Six Bells is closed.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:11.140"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:11.780"> You know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:12.300"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:12.520"> I mean, and that&#039;s, that was, there was two cottages at the site of that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:16.680"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:17.580"> And, um, I don&#039;t know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:18.020"> It&#039;s, it&#039;s a, it was a, um, was it a popular pub?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:20.880"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:22.180"> Oh, we&#039;ve got a lot of lovely times down there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:24.560"> Have you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:24.960"> Especially Christmas time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:26.100"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:26.420"> You know, we&#039;d go down there and then somebody would be playing the organ.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:29.660"> I mean, have a good old sing-song and that, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:31.940"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:32.340"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:32.700"> And, um, oh, I think I got a photograph.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:36.120"> I&#039;m, I&#039;m boring you with these photographs.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:37.960"> You are not.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:38.340"> I love photographs, Margaret.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:40.080"> I really do love photographs.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:42.600"> Mm-hmm .</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:45.740"> This is the Six Bells.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:47.600"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:48.000"> With all the horses.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:49.920"> No, that&#039;s interesting.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:51.600"> I think I might have seen that photograph before.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:54.360"> Have you? Maybe.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:56.380"> No, I think...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:58.780"> He was the master.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:02.140"> So which pack is this?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:04.560"> This would be the...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:07.760"> What&#039;s it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:09.600"> Tredegar.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:10.240"> Tredegar.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:10.840"> Tredegar hunt, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:11.980"> And this is the one you used to follow in your sports car?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:14.200"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:15.300"> Yes, that&#039;s right, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:17.500"> Oh, and who&#039;s this?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:20.220"> Do you know where this is taken?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:22.620"> No, I&#039;m not certain of that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:25.100"> And see, there was two cottages at the side of the six barrels.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:28.280"> Oh, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:29.500"> And then this is...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:31.540"> What was this, Ken Philp?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:34.720"> Only now, last year.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:37.180"> Because it looks like it&#039;s been closed for years, doesn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:39.300"> Yes, it does, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:40.240"> It looks a bit of a mess, doesn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:41.540"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:42.480"> Yes, it&#039;s a shame because we had a lot of fun down there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:44.880"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:45.600"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:45.960"> I just met, thinking about the St. Melon&#039;s show.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:49.260"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:49.760"> I mean...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:50.220"> That&#039;s folded now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:51.220"> That&#039;s folded.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:51.800"> But I understand that was a huge event in its time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:54.240"> Yes, yes, it was very good.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:55.620"> We had tremendous times with the show.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:58.560"> We used to be on the...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:00.840"> First of all, the St. Melon&#039;s show used to be at Rimley,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:04.940"> on the top of Rimley Hill.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:07.440"> And then it came then to...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:10.900"> Oh, what&#039;s there now?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:12.220"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:14.460"> The only one...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:15.440"> Good.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:15.960"> You know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:17.460"> Bakers used to have the farm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:20.000"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:22.860"> Well, all these...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:23.660"> Oh, dear.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:24.520"> I can&#039;t think of the name.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:28.840"> Oh, that&#039;s silly, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:30.000"> You know, when you go down now towards Newport.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:31.940"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:32.300"> All these buildings on the right-hand side</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:34.560"> and this left-hand side.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:35.740"> Like a radiator plant and...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:37.040"> That&#039;s right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:37.640"> That&#039;s right, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:38.700"> Suffering.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:39.040"> We used to have the show there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:40.460"> Did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:40.880"> And then we came then to Kevin Mabley here</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:42.620"> down the bottom of this lane.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:43.920"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:44.060"> Where you came over the bridge.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:45.000"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:45.240"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:45.460"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:45.800"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:45.960"> Farm Park.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:46.560"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:46.920"> We used to have it there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:48.060"> Oh, really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:48.780"> Yes, in the big field there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:49.800"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:50.420"> And, oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:52.780"> And then we went then to Jadica House.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:55.180"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:55.640"> But it was never the same.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:57.240"> Not really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:58.440"> You know, we used to get...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:59.700"> I don&#039;t know why it was</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:01.060"> because it was a nice site.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:03.040"> But we didn&#039;t get the agricultural side of things.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:06.400"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:06.680"> It changed.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:07.620"> It changed altogether.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:09.100"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:09.500"> So where it was used to be by Koikernu...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:12.220"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:12.720"> What was it...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:13.420"> So where that area is now,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:15.040"> it&#039;s completely developed.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:15.960"> It&#039;s developed, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:16.640"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:17.120"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:17.460"> Was it just farmland then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:18.740"> It was farmland.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:19.760"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:20.180"> It&#039;s hard to imagine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:21.560"> It is.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:22.100"> It is, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:22.920"> So before the motorway and everything,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:25.420"> it was...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:26.460"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:26.800"> Well, of course,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:27.280"> they were talking about putting another road up</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:29.920"> onto the motorway.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:31.700"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:32.240"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:32.640"> I don&#039;t know where that&#039;s going to happen.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:33.680"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:34.120"> But it was just farmland?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:35.560"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:35.880"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:36.640"> Because you still live there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:38.100"> And it was where all the local farmers</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:40.420"> would go along there,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:41.380"> would they,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:41.800"> to present,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:43.040"> show their livestock?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:44.940"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:45.340"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:45.960"> It was a proper agriculture show.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:47.080"> Oh, yes, it was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:47.780"> Definitely.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:48.280"> Everything was there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:49.380"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:49.820"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:50.500"> And the local show now is Mackenshow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:54.060"> OK.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:54.720"> And that&#039;s...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:54.980"> I was on the first Saturday of July.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:56.880"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:57.120"> And that&#039;s a nice little show.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:58.360"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:58.800"> And that&#039;s as big as what St. Melon&#039;s was,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:00.740"> you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:01.420"> But, oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:03.460"> Oh, yes, we&#039;ve had a lot of fun at the shows.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:05.660"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:06.200"> Lovely.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:07.200"> But there are things altered,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:09.200"> aren&#039;t there,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:09.520"> over the years?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:09.960"> Yeah, they do.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:10.580"> You know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:11.360"> I was just going to ask you about the Lighthouse pub.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:14.260"> Is that something that...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:16.080"> Locals would have ever used.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:17.520"> Was it something people from out of town would use?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:21.400"> Have you been down to the Lighthouse pub?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:23.260"> Oh, it&#039;s very pleasant.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:24.560"> And a lot of people used to walk on the bank,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:26.760"> you know, across the bank.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:27.880"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:28.420"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:28.720"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:29.260"> What, would people walk along from Cardiff along here?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:32.560"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:32.860"> Well, yeah, sort of from Remedy, perhaps, you know,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:35.320"> walk and then see them go back and that, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:38.120"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:38.500"> Yes, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:39.580"> Oh, it&#039;s very pleasant.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:40.760"> And there is a nice day.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:41.840"> Yeah, it is.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:42.480"> It&#039;s nice.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:42.900"> You know, it&#039;s...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:43.960"> You go up and you can see</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:45.080"> both sides.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:46.100"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:47.020"> I&#039;m sure he was telling me that</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:48.760"> that people used to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:52.700"> stay in almost like a chalet,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:54.920"> a seat shack</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:56.180"> in...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:57.520"> in...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:57.580"> on the...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:58.360"> by the sea wall.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:59.500"> Is that right?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:00.300"> At St. Bride&#039;s.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:01.220"> At St. Bride&#039;s?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:02.080"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:02.340"> Or was it...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:02.940"> They&#039;ve got caravans there now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:05.040"> I don&#039;t think he meant the caravan,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:06.620"> that people would rent out...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:08.760"> would come out for the weekend and...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:10.280"> Maybe he did mean the caravan, actually.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:12.600"> I didn&#039;t think he did mean that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:14.400"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:15.080"> Maybe I got that wrong.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:16.220"> He said people would come out for the day</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:18.020"> on their bikes and...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:20.000"> Oh, a lot of people used to go</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:21.260"> to St. Bride&#039;s.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:22.740"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:23.060"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:23.760"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:24.140"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:24.720"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:25.520"> And of course they&#039;d have these little</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:27.500"> tent things, wouldn&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:28.820"> Oh, really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:29.580"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:30.820"> You see those down there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:32.240"> What?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:32.500"> Like people would camp?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:33.700"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:34.340"> They&#039;d sleep in there and then...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:35.740"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:36.360"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:36.880"> But what...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:37.500"> Along by the wall?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:38.720"> Or...?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:39.160"> Um, not so much the wall,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:40.500"> but before they put the caravan sites,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:43.400"> because they&#039;re a fair bit of caravan sites,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:45.080"> I did St. Bride&#039;s apparently.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:46.260"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:46.520"> Which I haven&#039;t been there for years.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:48.360"> Excuse me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:49.500"> And, um, they used to have these little tent things,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:53.380"> you know, you see it on the television, don&#039;t you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:55.360"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:56.020"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:56.400"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:56.780"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:57.140"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:57.840"> Oh, I didn&#039;t know that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:59.080"> Yes, it&#039;s...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:00.100"> Yes, times have changed, haven&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:02.480"> Yeah, they have.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:03.660"> They have.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:04.740"> I said, it&#039;s one thing I have to ask you about,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:06.640"> because I was asking about it,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:07.740"> because part of what I&#039;m doing is, um,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:09.900"> maybe talking to people who live along the moors,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:13.020"> but, um, that includes people,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:14.860"> people from the Gypsy community.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:16.480"> Mm-hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:16.920"> Um, do you remember any Gypsies coming through and...?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:22.360"> Well, when we had ground in, um,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:24.120"> we rented ground on the corner down in St. Bride&#039;s,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:26.820"> in, um, um...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:30.100"> Uh...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:31.680"> Well, where the Gypsy caravan is,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:33.340"> that site is now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:34.480"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:34.860"> Uh, there used to be the old...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:37.560"> She was an old Gypsy in the proper old...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:40.620"> Uh...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:41.060"> Rangtongue.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:41.920"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:42.120"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:42.640"> And they were there for years on the corner,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:44.860"> and they were out of our field,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:45.740"> and we used to have to just pass them, you know,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:47.780"> to go into the field.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:49.060"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:49.360"> And they&#039;d give no trouble at all.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:50.700"> But these are not Gypsies, are they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:52.680"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:53.000"> Not being unkind, they&#039;re travellers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:54.640"> No, I know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:54.960"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:55.720"> You know?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:56.100"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:56.580"> And, I mean, I mean, they got horses tethered,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:00.220"> and, uh, well, a friend of mine,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:01.860"> she saw this little tiny pony one day,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:04.040"> and she thought the pull...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:05.500"> I don&#039;t know, any tweets.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:07.060"> She came home and took some hay down to give it on the road.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:10.100"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:10.520"> You know?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:11.260"> It&#039;s sad.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:12.100"> No, these are travellers more, I think.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:13.740"> You know, it&#039;s...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:14.860"> They&#039;re not the proper Gypsy.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:16.120"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:16.700"> I don&#039;t think.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:18.640"> There we are.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:19.520"> That&#039;s life, I suppose, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:20.980"> It is, I suppose.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:22.280"> And there&#039;s so many of them now, isn&#039;t there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:24.380"> So, do you know, you go towards Cardiff and Rumley,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:27.680"> from where I live now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:29.000"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:29.320"> I mean, again, when you first arrived,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:31.940"> was that just agricultural land?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:34.520"> Oh, yes, all just fields.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:35.940"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:36.380"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:36.760"> It&#039;s hard for me to imagine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:38.980"> Yes, yes, mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:40.680"> Yes, and, of course, there&#039;s the, um,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:43.540"> uh, KLG.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:44.420"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:44.860"> Which is a bit firm opposite, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:46.440"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:47.120"> Uh, do motor things.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:49.700"> But, uh, oh, yes, it was all...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:52.080"> It&#039;s most unfortunate.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:53.320"> I mean, there&#039;s a little house there as you go down</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:55.560"> towards, um, the caravan site.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:58.660"> On the right-hand side, um, he was the coalman,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:02.100"> Mr Sadler.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:03.360"> And I look at it now and I think to myself,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:05.540"> oh, if he came back and saw us...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:07.520"> Right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:08.280"> Yeah, he&#039;d be very, very upset about it, you know?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:11.040"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:11.760"> He was the

some time, actually.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:26.460"> But as the house was, it was immaculate, you know?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:29.480"> But as it is now, the slates are gone and...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:32.480"> Oh, it&#039;s, it&#039;s a mess.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:34.780">

class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:09.480"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:10.140"> On the left-hand side, as you go down off the main road.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:14.140"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:14.800"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:15.360"> She used to go

data-time="00:58:44.140"> Not really, I suppose.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:45.300"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:45.800"> No, the grass is the same.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:47.160"> It&#039;s green.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:47.840"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:48.260"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:49.180"> And you drove, drove a tractor from early on?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:51.800"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:52.600"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:53.180"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:53.460"> I drove, I drove, when we moved from Langorse down to Berryhill, um, on a Ferguson, Ferguson</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:01.540"> 25, excuse me, um, I did three journeys from Langorse down to Berryhill.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:06.360"> It took me four and a half hours.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:08.400"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:08.840"> With the trailer behind, with implements and stuff.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:11.340"> Brought them down to Berryhill Farm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:13.920"> And, um, and then when I was going back, do you know the way, do you know, um, Pontypool</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:19.240"> area much?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:20.320"> You know, I...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:21.220"> I&#039;ve been to Pontyboil recently.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:23.220"> Pontyboil?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:23.620"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:24.040"> All right, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:24.820"> Well, when you go, um, it wasn&#039;t the new road then, because I wouldn&#039;t have been able to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:28.840"> go on the new road anyway.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:30.080"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:30.480"> No, you wouldn&#039;t be able to go on the motorway, uh, you know, with a tractor.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:33.700"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:33.920"> It wasn&#039;t the same then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:35.920"> Um, and, uh, I used to go down past the Holston Jockey on the bottom, and I used to go down</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:40.940"> the hill and knock it out of gear.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:42.320"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:42.720"> And I&#039;d go down that hill like the crappers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:44.540"> And I often think, well, what if something came across the road?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:48.340"> I wouldn&#039;t have a chance.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:49.520"> Oh, my goodness.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:50.500"> You do things when you&#039;re young, don&#039;t you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:51.820"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:53.960"> Yeah, I did three journeys, that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:56.100"> I brought the plough up, and I brought a big trailer up with implements on.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:00.380"> And, uh, yes, it took me four and a half hours to come down.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:03.520"> And were you the only child?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:04.720"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:05.280"> Ah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:05.620"> I haven&#039;t even got a cousin.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:07.620"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:08.200"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:08.440"> But my, my two aunts didn&#039;t marry.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:10.640"> My one aunt did marry.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:11.960"> We didn&#039;t have no family.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:13.320"> And then my, my, um, uncle, he married.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:15.960"> He didn&#039;t marry.</div></div><br>

            <h2>B</h2>
            <div class="transcript_container"><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:00.620"> and I&#039;m just going to say at the top of the tape that I&#039;m Marsha Marnie and I&#039;m</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:04.820"> with Margaret Prosser and I can&#039;t say the name of your farm what&#039;s the name of</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:08.660"> the farm? Cronin&#039;s farm and it&#039;s Rudry. Rudry? Yes, near Caffilly. I thought we were near Caffilly and it is Friday September the 6th 2019 so I&#039;m just gonna pop that down there</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:25.960"> and when we were coming over the hill I could see I thought are we near Caffilly? I couldn&#039;t believe it I didn&#039;t think we were that close. Yeah you came up this road here. Yeah, yeah. So you&#039;re looking across there it&#039;s a different perspective because it&#039;s gorgeous looking across the levels there isn&#039;t it? Yes, yes it is. Yes, yes, yes. And then when you get on the top there you can see Clevedon Pier. Really? That&#039;s amazing. I might have to come back when it&#039;s a clearer day. Yes that&#039;s right. Yes it&#039;s not so clear to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:55.880"> today. No. I suppose we&#039;ve had it rain this morning and that it makes it more limited. You&#039;ve met Marjorie Neal have you? Yes I&#039;ve met Marjorie. Yes, yes. Are you related to her? No, no we&#039;re great friends. Oh really? Oh really? In Farmers days. Oh crikey. Yes, yes, yes. Oh yeah everyone&#039;s it&#039;s so lovely everyone I have to say Margaret that everyone I&#039;ve met have been just adorable and so open and welcoming it&#039;s just such so lovely making my job so much easier.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:24.080"> Because Marjorie was born down on the Moors. Yeah. Would you know Steph Davis? Oh what&#039;s her maiden name? I can&#039;t think of her maiden name now. She was born at Lower Newton House I think. Stephanie. Stephanie.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:47.400"> I can&#039;t think of her maiden name. I can&#039;t think of her maiden name now. I&#039;ll think of it. But I wonder if we can just start off if you could just tell us when you were born and where you were born.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:58.740"> And I was born at 31 Herbert Avenue, Risker. As I say my mother was a farmer&#039;s daughter and my father was in the steel works you know. And we moved from there then to Park Place at Risker.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:15.900"> And we lived there for quite a few years. And then we moved from there then and took the farm at Langoes. And that was 19... oh dear... 1946, 1947. That&#039;s right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:31.140"> And then I moved back down then to Slewis in 1956 when I married. Dear Wim.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:38.240"> So what was your father&#039;s name? William Benjamin Thomas. And your mother? Minnie Harris. Oh that&#039;s a nice name, Minnie. So your father worked in the steel works you said. Where?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:50.320"> In Pontimister Steelworks which is not there at the moment. That was taken down some years ago. Was that in Newport?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:57.120"> Risker. Pontimister Risker. Yeah. So he wasn&#039;t a farmer at all?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:02.980"> No. No. No. No. And then he had his sister Evelyn Mary Thomas and she was 44 years in Risker at a radio in a letter to shop.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:13.660"> And then his other sister, Aunty Phyllis, Phyllis Thomas, she was a teacher up in Abercrombie.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:22.620"> And they lived in... I&#039;ve got to think of the name of the place now. Oh dear, it&#039;s terrible. They lived in Woodland Drive in Rogerstone.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:35.220"> I don&#039;t know whether you know that area, do you? Do you go to Risker at all?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:38.580"> Not very well at all, no. You don&#039;t? No, no. You go up through Woodland Drive, Rogerstone up to Risker and then of course you carry on up the valley then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:45.280"> So your mother was from a farming background? Yes, yes. Where was she from?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:49.840"> Near a house farm, Pantig, near Pontipur. Or New Inn it was really. So how did she meet your father?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:57.140"> Well I think my grandparents on my father&#039;s side lived in New Inn and I think daddy should go back and forth to see them and that&#039;s how they met I suppose.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:10.480"> It&#039;s funny how people do meet, don&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:12.800"> So your father had to learn how to be a farmer then, presumably?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:16.380"> Yes, he was always interested. His cousin used to keep the Mardie farm, Kukunu, just below the Kukunu Gulf Coast.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:23.160"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:23.840"> And he spent a lot of time there. So that&#039;s, you know, he really got fed up with the, as the saying is in the stairworks.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:31.960"> So he thought they&#039;d branch out and they had this farm in Langoes then. And we took that over Lock, Stock and Barra. We took over the, when they say Lock, Stock and Barra, we took over the stock and rented the farm there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:43.840"> Okay. Yes. Langoes and I liked Langoes very much. We looked out for the door and you could see the Penavan.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:52.220"> Oh he has. Yes. And 1947 was a winter. Oh terrible.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:56.040"> Was it really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:57.120"> Oh shocking yes. I mean we had tremendous snow. The milk didn&#039;t go from there with the lorry for over a week.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:04.140"> Wow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:04.760"> Because we were snowed up.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:05.920"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:06.280"> Right to the hedges.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:07.500"> Crikey.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:07.820"> And then there was a camp of Italians at Bolch and there was another, the Germans in, Italian, German soldiers in Brecon and they cut through really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:22.740"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:23.140"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:23.680"> Yes. It was, it was horrendous. So, and then I used to go to school in Brecon then from Langoes and walk up to the, hell I used to hate school.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:33.820"> I&#039;d rather be home doing the work there. And, um, there was a cycle sometimes, but walk at the times and I used to really dawdle you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:43.620"> And then I&#039;d hear the train coming around from Talgat to Brecon and stop at the Langoes Hall and I&#039;d try to, but no I never got there and I came home.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:51.440"> And then my father, I said, look you cannot do this you see. You must, you have got to go to school.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:56.160"> And I said, well I don&#039;t like school. So I left when I was 15. So, uh, that was my story of schooling in Brecon.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:03.920"> Crikey.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:05.160"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:05.600"> So how old were you when your family moved down here? Or when I say here, over there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:10.940"> Oh, to Berryhill.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:12.220"> When, so, where is Berryhill?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:13.900"> It&#039;s on the main road, go through Castleton.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:16.660"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:16.800"> To Newport.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:18.100"> And before you get down to where there&#039;s a big, uh, walk over the bridge.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:23.220"> Yes, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:23.440"> Well, it&#039;s on the right hand side.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:25.020"> Oh really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:25.320"> Before you get there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:26.240"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:26.720"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:27.040"> It&#039;s not there now. Is it gone? Is it all gone?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:29.540"> No, the farm is still there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:30.880"> Is still there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:31.260"> Well, they were, uh, pick your own. But, um, they, they, they, they haven&#039;t done that for some time now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:37.660"> And, um, there&#039;s a bungalow that&#039;s built next to it, uh, which the person that took over after my mother and father finished, uh, he was there for some time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:47.040"> Um, well I tell you who was there was Robert Peel. You know, Robert Peel, the, or something, it&#039;s his grandson, but his name is Robert.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:53.380"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:54.120"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:54.640"> Amazing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:55.840"> So why did your parents move from Nangorse? Why did they come here?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:00.140"> Well, because, um, well, it was a bit, a bit bigger farm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:04.000"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:04.460"> And, uh, we like this area more because my parents, well, my father particularly moved from this area.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:09.860"> And, as I say, his, um, his cousin used to farm the farm down below, so he&#039;s, there&#039;s quite a lot of, you know, there with them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:17.480"> And then, so, so, did your parents move to Sluice Farm or was that you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:22.480"> No, I moved to Sluice Farm. I married from Berryhill and I married Dillwyn from Sluice Farm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:27.920"> So how did you meet Dillwyn?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:29.540"> Oh, Young Farmers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:31.920"> It&#039;s quite, it&#039;s quite a matrimonial place to meet. Yes, Young Farmers, that we should belong to.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:38.180"> So was it very active then, Young Farmers?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:40.800"> Yes, we were, yes. Um, St. Maryns Young Farmers went under. But I did belong to the Llynne Sluice Farm in Brecon, or Langorse, when I was there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:50.940"> And, um, yes, we were quite active, you know. Yes, we were fun, different, go to different shows and so forth, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:58.060"> But, um, oh yes, it&#039;s quite a matrimonial place to the Young Farmers, I think.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:03.580"> Really? Yes. I&#039;ve heard that so many times, people who&#039;ve met through Young, it must be an informal marriage bureau. Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:12.380"> Crikey.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:13.240"> Oh yes, yes. So it&#039;s, um...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:15.380"> So you met Dillwyn and then he was already living at...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:18.500"> He was born down Sluice.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:19.760"> He was born there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:20.940"> Yes, yes. And he&#039;s got two sisters. One is Betty, which is two years younger, older. And she&#039;s living in Gloucester. She&#039;s 90 now. And then, um, the other sister lived at, um, did you see who met Derek?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:36.140"> Yeah. Well, Derek&#039;s mother was his sister to Dillwyn.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:39.560"> Oh, okay. Doreen. Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:41.040"> She died, um, oh, she wasn&#039;t very old. She was quite with cancer, bad. And, um, very sad it was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:47.000"> Yeah. And, um, sorry, Derek from... So, how have we met? How did you come to meet Derek, excuse me, ask it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:53.160"> Uh, well, Derek and Andrew were both through John Southall, who worked for the drainage board.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:58.100"> Ah, right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:59.140"> Yeah. Yeah. So he&#039;s a chap that goes round cleaning them and...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:02.820"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:02.900"> ...you know, talking to all the landowners and stuff. So, John introduced me to... He said, you&#039;ve got to speak to Derek and Andrew Prosser.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:09.680"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:10.500"> So that... And then that&#039;s why I&#039;m here now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:12.940"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:13.200"> Yeah. Very grateful to him.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:14.660"> Yeah. Well, my, um, Father Prosser, he was on the drainage board and he was supposed to lend him to different meetings and that, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:20.520"> So that&#039;s, um, Dillwyn&#039;s father.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:23.660"> So what was his full name?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:25.120"> Winford. Winford Prosser.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:27.000"> Winford Prosser. So what...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:28.140"> And his wife was living at Lansoy. And I don&#039;t know how they met. Um, uh, let me see. I think, I think Dillwyn&#039;s father had a, a housekeeper.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:40.140"> And then, um, my mother-in-law, Marjorie, she was Marjorie, she came down to meet her.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:46.560"> And then, uh, they seemed to pat... to get friendly and then they married, you see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:51.780"> I love that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:52.160"> Yeah. So Lansoy, Lansoy, uh, at the side desk.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:55.980"> So what was, um, uh, sorry, what was his name? Winford?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:59.880"> Winford.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:00.480"> Winford.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:00.940"> So he was on the drainage board, you see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:03.600"> Yes, yes. And Dillwyn was on the drainage board.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:05.600"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:05.800"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:06.700"> So I&#039;m getting confused. So Winford is Dillwyn&#039;s father.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:09.180"> That&#039;s right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:09.760"> So Winford was on the drainage board. So what do, what can you tell me about Dillwyn&#039;s parents and on the farm and...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:17.060"> Uh, well, um, Dillwyn&#039;s dad, um, Winford, um, has got a brother, I&#039;m sure he photographs out there afterwards. Um, Campbell Prosser. He was a barrister of law. And he was out abroad for a long time in Singapore.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:31.500"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:32.600"> And then he had a sister, um, which I&#039;ve got the photograph, the whole family&#039;s out there, you can see later in. And, um, then he had a sister that lived in, um, in Cardiff Road. Uh, and then, um, um, Missy Campbell. And then there was Dillwyn who was killed in the war, First World War. And, um, I was Winford, um, well, I&#039;ll have to, I can show you the photo.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:01.480"> I want, it&#039;s on the wall, so it&#039;s easy for you to have a look at it on the wall, really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:05.960"> Yeah. Yeah. So that was, like, that was Dillwyn&#039;s father&#039;s side, you see. And do you know...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:10.300"> And they had butcher shops in Cardiff, Clifton Street. Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:14.300"> There&#039;s a big butcher in there. And, um, that was their business, more or less, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:19.040"> So, but, a butcher shop. Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:22.200"> Butcher shop. So, how, when, when did the farm come into the...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:26.280"> Oh, Winford, um, he wasn&#039;t keen on the butcher shop, so he went farming then. So he took over, took sluice then, rented sluice.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:34.780"> Oh, right. And then, of course, milk. And then he used to have a milk round, uh, with a milk van and everything.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:40.540"> And, um, Dillwyn used to go occasionally when his father had a meeting up in London, but, uh, he wasn&#039;t so keen on the, on the milk round.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:49.720"> But, uh, he used to do it when his father had to go to London for meetings with the drainage board and that, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:55.500"> So why did they have meetings in London?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:58.220"> I, I, I don&#039;t know, really. It&#039;s, um, and of course they used to have the meetings out at, um, Maygut, didn&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:05.960"> Yeah. That&#039;s the place, is it Maygut? Yes, Maygut, isn&#039;t it? They used to have the...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:10.740"> Oh, Nash. Nash, rather. That&#039;s right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:12.860"> Oh, Pike Corner. That&#039;s right, Pike Corner.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:14.900"> Yeah. Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:15.540"> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so, uh...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:18.620"> So, uh, was it, was it a, always a dairy farm then, the Sleuths farm?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:23.240"> Yes. Yes. Yes. They had cow, we had cows and everything, and sheep. But, um, and then we moved up here later,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:30.980"> and then, um, they moved there, but then they went out to the cows, and so the Andrews only got the sheep at the moment.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:37.460"> So then you met, um, Dillwyn?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:40.160"> Three young farmers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:41.340"> Three young farmers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:42.120"> And so, um, uh, what, so where did you marry, actually?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:46.660"> In Criccourney Church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:48.100"> Oh, did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:48.560"> It&#039;s a dear little church, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:49.940"> It&#039;s a house now that&#039;s been turned into a...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:51.820"> Yes, Criccourney.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:52.600"> Do you know, um, do you know, um, well, you know the main road I said about where this arch goes,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:58.060"> you&#039;re turned down for Criccourney for the golf course.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:00.760"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:00.880"> And it&#039;s just before you get to the golf course. Or just after the golf course, sorry.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:05.540"> On the right?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:05.880"> On the left hand side you&#039;ve got a little lane up to the church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:09.360"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:09.960"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:10.400"> Oh, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve been to the church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:12.300"> Oh, I haven&#039;t. It&#039;s a house now, it&#039;s, um...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:14.720"> Was it a chapel then, or a chapel?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:16.280"> No, a church. Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:17.920"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:18.560"> Yeah, Criccourney Church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:19.180"> Oh, I have to go back that way afterwards, I might go and have a look.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:22.460"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:23.140"> I had no idea.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:24.360"> And, um, I think there&#039;s three or four houses there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:27.380"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:27.980"> Uh, because there was a farm next to it, but they&#039;ve gone into, into homesteads, you see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:32.480"> Hmm. So then, so did you then start your married life at Seuss Farm?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:36.660"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:37.340"> You moved in with, with your in-laws?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:39.540"> Yes. No, no, they moved, they built a house. Do you see the house on the side?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:43.220"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:43.580"> They built that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:44.400"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:45.120"> And then we went into the farmhouse and they built that and went into there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:49.760"> So this would have been, what, the mid-50s?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:52.700"> Yes, 57.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:54.280"> 57?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:55.320"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:55.760"> So, um, so what was the farm doing then? Was it...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:59.300"> Milk.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:00.180"> Milk.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:00.580"> Milk, and milk round.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:01.900"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:02.440"> Yeah, and they fill the bottles, you know, and wash the bottles then in the little shed that was there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:07.420"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:07.940"> That&#039;s, um, yes, I&#039;ve got a photograph here. Excuse me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:13.940"> How many cows did you have, Margaret?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:16.760"> Pardon?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:17.220"> How many cows did you have?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:19.440"> Uh, well, not like they got today, they got hundreds today, haven&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:22.520"> And they made about 125.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:24.300"> Oh, that&#039;s dope.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:25.080"> Which is quite, you know, big for those days, I suppose, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:28.120"> You know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:28.840"> Nice to get a photograph here, I think, aren&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:32.880"> And that wasn&#039;t all hand-milt, was it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:36.200"> Had it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:36.800"> Was that all milked by hand?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:38.240"> Well, it was years ago, and then they, of course, they went in with the machines then, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:45.180"> This is a photograph of a sluice house.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:48.040"> This was before 1963.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:52.600"> That&#039;s where it was when I used to live there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:54.680"> Oh, crikey.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:55.220"> There was a milk found by there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:57.040"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:57.440"> A dairy there, where they used to rust in the bottles.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:00.660"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:01.040"> Cows used to go into there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:02.440"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:02.820"> And then this was the garden.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:04.180"> I mean, Anne&#039;s got a beautiful garden down there now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:06.360"> Wow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:07.000"> And then there was a shed where we kept chickens.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:09.300"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:09.920"> Um, so it all altered, of course, because all of us is buildings here now, is it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:14.060"> This is all changed, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:15.480"> Yeah, all definitely.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:16.000"> I mean, it&#039;s all built up.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:17.260"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:17.500"> Very rural then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:18.540"> Yes, yes, yes, it was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:20.100"> Thank you.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:21.220"> And then in this field here, which Father Potter was in the wound, that&#039;s where they built the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:26.060"> house, you can see Wyvern.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:27.660"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:28.380"> You know, they built that there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:29.860"> Did they build that because Dillwyn was getting married?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:33.680"> Yes, yes, they built that to go in there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:36.200"> And, um, oh, but I was only thinking the other day, I think it was about 90, oh, I&#039;ve forgotten</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:44.380"> about it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:45.100"> I was thinking about how much it cost the other day.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:48.420"> The bridge cost nearly more to get across the Ream to get to the house than the house,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:53.340"> I think.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:53.740"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:54.500"> Yes, it was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:55.080"> You forget about that, don&#039;t you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:57.000"> Yes, you do.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:57.620"> You have to get across the Ream.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:58.360"> That&#039;s true.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:58.900"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:00.140"> So what were your first impressions when you moved down there and started married life?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:04.720"> Um, well, I used to go back and forth there before we were actually married, you know,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:08.580"> and have supper and things with my mother-in-law and that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:12.440"> Yeah, and, um, yes, well, I liked it very much because we had grown with Berryhill, we had</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:19.320"> two fields on the moors as we call them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:21.660"> Okay, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:22.420"> That rented those and, um, so it wasn&#039;t any different for me really, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:28.960"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:29.340"> And then, of course, we used to go to Young Farmers Club in St Melons.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:33.940"> Did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:34.480"> Yes, yes, and the chapel there used to hold the Young Farmers meetings.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:38.120"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:38.440"> That&#039;s, uh, oh yes, I&#039;ve enjoyed life.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:41.480"> There was a farmer&#039;s wife, so I&#039;ve spoken to lots of farmers, and, um, so as a farmer&#039;s</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:46.980"> wife would you, would you have been aware of and concerned with all the Reams and the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:53.280"> maintenance and stuff?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:54.620"> I mean, I guess what I&#039;m trying to ask is, was there very much a clear, this was what</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:59.320"> the woman did and this is what the men did, or was it all mixed up?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:03.420"> Um, well, I think, I, I, I used to enjoy going out and feeding calves and things and that,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:09.280"> you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:10.120"> And then when I was born, we used to put him in the pram, put him in the corner of the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:14.000"> milking shed, and he&#039;d be sat there, you know, watching the cows coming in and out and</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:18.200"> in the house and, um, before we had a parlour that was, the milking parlour type of thing,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:24.260"> you know, where you could get up in the house.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:26.500"> But, um, yeah, I&#039;ve always been, I&#039;ve always been interested outside.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:31.400"> Um, so I used to spend quite a bit of time before we went to Langhorst with my, my grandparents</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:37.520"> in Newhouse Farm, Pantake.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:39.380"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:39.860"> You know, I just go up there and stay when I was a little tot, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:42.980"> Put me on the bus in Newport and my aunt would meet me in the way.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:46.880"> How lovely.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:48.160"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:48.480"> So, did you ever get involved in the bottling of milk down there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:52.240"> I used to help sometimes and that helped, um, well, Father Prosser used to, you know,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:57.200"> mostly he&#039;d do that, so I&#039;d have to come back off the round and then wash the bottles and</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:01.760"> get them ready then to fill up the next morning. You know, it&#039;s, uh, yeah. Oh yes. Oh yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:08.400"> Oh yes, I&#039;ve had a, I&#039;ve had a very enjoyable life really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:11.580"> That&#039;s, you can tell that it shows in your face.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:14.140"> Oh, does it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:14.640"> Yeah, it does.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:16.000"> What about the poultry? Was that the important part of the, the family?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:19.260"> Yeah, we used to sell eggs on the, on the milk crumb quite a lot, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:23.460"> And then there was, if there was any surplus eggs then, uh, I used to bring them to the husband brothers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:28.440"> They used to have, um, uh, uh, well, I don&#039;t know, what do you call it, an egg, um, centre</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:36.100"> that they would have eggs and then they&#039;d take them out on different rounds.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:39.640"> Where were the husband brothers based?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:41.080"> Uh, it&#039;s, it&#039;s, um, Lisbon.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:44.320"> Oh really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:45.120"> Yes, yes. But that&#039;s all different now altogether.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:48.200"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:48.440"> You know, it&#039;s, places change, don&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:50.520"> Yeah. Well, it&#039;s interesting, look at the new photograph, because you must have seen enormous change in your lifetime down there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:57.420"> Oh yes, yeah, especially now, uh, more buildings up for stock and everything, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:02.700"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:03.180"> And, um, I mean, I, I was trying to keep, well, clean tidy and all this, because, and we used to have a boy living in then, you see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:10.080"> Did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:10.480"> Yes, yes, you know the, um, excuse me, you know the kitchen.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:15.300"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:15.560"> You&#039;re going for the back door, don&#039;t you? Well, that&#039;s the dining room, the kitchen for every day.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:20.400"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:20.600"> Then there&#039;s the kitchen, isn&#039;t there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:22.000"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:22.260"> Then there&#039;s the other room.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:23.380"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:23.500"> Well, we used to have a boy living in there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:25.540"> Did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:26.220"> Yes, yeah. And, um, he had his bed in there, and there was a stove in the corner. We used to have for the fire, and he had an armchair.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:33.460"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:33.600"> He always ate with us.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:35.000"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:35.560"> And, um, yes, so, um, we always had a boy living in.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:39.360"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:39.560"> And, and who, who was he? Was it a series of people, or?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:42.940"> Um, well, yes, different, we, we had a few from some brides that didn&#039;t live in there, came back and forth, which is, you know, from, or, Cucurney.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:50.920"> But, um, a couple of state elves actually lived in there, you know, with us, and they&#039;d eat with us and all this business, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:58.500"> But, um, I mean, he had a television, well, not a television, a wireless more like, but he did have a television towards the end.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:05.320"> And, um, yes, we always had a boy living in.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:08.300"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:08.540"> I suppose the, the farm could support that, whereas it&#039;d be difficult to do that today, wouldn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:13.900"> Well, I suppose, yes, it&#039;s different, it&#039;s the different ideas today, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:17.920"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:18.160"> It&#039;s, um, different world today, really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:21.380"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:21.560"> It&#039;s changed a lot, really, with farming, hasn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:24.220"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:24.320"> Well, did you have sheep, then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:26.140"> Yes, we&#039;ve had some sheep, yeah, pet lambs and something, you know, feed those, and, yes, we had, it&#039;s, it&#039;s, it&#039;s, I can&#039;t remember how many, um, sheep,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:34.420"> we didn&#039;t have so many sheep as well now, naturally, because we had the dairy in as well, you see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:38.980"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:39.440"> It&#039;s, um, yes, oh yes, I&#039;ve enjoyed my, um, my life until now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:47.260"> So, Ant, um, used to go up onto the sea wall and bring the sheep in on ponies.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:51.880"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:52.220"> Did you ever get involved with that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:53.840"> No, not really, no, no.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:55.880"> Um, yes, we put sheep over on the sea wall.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:58.820"> And then, um, uh, my Doreen, uh, Derek&#039;s father, Philip, would come over and, uh, they&#039;d have this horse and a little trap thing, you know, and they&#039;d sit in there and then, they&#039;d, they&#039;d go up then to get onto the buss and to bring the sheep up and all this business, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:14.540"> And then one day, um, I don&#039;t know what happened, but anyhow, the, the pony started kicking the bottom of the buss and, of course, got out of the, out of the showers and left these four or five and the buss and went backwards where it was suffering.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:30.600"> What, backwards down the slope?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:32.000"> Well, it went back, it went back, back, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:34.060"> Oh, I see, because the horse had gone.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:35.540"> And there was the showers hanging up on the wall.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:37.820"> Were they okay?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:39.140"> Well, they were alright.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:40.060"> And the dog jumped out a bit quick.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:42.260"> And the dog was in as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:44.100"> Oh dear, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:45.400"> They used to come over every Sunday and go down and see the sheep and something or sort of those out and bring that for us then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:52.040"> Because the sheep used to graze on the other side of them?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:54.400"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:56.120"> And then to, like, um, the tide used to come in so far, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:01.280"> But they hired the, um, I think they hired the bank then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:05.960"> Um, yes, they did hire it because, of course, the sea, the water was coming, the sea was getting in higher, wasn&#039;t it, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:14.160"> Because you&#039;re very close to the sea wall there, aren&#039;t you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:16.740"> Oh, yes, it&#039;s on the field really, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:18.960"> The field across.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:19.680"> Did you ever experience the water coming over?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:22.400"> You see it sometimes if it was very rough, just splashing up a bit, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:26.980"> But, um, you know, I never had the thought in mind of thinking, oh gosh, I hope it doesn&#039;t come over there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:34.540"> Never thought of that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:35.880"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:36.140"> Which I suppose it has, well, it&#039;s had in some places over the years, isn&#039;t it, you see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:40.760"> Did you ever use the shore where the sheep graze?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:43.720"> Is there like a picnic spot when you had children were little?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:46.140"> Yeah, we used to go over there and, um, like, in a lot of the, have you been over there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:52.220"> You&#039;ve been over there, of course.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:53.820"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:54.560"> Well, I haven&#039;t been over there for years really, so I don&#039;t know what it&#039;s like.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:57.700"> But, we used to have little, little, um, re, what&#039;s the terms of water coming in where there&#039;s been bits of ditches?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:04.020"> Yeah, like rivulets.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:05.520"> Yes, yes, yes, mm-hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:07.320"> Yeah, yes, we used to go over there with our neighbours, um, Eddins, Snackle Farms, Sluice Farm that would be.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:13.020"> The one just on the side of the road.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:15.600"> And, uh, yes, we&#039;d go over there for picnics and, uh, yeah, we used to have a, you know, now and again have a good time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:21.440"> Was it, was it, um, uh, was there a real sense of community there then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:30.540"> Uh, down the village, yeah, uh, you mean the village itself?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:34.740"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:35.160"> Oh yes, because those, those opposite the hall, those are all built, you see, um, because when I went down there first there was no houses there then, you know, so they&#039;d been built.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:44.920"> And, uh, at the back of the hall is a little cul-de-sac.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:48.900"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:49.340"> That&#039;s, the council houses that, further over, they were, they were there when I went down.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:54.100"> Um, and different houses being built around there, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:58.220"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:58.700"> Oh, it&#039;s nice of them, I&#039;ve been, I&#039;m quite upset really, because WI have been a member for 62 years down there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:05.580"> Have you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:06.160"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:06.920"> And, uh, I used to take my mother-in-law, because she didn&#039;t drive, Deirin&#039;s mother didn&#039;t drive.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:11.380"> So, when, then, after, uh, lunch, we&#039;d go down on the, the second Tuesday of the month, I used to pick her up and we&#039;d go down, because she was president at that time, and there was the back, the old black stoves, I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve seen the old, round black stoves.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:26.020"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:26.100"> We used to light that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:27.240"> In the village hall?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:28.300"> In the village hall.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:29.360"> And then put the chairs and tables up, and then go back then, and I&#039;d pick her up then, after tea then, to go to WI.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:36.520"> And, uh, yes, we did that for years.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:39.160"> Um, and then I used to have the milk van then, I had the milk van for a couple of, oh, for about a week or more in the afternoons, to go to, um, a place in Bremde to get a sanding machine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:50.600"> And, um, put in the back of the end, and then we&#039;d do the floor, you know, sand, get the floor all nice and, well, slimming up.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:57.300"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:57.640"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:58.000"> Oh, we&#039;ve had some good times round there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:59.920"> Really good times.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:00.420"> So, somebody was telling me that St. Brides WI used to have a canning machine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:05.780"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:06.440"> Do you know about that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:07.340"> Yes, yes, and Mother Prosser had it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:09.280"> Now, where it is, I don&#039;t know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:11.520"> Yes, because we used to put fruit into our own canning.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:14.540"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:15.600"> Hmm, hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:16.240"> I wonder where it is.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:17.760"> Now, I, I&#039;ve forgotten about that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:22.320"> I wonder where that is now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:25.980"> Yeah, now I wonder where that is.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:29.540"> You&#039;ve got me thinking that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:31.920"> I&#039;ll be trying to explore where it is.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:33.620"> So, would they, would the WI rent it out, or would they take it out to people and say, do the canning for people?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:41.220"> Uh, I could, I wouldn&#039;t, I can&#039;t say that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:43.920"> I mean, um, I know we used to borrow it and do our own.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:48.380"> At least Mother Prosser did more than I did, but I&#039;d give a hand, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:52.280"> But, um, that&#039;s interesting how you brought up that canning.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:55.720"> That&#039;s going to bother you now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:56.580"> I&#039;d be worried about that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:58.400"> It&#039;d be lovely if it&#039;s still around somewhere.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:00.660"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:02.740"> Yes, it would, wouldn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:04.060"> And it&#039;s still going, the St Brides WI?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:06.760"> St Brides?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:07.660"> No, no, it&#039;s folded up a long time ago.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:09.820"> Oh, really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:10.280"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:10.520"> Oh, that&#039;s a shame.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:11.540"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:12.080"> So, a lot of the people from there now come to Peterstone.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:15.700"> And this is why I&#039;m rather upset that Peterstone is talking about folding up.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:19.920"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:20.680"> Hmm, hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:21.700"> I mean, the secretary, she&#039;s moving away down to Swansea, well that&#039;s fair enough.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:26.060"> The president, she did say that she&#039;d do it for another two years.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:31.300"> Well, the two years has come up now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:32.940"> And no one else wants to take the responsibility.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:35.900"> That&#039;s such a shame.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:36.740"> It is a shame.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:37.540"> It is a shame.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:38.380"> And it&#039;s been going how long?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:39.680"> Well, I&#039;ve been down there 62 years.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:42.760"> That&#039;s phenomenal, Margaret.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:43.980"> And it was on a long time before that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:46.880"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:47.460"> Yeah, so sad really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:48.860"> How many members have you got down there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:50.780"> Yeah, we, we, there&#039;s, there&#039;s, um, from St Brides area, around Asda, where people live,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:58.820"> I expect there&#039;s 14 people come from that area.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:03.080"> And it, it seems such a shame that, um, you know, no one will take it on.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:08.060"> After all that time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:09.000"> Yeah, it is.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:10.060"> Because I was president for some years, about seven years, after Mother Pross had given it</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:15.340"> up, I don&#039;t know how long she was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:16.840"> But, um, no, it&#039;s quite sad.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:19.240"> I was quite, quite, um, upset about it really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:21.840"> But I&#039;m hoping, um, that I, I might join Kevin Mabley, Michael Stone when.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:28.000"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:28.160"> Which is nearer.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:29.520"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:29.980"> But, um, the distance didn&#039;t make any difference to me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:33.400"> I was talking about that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:33.880"> It&#039;s the longevity though, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:35.300"> Wins and weather.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:36.200"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:36.800"> Pick up a couple of ladies from Marsville on the way down, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:39.320"> Oh, how sweet.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:39.940"> Yeah, she was just enjoy it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:41.880"> That&#039;s how it goes, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:43.820"> So the, um, uh, so you, you said Mother Prosser used to can fruit.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:50.020"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:50.460"> Where did, where did her fruit come from?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:52.040"> Oh, well, um, she had, we had plum trees, you know, we had trees, we had plum trees and</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:57.520"> the, um, we had a couple of trees around here.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:00.760"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:01.200"> Plum trees and things and, well, I suppose that was our garden then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:05.240"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:05.780"> You know, and then we&#039;d have beans and stuff like that and, you know, to roast it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:10.380"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:10.500"> But, um, yeah, I&#039;ve forgotten about that canning machine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:14.600"> So what was the process then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:16.240"> So you&#039;d pick the fruit and then wash it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:18.760"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:19.060"> Was it easy?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:19.280"> And then put it, make a syrup.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:21.240"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:21.740"> And then put it in the tins.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:23.720"> And then with the machine you&#039;d seal it all.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:26.820"> And that would be a tin fruit.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:28.740"> Gosh, and that would last all the winter?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:30.800"> Well, yes, if, you know, you make as much as you can, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:34.300"> Or we could.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:35.900"> And, um, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:37.480"> Gosh, I&#039;m glad you thought about the canning machine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:40.360"> You&#039;ve got me worried now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:41.600"> Well, it&#039;s come up a few times, you see, so I thought, how curious.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:45.020"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:45.160"> I&#039;ve never heard of a canning machine before.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:47.000"> And that St Brides&#039; WI has a canning machine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:50.540"> It just sounds really resourceful to me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:53.080"> Yes, that&#039;s right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:54.700"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:56.280"> I wonder where that is now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:59.300"> Did the WI, because in the past the WI has been absolutely fantastic at recording local people and their memories.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:07.820"> Did the St Brides&#039; WI ever do anything like that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:11.600"> Ah, no, they folded up, as I said, and a couple of them came from there then, which are a few more now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:17.500"> Mm-hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:17.860"> Because the president that is now, uh, she lives in one of the houses by us does.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:22.460"> Mm-hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:22.700"> And of course a couple of her friends have come as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:25.000"> Mm-hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:25.440"> But, um, as I say, I was quite upset last week when I knew that it was going to fold up.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:29.880"> Oh, that is upsetting.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:30.760"> Yes, it is.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:31.860"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:32.240"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:32.600"> But there we are.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:33.740"> If people are not interested, you can&#039;t, um, can&#039;t force people to be.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:38.260"> You can&#039;t, unfortunately.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:39.120"> You can try and encourage.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:40.360"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:40.840"> But, um, yeah, so.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:42.820"> So as a young woman, a young wife, was it part of your, one&#039;s social life, the WI?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:49.200"> It was really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:50.320"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:50.900"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:51.620"> I went up to London for the two AGMs.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:55.120"> Excuse me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:55.380"> Just .</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:56.840"> WI was something that you did as a young wife and it&#039;s something you&#039;ve continued</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:02.320"> to do for a long time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:03.800"> Yes, yes, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:05.160"> I, um, yes, I enjoyed WI.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:07.740"> I went to London for the AGM on two occasions, which is at the, um, Albert Hall.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:13.660"> And that was very interesting where they come from all over the country there and, you</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:17.260"> know, that&#039;s, that&#039;s gone back a bit.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:20.580"> But, you know, being, it, so what struck me about, you know, down on the moors there, that</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:25.120"> it&#039;s quite a different landscape, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:27.400"> It&#039;s flat.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:28.280"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:28.560"> You&#039;ve got all the watercourses.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:29.580"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:30.260"> Was that a challenge in some way?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:32.840"> I don&#039;t know whether you&#039;ve found, um, of course there&#039;s people living in the church</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:36.820"> now, the church was, and on about, oh, what, what am I, five foot, am I, five foot</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:43.120"> or nothing?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:43.800"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:44.240"> Uh, it&#039;s up about, um, well I should know, was it, where the Great Flood was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:49.900"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:50.620"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:51.300"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:51.620"> And, um, the bank, you can see the bank, now in one of the fields of one of the farms</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:56.720"> up as you go down the road a bit.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:58.700"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:59.180"> Um, yes, uh, well, I think I&#039;m right in saying that the water molars came up and they lived</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:05.680"> to Castleton.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:06.460"> Yeah, it was, yeah, because it goes down, doesn&#039;t it, apparently?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:09.380"> Mm-hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:09.520"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:10.000"> It&#039;s very low, very low.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:11.500"> Did you ever experience flooding there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:13.840"> No, no, the rens would fill up quite a way, you know, but no, no, we never had any flooding</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:19.380"> as such, no.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:21.100"> What was it like having young children around those things, though, was it ever a worry?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:26.020"> Um, oh yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:27.300"> Yes, now the neighbours further, on the next farm down to, um, was the farm then, um,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:32.640"> they lost a child that drowned in the, in the, um, water.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:37.020"> Oh, oh really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:40.400"> Yes, yes, yes, mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:44.860"> But, um, I suppose you get, you know, I suppose if you&#039;re, if you&#039;re born down there, you&#039;ll</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:49.480"> get used to it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:50.580"> I know the one that&#039;s came down, the one down, further on down the road, uh, was from London,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:56.180"> came down to see the sister, um, came down and brought the little one, of course, went</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:01.080"> down the steps and down in the reen there, you know, which is very sad, very sad.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:05.460"> Oh gosh, that&#039;s so sad, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:06.480"> Terrible, terrible, terrible.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:08.580"> Yes, but, um.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:10.720"> When you first went to Sluis Farm, was there electricity and stuff?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:15.600"> Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:18.100"> Because when I lived in Langoes, we had no electric.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:20.140"> No, no.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:20.840"> I got the Aladdin lamp there, the hanging Aladdin lamp.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:23.400"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:24.080"> And, um, I&#039;ve got lots of table lamp that&#039;s in there, that&#039;s with oil, and, uh, we didn&#039;t</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:29.560"> have any out-to-water or cold water or anything like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:32.100"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:32.800"> Because you talked about the winter of 47, what was the winter of 62, 63 like?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:37.840"> Uh, I was down here then, of course.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:40.380"> Oh, here?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:40.900"> Yes, yes, it was bad then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:42.660"> Oh, right, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:42.740"> Um, I used to go up to Castleton with the tractor, uh, to, um, have the lorry to come</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:49.160"> down, you know, to bring it down.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:51.160"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:51.360"> And then, um, in the evenings then, um, a couple of the locals there, the youngsters,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:56.800"> he&#039;d, um, they&#039;d taken down the six bells on a, on a, on a big board, drag it down the,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:03.240"> down the road, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:04.460"> Oh, yes, we had quite a lot of snow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:06.560"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:07.980"> But we had more when we Langoes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:09.600"> I can remember seeing on Penavan.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:12.360"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:13.060"> Uh, down one of the crevices in June.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:15.560"> There was still snow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:16.940"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:17.380"> Mm, my goodness.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:17.940"> I can see that now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:19.300"> Went on and on and on, didn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:20.680"> Yeah, it did, it did.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:21.880"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:21.980"> Did anyone ever go skating on Marines or anything like that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:24.920"> Uh, on the, on the lake.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:26.280"> On the lake.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:26.740"> Oh, on the, on the, oh sorry, Langoes Lake they used to go, but I mean, well, it was frozen</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:31.300"> over and a motorbike went across and I was never known before.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:34.960"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:35.360"> It went across the other side.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:36.720"> I&#039;ve never heard that before.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:38.060"> Mm, mm, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:38.960"> Brave man.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:39.440"> They reckon they did.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:40.260"> But, uh, yes, I should say, but many did freeze, didn&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:43.460"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:44.160"> You know, it&#039;s just, and, um, yeah, we used to go to the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:47.380"> Langoes, we used to go, we used to go, and, uh, a crowd of us from where we lived in Langoes,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:51.380"> we used to take one of these little boats.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:53.480"> Uh, we used to go down to, and the other side of Langoes is Langasty.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:58.040"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:58.500"> And, I don&#039;t know where, you&#039;ve been to Langoes, would you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:00.840"> Mm, mm, mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:01.020"> And if you look across there, there&#039;s a little hall,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:03.360"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:03.720"> About three fields from the end of the river, I said, and, uh, Langoessey Hall,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:08.000"> and we used to go across there to dances, and we&#039;d take one of these, uh, skiff, uh, boats,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:13.300"> you know, and we&#039;d row across there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:15.620"> Did you really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:17.080"> And, um...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:17.260"> That&#039;s quite some distance.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:18.780"> Yeah, it was, really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:20.100"> But when you&#039;re young, you don&#039;t notice distance, do you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:22.140"> I wouldn&#039;t do it now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:23.000"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:23.920"> And we used to tether it there, and walk up these two fields, go to the dance,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:28.200"> come back, then, and roll back.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:29.940"> My goodness.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:31.220"> Imagine if my daughter was doing that, I&#039;d be, you know,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:33.800"> Yeah, or what we used to do.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:34.380"> It&#039;s good our parents don&#039;t know what we&#039;re doing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:36.360"> Yeah, yeah, what we used to do then, years ago, when we were young.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:39.180"> Do you remember the, um, uh, did you ever help with haymaking as a young farmer&#039;s wife?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:46.420"> Uh, well, yes, dry the tractor, perhaps, and that, you know, the baling.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:50.040"> Oh, right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:50.240"> And, of course, um, we had, um, I don&#039;t know, a photograph, I don&#039;t know what I got,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:55.040"> I might have got a photograph here, where, um, we just came up, excuse me, I don&#039;t know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:34:59.820"> Oh, what&#039;s this price here, then, Margaret?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:01.940"> Well, this is when I was, I was, uh, First Lady Chairman of, um, of, um, St. Mellon&#039;s Show.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:08.060"> Now, you, that was a big show, someone said to me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:11.020"> Oh, yes, oh, it was lovely, oh, yes, oh, fair play, it was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:14.440"> And I was looking forward to St. Mellon&#039;s Show.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:17.840"> So, is it a very strong farming community?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:20.700"> Is it a very close-knit farming community to go there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:23.920"> Um, yes, I think, yeah, I think so, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:26.580"> You know, we do a lot of things together.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:27.960"> We had two donkeys, and, um, uh, this donkey down Sluths, and then we put her in foal,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:36.060"> and, oh, you&#039;ve never seen such a sweet thing when this little one came.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:40.660"> I think the whole village came down to see it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:42.860"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:43.260"> Oh, just the, the deal thing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:44.600"> Someone told me that farmers kept donkeys because they were good luck.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:49.020"> Well, yes, they, they, they, um, they do, a lot of people have had donkeys with cattle.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:54.840"> Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:56.040"> But I&#039;ve never heard that before.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:57.440"> Yes, yes, I don&#039;t know whether it&#039;s, oh, there&#039;s the, uh, I spent a little, little one.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:02.840"> Wow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:03.520"> This is 1955.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:05.240"> I sold my sheep and I bought the little sports car.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:09.280"> Is that you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:10.140"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:10.760"> No, that&#039;s not me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:11.580"> My, that&#039;s my mother and my aunt, but that&#039;s the little car I bought.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:14.600"> You bought it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:15.420"> Yeah, I sold the sheep and I bought the little car.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:17.920"> Oh, I think that&#039;s so impressive.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:20.040"> That must have been very unusual for a young woman then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:23.440"> Oh, yeah, we used to have some fun.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:24.660"> We used to go, um, following the hounds.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:27.640"> Did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:28.000"> Yeah, on the top there, and, um, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:29.860"> And then one day, um, walking back to the middle of the car, and here comes the local policeman</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:35.660"> with a steering wheel in his hand.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:37.840"> He did the steering wheel off.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:39.780"> Why?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:40.340"> I went to Blackpool and that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:42.080"> And back.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:43.200"> Oh, my goodness.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:44.280"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:44.580"> Me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:44.860"> What sort of car is it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:46.060"> It was a, uh, built up, um, Le Mans, the singer.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:50.360"> It had a singer engine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:51.940"> I am so impressed with you.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:54.420"> Oh, my goodness.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:55.820"> And then, so you would follow the hounds down on the malls?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:58.480"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:59.060"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:59.860"> Eric was telling me about that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:01.200"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:01.940"> The Shredega Hunt.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:03.260"> Oh, so where would you go?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:04.960"> And the Shredega Hunt was, um, based then in, um, Baisley.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:09.500"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:10.060"> But they&#039;ve, um, it&#039;s all been built on now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:12.260"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:12.880"> So they&#039;ve gone up to Gettley Gare.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:14.860"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:15.360"> The hounds up there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:16.580"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:17.020"> So, um, I mean, we use them if we have dead stock or something.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:21.520"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:21.820"> We pay so much a year.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:22.800"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:23.120"> For them to pick it up, to take it up to the, uh, Austin, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:25.900"> But then you would follow them in your car?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:27.860"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:28.040"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:28.800"> And who would you do that with?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:30.180"> And that&#039;s on top of Penaline.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:31.700"> I didn&#039;t throw a Penaline.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:32.780"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:33.300"> That&#039;s like an orchard there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:36.420"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:37.220"> We used our trees.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:38.760"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:38.840"> So did you get apples off those as well?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:41.760"> Yes, apples and pears.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:43.080"> Did you, did you ever make cider from them?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:45.400"> No, no, but we used to can them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:47.560"> Can them?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:48.180"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:48.700"> Gosh, that&#039;s that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:49.400"> So where was the orchard then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:51.160"> And this, this, this, this was my...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:52.140"> So where was the orchard here?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:54.320"> There.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:55.120"> Oh, gosh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:56.580"> Okay.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:57.520"> And this was my garden out by here.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:01.320"> Ah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:02.240"> Did you ever have horses on your farm?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:04.960"> Um, no.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:05.880"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:06.400"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:06.800"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:06.980"> Not just the two donkeys.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:08.240"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:08.320"> Oh, he did.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:08.960"> Oh, gosh, that&#039;s me when I was, oh, I shouldn&#039;t be showing you this.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:12.240"> It&#039;s 1951.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:13.100"> Oh, please do.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:13.820"> I represented, uh, Lango, Miss Lango, Lango in Breconshire.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:19.280"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:20.220"> So when it was haymaking, would you have had to make all the lunches for everyone coming</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:24.500"> in who was helping with the haymaking?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:25.580"> Yeah, usually in the evening I&#039;d cook, uh, cook ham potatoes and stuff like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:30.600"> They&#039;d come in at supper time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:31.880"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:32.340"> And not so much in the daytime.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:33.940"> I mean, they&#039;d have some in to eat sandwiches or something.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:35.980"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:36.320"> But, uh, I used to cook them in the evening, you know, for them to come in.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:39.420"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:39.780"> Yeah, and they&#039;d come back.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:40.600"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:41.100"> Yeah, we had a lovely life, really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:44.060"> And that was me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:45.280"> So did you ever, you were probably then too young to have ever thatched hay ricks then</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:50.200"> and stuff.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:51.460"> Uh, oh, well, yeah, I&#039;ve seen them then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:54.740"> Have you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:55.280"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:55.840"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:55.940"> When I was at my grandparents, they used to do it there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:59.380"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:59.960"> Uh, but of course we&#039;ve always had the bans and because of the bales now, but we used to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:03.540"> do small bales.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:05.240"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:05.780"> Um, I think there&#039;s a certain amount of small bales now, if I remember rightly.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:10.320"> Um, because it&#039;s the round ones now, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:12.720"> Yes, of course.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:13.660"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:14.200"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:16.180"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:16.620"> So times have altered.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:18.320"> So was there any, there&#039;s something I&#039;ve been meaning to ask, and I&#039;ve forgotten to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:21.440"> ask everybody else, but was there, excuse me, any, any food or, um, meals?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:29.960"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:30.240"> So for example, my parents are Irish and it&#039;s a traditional field meal we would be have</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:37.040"> would be boiled ham, parsley sauce and something called chump, which was potatoes and onions</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:43.240"> and cabbage.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:44.500"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:44.780"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:44.840"> Is there anything on the morse that was traditional like that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:48.020"> Any particular dishes or?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:49.580"> I used to always boil ham.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:50.800"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:51.800"> You know, I like boiled ham, it&#039;s nice and potatoes and stuff like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:56.060"> Um, no, I suppose, do it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:59.060"> I think it&#039;s, I think it&#039;s a thing that&#039;s, um, a farmhouse, uh, meal isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:05.900"> Boiled ham, potatoes, peas, parsley sauce.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:10.260"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:10.820"> You know, that type of thing isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:12.320"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:12.520"> So you would always be in the kitchen providing food for people working on the farm?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:17.060"> Yes, yes, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:18.480"> Oh yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:19.620"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:20.500"> And, um, yes, I used to, um, go out and feed the chicken and things, I used to feed the poultry,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:26.380"> you know, feed the poultry and all that, but, um, yes, and they&#039;d come in then about two</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:31.800"> o&#039;clock, ten o&#039;clock and then they&#039;d sit down and it&#039;s a supper and then they&#039;d go about</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:35.800"> twelve o&#039;clock, one o&#039;clock.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:37.440"> Wow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:38.600"> Wow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:38.960"> Yeah, yeah, well I just enjoy the hay making, you know, the harvest time was to be lovely.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:43.480"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:43.780"> Well, why was, what was it, why did you like it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:46.020"> Because it was just a...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:46.580"> Well, um, I think, well, meeting, they used to come in and, you know, and then, you know,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:52.320"> we&#039;d, um, go hauling the bales and all this business, you know, the loose hay years ago.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:57.040"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:57.500"> I thought I had a photograph here of, um, I haven&#039;t caught one, but I had a photograph here</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:03.280"> of the, um, oh, what was it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:05.840"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:05.980"> So do you, do you remember any of the people who used to work for the drainage ball that</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:10.040"> used to come round and clear the reens and stuff?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:13.980"> Um, oh dear, what was his name? Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:17.660"> Um, I can see him now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:20.460"> Oh, really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:22.400"> Oh, oh, they look into me in a moment.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:27.380"> Yes, he&#039;s just slashed it over the long-handed hook.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:30.900"> Oh, do you remember that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:31.860"> Down the Broadway.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:32.500"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:32.960"> Down the Broadway particularly.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:33.880"> Um, oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:41.460"> Well, the one has died now, back a couple of months ago.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:45.080"> Um.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:47.400"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:49.440"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:50.560"> I can&#039;t think of the other gentleman.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:52.140"> I can see him, I can see him now doing this, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:55.960"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:56.100"> Well, that&#039;s silly, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:56.860"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:57.560"> I&#039;ll come to you.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:58.800"> You&#039;ll come.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:59.560"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:59.760"> And so, and so Dilwin was on the drainage board?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:02.540"> Yeah, Dilwin was on the drainage board and his father was before him.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:05.540"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:05.900"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:06.020"> So what did that mean?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:07.320"> Did it mean just, you know, was it an important role?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:12.060"> Um, well, I suppose it controlled the reens and everything really, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:16.520"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:16.580"> The drainage board more or less, you know, to, um, see that they were cut and the reed, the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:21.500"> reeds were cut and everything from, off the sides, and, I suppose, controlled the, um,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:28.480"> the gates.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:29.320"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:29.580"> They&#039;d open out opposite, at the bottom of, um, the Broadway.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:33.140"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:33.760"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:33.980"> The gates are automatic, it&#039;s all automatic now, you see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:37.100"> Years ago, it used to have to be done more or less by, by hands.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:40.640"> You know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:41.400"> So, it&#039;s, it&#039;s, the mows are very interested, really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:45.720"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:46.440"> Very interesting, aren&#039;t they, in different things?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:48.840"> I think so.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:49.420"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:49.600"> I think it&#039;s fascinating, actually.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:51.320"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:51.340"> It&#039;s so different.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:52.200"> Um, what about fish?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:53.460"> Did you ever get eels in the reen or...?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:57.100"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:57.920"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:58.200"> Down the bottom, down the bottom of the dry, out, sluice, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:01.160"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:01.500"> You used to have eels out of there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:03.020"> Did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:03.520"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:04.080"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:04.720"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:05.220"> What, used to cut them?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:06.300"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:07.040"> I used to live an eel.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:08.200"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:08.860"> So how did you catch them and cut them?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:10.680"> Oh, you&#039;d catch them, you know, you&#039;d catch them with a, a, a, a, a, a rod.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:16.000"> A rod.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:16.920"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:17.040"> And put something on the end of it, you know, and catch them like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:19.860"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:19.900"> And you&#039;d put them in the bucket then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:21.140"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:21.680"> So as, um, you know, they&#039;d have fresh water, and then you&#039;d, um, you&#039;d kill them and, um,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:26.640"> eat them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:27.260"> How long would you keep them?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:28.400"> I wouldn&#039;t.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:28.740"> He wouldn&#039;t.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:29.700"> Oh, no.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:30.680"> You&#039;d keep them in the fresh bucket for a few days, fresh of water.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:33.620"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:33.900"> Change the water for a day until as soon as I get the, um, well, the earthy stuff.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:39.320"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:39.640"> Otherwise you&#039;d be eating earth.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:41.500"> So you would do that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:42.640"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:43.300"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:44.040"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:44.420"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:44.620"> And then you would skin it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:46.020"> Skin it and then cook it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:47.800"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:47.900"> Just fry it in the frying pan, chop it up in bits.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:50.160"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:50.860"> But there were very keen.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:52.660"> I mean, I, I enjoy anything.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:54.380"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:54.700"> Or everything, put it that way.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:56.800"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:57.480"> I&#039;m not fed even with my food.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:58.680"> I enjoy a lot.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:59.320"> That&#039;s a good free source of food, though.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:01.540"> Yeah, it is, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:02.880"> What about Elvis?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:04.160"> Was that something anyone ever had down there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:06.300"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:06.940"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:07.200"> I don&#039;t think so.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:08.320"> No, no.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:09.860"> Down the bottom end of the, the, the, um, drive of Boston, they&#039;d be, uh, you have them</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:16.020"> down there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:16.780"> I&#039;d have to get them up, up through the, um, you know, up the fields, you&#039;d get them in</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:21.300"> the, the Boston&#039;s.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:22.740"> Did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:23.040"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:23.980"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:25.840"> Crikey.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:26.880"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:27.440"> It&#039;s, um, it&#039;s fascinating really, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:30.240"> When you think back what you&#039;ve seen and done.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:32.560"> What about church?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:33.740"> Did your family ever go to church?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:35.080"> You know, when you were down living on.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:37.160"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:37.440"> I used to go to St. Peter&#039;s Church, which is the big church in the village.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:40.540"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:41.060"> But of course that closed.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:42.320"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:42.740"> And, um, it&#039;s a house now, prison.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:45.900"> Is that something the whole family would go to?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:48.800"> Uh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:49.680"> Sunday morning we used to try and go to church on a Sunday evening.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:52.480"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:53.040"> I mean, Father Prosser was a church warden there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:55.240"> Was he?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:55.720"> There was father.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:56.660"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:57.040"> Oh, yes, he was a big churchman.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:58.580"> Was he?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:59.180"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:00.120"> And Mother Prosser used to go.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:02.200"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:02.920"> And do it occasionally.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:04.120"> And, um, they were married, they were married in Peter&#039;s Stone Church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:08.600"> But of course it closed then, a little while after.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:13.020"> And, um, it&#039;s a house now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:15.740"> People&#039;s got it as a house.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:16.880"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:16.920"> They were living in there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:18.480"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:19.280"> Unfortunately, the gentleman died now only last year.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:23.260"> Um, his wife and the child are still there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:25.720"> But, um, apparently they were, I&#039;ve never been in there since, naturally.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:29.940"> But they were living in pods.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:32.500"> Were they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:33.200"> It&#039;s a big churchman.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:34.640"> It&#039;s huge, high.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:35.720"> Crikey.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:36.840"> Oh, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:37.580"> Tremendous height.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:38.320"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:39.080"> Been at the top of the tower.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:40.640"> Lovely view from there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:41.640"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:42.300"> Mm-hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:43.600"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:43.800"> And then...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:44.520"> Would the congregation have been very big?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:46.700"> Um, well, yes, it varied then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:51.220"> You know, it&#039;s like, Marshfield is a bigger church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:53.680"> Or they do get more, um, congregation there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:58.200"> Because I suppose it&#039;s in a bigger village, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:00.580"> And that&#039;s a nice church too, St Mary&#039;s Church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:03.440"> I&#039;ve got, um, doings, I&#039;ve got a rose tree down there for doing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:06.900"> But I&#039;ve also got a casket up in the field up here.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:09.740"> Have you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:10.260"> Of his, um, ashes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:11.740"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:13.920"> And, um...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:14.800"> Do you remember any characters that stand out for you that you remember?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:19.240"> Well, um, before the buildings that are, oh, they&#039;re on the other side of the road now,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:22.980"> there were buildings, but not like they are now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:26.280"> And there used to be an old fellow living in there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:28.520"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:29.020"> And, um, Dennis, his name was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:31.920"> And, uh, he used to wear a long, long coat.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:35.240"> Uh, he lived in there and there was a grate in the corner where you&#039;d have a bit of a fireplace if you wanted it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:42.020"> And Dennis, and he&#039;d walk from there then into town, or Rumney.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:46.000"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:46.240"> And walk back.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:46.960"> I can see him now, it was in this ages ago.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:49.020"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:49.200"> But he had this long, long black coat.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:50.920"> And then there was another one down at, um, uh, the farm down at, um, St. Brides.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:58.560"> And his name was, um, what, he was another character.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:04.040"> They, um, oh, I can&#039;t, I can&#039;t think of his name.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:09.340"> He lived in a, in a barn.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:11.900"> Well, they&#039;re kind of like, I don&#039;t like to use the word tramp, but kind of like a, just somebody who used to...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:16.580"> Well, they were, yes, they were kind of a tramp type of person, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:21.300"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:21.400"> Uh, Billy Mitch, that was down there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:23.840"> That&#039;s right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:24.520"> And Dennis used to be in this one, that, um, in our, in our barn over there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:28.820"> They were no trouble.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:29.960"> I mean, you know, they, um, actually, I think Father Prosser, uh, went over there one day and, and he, he died in the, Boston, and so.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:38.960"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:39.220"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:39.440"> Where to get the police and all that was, whatever.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:41.520"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:41.740"> Awesome, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:42.840"> But, um, no, they were characters about then, weren&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:46.200"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:46.500"> Years ago, like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:47.880"> They&#039;d, um, uh, well, I can see them, I can place them now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:54.060"> And it&#039;s going back a little while.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:56.000"> Yes, Dennis and, um, Billy Mitch used to call them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:59.280"> And he&#039;d always, um, and if, they&#039;d reckon as if the aeroplanes were coming over during the war,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:04.020"> because that was when he was there, down the war, um, he turned his pipe upside down in case he&#039;s,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:11.960"> Oh, isn&#039;t that lovely?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:13.680"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:14.160"> Isn&#039;t that lovely?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:14.980"> It was coming from my, when he was thinking of another thing, because they might see his pipe.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:18.400"> Oh, right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:20.880"> Oh, it was really funny.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:23.100"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:23.700"> Someone was telling me, now, where was it now?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:28.500"> I can&#039;t remember.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:30.640"> But, oh, something about that, was it St. Brides, or was it somewhere else there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:36.480"> I might be wrong, that on the Sunday the pubs used to be closed in Wales.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:41.300"> This is when the border was different, so people used to flood over to here to use the pubs on the Sunday.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:46.960"> Is that right?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:48.080"> Maybe I&#039;ve got that wrong.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:49.540"> Um, no, they used to, I, um, there was a law, wasn&#039;t there, where the pubs used to close on a Sunday, a lot of places.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:57.780"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:59.200"> But I can&#039;t, I can&#039;t remember where that, um, you know, it was, um, wasn&#039;t with ours.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:05.560"> I might go that wrong, actually.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:07.220"> I mean, it&#039;s, I feel very sad, really, the six bells is closed.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:11.200"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:11.980"> You know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:12.360"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:12.760"> I mean, and that&#039;s, that was, there was two cottages at the side of that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:16.840"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:17.720"> And, um.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:19.420"> Was it a popular pub?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:21.060"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:22.340"> Oh, we&#039;ve had a lot of lovely times down there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:24.660"> Have you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:24.960"> Especially Christmas time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:26.260"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:26.760"> You know, we&#039;d go down there and somebody would be playing the organ and we&#039;d have a good old sing song and that, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:32.140"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:32.320"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:32.820"> And, um, oh, I think I got a photograph.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:36.420"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:36.640"> I&#039;m boring you with these photographs.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:37.880"> You are not.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:38.540"> I love photographs, Margaret.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:40.340"> I really do love photographs.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:41.900"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:42.260"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:43.520"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:45.820"> This is the six bells with all the holeses.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:50.320"> Oh, no, that&#039;s interesting.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:51.700"> I think I might have seen that photograph before.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:54.420"> Have you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:54.760"> Maybe.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:56.240"> Um, no, I think.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:59.060"> He was no master.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:01.860"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:02.620"> So what hunt, which pack is this?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:04.620"> This would be the, um, uh, what&#039;s it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:08.640"> Oh, Tredega.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:10.320"> Tredega.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:10.760"> Tredega.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:10.860"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:11.000"> To do the hunt, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:12.040"> And this is the one you used to follow in your sports car.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:14.400"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:15.420"> Yes, that&#039;s right, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:17.740"> Oh, and who&#039;s this?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:18.620"> Another one.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:19.200"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:20.620"> And do you know where this is taken?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:22.580"> No, I&#039;m not certain of that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:25.180"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:25.360"> And, see, there was two cottages at the side of the six bells.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:28.700"> Oh, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:29.540"> And then this is, um, what was this, uh, Cairn-Philp.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:34.200"> Uh, only, only now, late, last year.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:37.240"> Because it looks like it&#039;s been closed for years, doesn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:39.520"> Yes, it does, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:40.420"> It looks like a mess, doesn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:41.600"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:42.600"> Yes, it&#039;s a shame because we had a lot of fun down there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:45.040"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:45.340"> Hmm, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:46.140"> I just meant, look, thinking about the St. Melon&#039;s show.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:49.540"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:49.800"> I mean, does that...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:50.580"> That&#039;s folded now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:51.260"> That&#039;s folded.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:51.940"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:52.140"> But I understand that was a huge event in its time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:54.340"> Yes, yes, it was very good.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:55.740"> We had, we had tremendous, uh, times with the show.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:59.000"> We used to be on the, um, first of all, St. Melon&#039;s show was, it used to be at, uh, Rimley,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:05.140"> the, um, the, uh, Rimley Hill.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:07.540"> And then it came then to, um, oh, what&#039;s there now?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:12.600"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:14.580"> Down the bottom of the Cairn-A, Bakers used to have the farm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:19.880"> Uh, oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:22.780"> Well, all these, oh, oh dear, I can&#039;t think of the name.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:28.860"> Oh, that&#039;s silly, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:30.180"> You know, when you go down now towards Newport.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:32.180"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:32.620"> All these buildings on the right hand side and this left hand side.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:35.860"> Like a radiator plant and stuff.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:37.080"> That&#039;s right, that&#039;s right, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:38.660"> Stuff really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:39.140"> We used to have the show there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:40.740"> Did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:40.840"> And then we came then to Cairn-Mabley here down the bottom of this lane.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:44.080"> Where you came over the bridge by the farm park.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:46.640"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:47.000"> We used to have it there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:48.180"> Oh, really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:48.820"> Yes, in the big field there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:49.940"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:50.580"> And, um, uh, oh yes, and then we went then to Tudeka House.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:55.280"> Oh, really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:55.340"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:55.760"> But it was never the same.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:57.360"> Not really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:58.520"> You know, we used to get, um, I don&#039;t know why it was, because it was a nice site.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:03.000"> But, um, we didn&#039;t get the agricultural side of things.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:06.620"> Yeah, it changed.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:07.700"> It changed altogether.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:09.180"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:09.540"> So where it was used to be by Khoi Kurnu.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:12.420"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:12.780"> What was it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:13.520"> So where that area is now, it&#039;s completely developed, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:16.640"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:17.300"> Was it just farmland then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:18.760"> It was farmland, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:19.940"> It&#039;s hard to imagine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:21.660"> It is, it is, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:22.760"> Before the motorway and everything, it was...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:26.540"> Yes, well of course they&#039;re talking about putting another road up onto the motorway.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:31.880"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:32.560"> I don&#039;t know where that&#039;s going to happen, I don&#039;t know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:34.220"> But it was just farmland.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:35.620"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:36.580"> It&#039;s...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:36.980"> It was just a little there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:38.280"> And it was where all the local farmers would go along there, would they, to present,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:43.260"> show their livestock?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:45.160"> Yes, oh yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:45.700"> It was a proper agriculture show.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:47.200"> Oh yes, it was, definitely.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:48.200"> Everything was there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:49.540"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:49.920"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:50.780"> And the local show now is Macken show.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:54.160"> Okay.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:54.720"> And that&#039;s always on the first Saturday of July.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:56.960"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:57.280"> And that&#039;s a nice little show.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:58.480"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:59.000"> And that&#039;s the biggest what St. Mellins was, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:01.600"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:01.740"> But, oh yes, oh yes, we&#039;ve had a lot of fun at the shows.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:05.960"> Yeah, lovely.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:07.260"> But there they are, things altered aren&#039;t they over the years?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:09.840"> Yeah, they do.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:10.720"> You know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:11.420"> I was just going to ask you about the lighthouse pub.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:14.120"> Is that something that locals would have ever used?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:17.700"> Was it, was that something people from out of town would use?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:20.820"> Uh, have you been down to the lighthouse pub?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:23.600"> Oh, it was very pleasant.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:24.680"> And a lot of people used to walk on the bank, you know, across the bank.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:28.000"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:28.620"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:29.200"> What, would people walk along from the, Cardiff along here?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:32.620"> Yes, well yes, sort of from Remedy perhaps, you know, walk and then you&#039;d see them go back</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:37.480"> and that, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:38.560"> Yes, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:39.600"> Oh, it&#039;s very pleasant on there, it&#039;s a nice day.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:42.100"> Yeah, it is, it&#039;s nice.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:42.900"> You know, it&#039;s, you go up and you can see both sides.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:46.300"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:47.420"> I&#039;m sure he was telling me that, um, that people used to, um, stay in almost like a chalet,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:55.060"> seat shack in, in, on the, by the seawall.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:00.020"> Is that right?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:00.480"> At St. Bride?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:01.340"> At St. Bride?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:02.340"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:02.360"> Or was it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:03.260"> They&#039;ve got caravans there now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:05.100"> I don&#039;t think he meant the caravan, that people would rent out, would come out for the weekend</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:09.980"> and, maybe he did mean the caravan actually.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:12.800"> I didn&#039;t think he did mean that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:14.840"> Maybe I got that wrong.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:16.340"> But you said people would come out for the day on their bikes and...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:20.160"> Oh, a lot of people should recite Lotus and Brides.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:22.680"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:23.260"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:23.980"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:24.960"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:25.840"> And of course they&#039;d have these little tent things, wouldn&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:29.160"> Oh really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:29.900"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:30.960"> You see those down there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:32.400"> What, like people would camp?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:33.500"> Yes, yes, they&#039;d sleep in there and then, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:36.140"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:36.720"> Mm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:36.980"> But, what, along by the wall or?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:39.200"> Um, not so much at all, but before they put the caravan sites, because they&#039;re a fair</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:44.360"> big caravan site at St. Bride, apparently, which I haven&#039;t been there for years.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:48.460"> Excuse me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:49.640"> And, um, they used to have these little tent things, you know, you see it on the television,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:54.900"> don&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:55.580"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:56.220"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:57.140"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:57.860"> Oh, I didn&#039;t know that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:58.800"> Yes, it&#039;s, uh, yeah, times have changed, haven&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:02.740"> Yeah, they have, they have.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:04.520"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:05.080"> There&#039;s one thing I have to ask you about, because I was asking about it, because part of what</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:08.440"> I&#039;m doing is, um, talking to people who live along the moors, but, um, that includes</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:14.500"> people from the gypsy community.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:16.600"> Mm-hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:16.980"> Um, do you remember any gypsies coming through and...?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:21.780"> Well, when we had ground in, um, we rented ground on the corner down in Simbra, I think,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:27.060"> um, um, uh, where the gypsy caravan site is now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:34.840"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:34.860"> Mm-hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:35.160"> Uh, there was to be the old, she was an old gypsy in the proper old, uh,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:41.220"> Rhyme top.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:42.000"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:42.320"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:42.820"> And they were there for years on the corner of our field, and we used to have to just</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:46.860"> pass them, you know, to go into the field.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:49.240"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:49.420"> And they&#039;d give no trouble at all.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:50.800"> But these are not gypsies, are they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:52.900"> Mm-hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:53.180"> They&#039;ve been unkind, they&#039;re travellers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:54.960"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:55.840"> You know?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:56.240"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:56.760"> And, I mean, they&#039;ve got horses tethered, and, oh, but a friend of mine, she saw this</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:02.800"> little tiny pony window, and she thought the pole thing, and I was like, it&#039;s wheat.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:07.060"> She came home and took some hay down to give it to her on the road.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:10.080"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:10.680"> You know?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:11.280"> It&#039;s sad.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:12.300"> No, these are travellers more, I think, you know, it&#039;s, they&#039;re not the proper gypsy.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:16.040"> Mm-hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:16.940"> I don&#039;t think.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:18.760"> There we are, that&#039;s life I suppose, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:21.160"> It is, I suppose.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:22.560"> And there&#039;s so many of them now, isn&#039;t there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:24.500"> So do you know, you go towards Cardiff and Rumley from where it lives now?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:29.240"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:29.380"> I mean, again, when you first arrived, was that just agricultural land?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:34.600"> Oh yes, or just fields.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:37.100"> It&#039;s hard for me to imagine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:38.900"> Yes, yes, and yes, and of course there&#039;s the, or KLG, which is a bit firm opposite, isn&#039;t</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:46.280"> it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:46.700"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:47.720"> And motor things, but, oh yes, it was all, it&#039;s most unfortunate.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:53.580"> I mean, there&#039;s a little house there as you go down towards the caravan site, on the right-hand</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:59.600"> side, he was the coalman, it was a saddler.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:03.020"> And I look at it now and I think to myself, oh, if he came back and saw us, yeah, he&#039;d</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:09.120"> be very, very upset about it, you know, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:12.020"> He was the coalman?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:13.420"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:14.100"> So he delivered coal?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:14.940"> He delivered coal, yes, yeah, the bags of coal.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:17.620"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:19.260"> Mr. Sadler, his son is still alive, and he lives in Rumley.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:24.420"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:24.780"> I&#039;ve seen him for some time actually, but as the house was, it was immaculate, you know,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:29.400"> but as it is now, the slates are gone and, oh, it&#039;s a mess.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:35.360"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:35.400"> He&#039;d break his heart.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:36.440"> Do you remember a nurse, I&#039;m sure it was Nurse Cox, she was the midwife?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:41.000"> Oh yes, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:43.140"> Now, she lived on the top of Pennerland, didn&#039;t she?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:46.820"> That&#039;s right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:47.920"> Well, there were two cottages there, and I&#039;m very friendly with Betty Stevens, her name is</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:54.000"> now, she was Betty Bridge.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:55.760"> She lived in there, one of those, and her brother, and those, well of course they were</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:02.240"> gone, was that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:03.560"> Yes, Nurse Cox.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:04.800"> And there was another nurse who lived up there too, because Nurse Cox moved down to Castleton.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:09.720"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:10.460"> On the left hand side, as you go down off the main road.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:14.720"> Oh yes, she used to go around delivering the babies.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:17.180"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:18.460"> Did she deliver Andrew and your daughter?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:20.960"> No, I went into Glossop.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:22.920"> Oh, did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:23.520"> Yes, yes, I went to Glossop, Taz.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:25.640"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:26.000"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:26.620"> I just stayed in with both of them actually.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:29.980"> But, yes, you&#039;re bringing back memories for me as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:34.000"> Oh, well I met her...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:37.120"> Well, I suppose we&#039;ve got hedgerows here, whereas down there there&#039;s the reens.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:41.120"> Ah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:41.880"> You know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:42.400"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:43.500"> But not really, I suppose, no.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:46.060"> No, the grass is green.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:47.900"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:49.280"> And you drove a tractor from early on?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:51.620"> Oh yes, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:53.660"> I drove, when we moved from Langoes down to Betty Hill, on a Ferguson, Ferguson 25, excuse</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:02.560"> me, I did three journeys from Langoes down to Betty Hill, and it took me four and a half</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:07.400"> hours.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:08.440"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:08.860"> With the trailer behind, with implements and stuff, brought them down to Betty Hill Farm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:14.660"> And then when I was going back, do you know the way, do you know Pontypool area, which,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:20.000"> you know...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:21.140"> I&#039;ve been to Pontymoyle recently.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:23.240"> Pontymoyle?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:23.680"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:24.260"> Alright, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:25.020"> Well, when you go, it wasn&#039;t the new road then, because we wouldn&#039;t have been able to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:28.880"> go on the new road anyway.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:30.280"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:30.560"> We wouldn&#039;t be able to go on the motorway, you know, with a tractor, the same then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:36.140"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:36.540"> And I used to go down past the Holston Jockey on the bottom, and I used to go down the hill</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:41.280"> and knock it out of gear, and go down that hill like the crappers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:44.700"> And I often think, well what if something came across the road?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:48.520"> I&#039;d have another chance.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:49.640"> Oh my goodness.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:50.520"> You do things when you&#039;re young, don&#039;t you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:51.980"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:54.440"> Yeah, I did three journeys for that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:56.320"> I brought the plow up, and I brought a big trailer up with implements and, and yes, it</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:01.500"> took me four and a half hours.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:02.980"> And were you the only child?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:04.480"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:05.400"> Ah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:05.940"> I haven&#039;t even got a cousin.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:07.660"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:08.280"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:08.720"> But my two aunts didn&#039;t marry.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:10.700"> My one aunt didn&#039;t marry, but we didn&#039;t have any family.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:13.420"> And then my uncle, he married.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:16.060"> He didn&#039;t have any family.</div></div><br>

Margaret</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:05.560"> Prosser and I can&#039;t see the name of your farm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:08.100"> What&#039;s the name of the farm?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:09.720"> Croynant.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:10.220"> C-R-Y-N-A-N-G.</div><div class="transcript_line"

Cuffilly.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:16.460"> Near Cuffilly.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:17.040"> I thought we were near Cuffilly.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:18.840"> And it is Friday, September the 6th, 2019.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:24.060"> So I&#039;m just going to pop that down there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:26.300"> When we were coming over the hill I could see, I thought, are we near Cuffilly?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:30.220"> I couldn&#039;t believe it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:31.020"> I didn&#039;t think we were that close.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:32.480"> You came up this road here.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:34.760"> So you&#039;re looking across there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:37.000"> It&#039;s a different perspective because it&#039;s gorgeous looking across the levels there,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:40.760"> isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:40.940"> Yes, yes it is.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:42.300"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line"

data-time="00:00:53.940"> Yes, that&#039;s right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:54.860"> Yes, it&#039;s not so clear today.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:56.120"> I suppose if we&#039;d had a rain this morning it makes it more limited, more on show.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:02.480"> You&#039;ve met Marjorie Neale, have you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:04.080"> Yes, I&#039;ve met Marjorie.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:05.340"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:05.860"> Are you related to her?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:07.120"> No, no, we&#039;re great friends.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:08.560"> Oh really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:09.200"> I&#039;m from a young farmer&#039;s days.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:10.760"> Oh crikey.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:11.540"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:12.780"> Oh, yeah, everyone&#039;s, it&#039;s so lovely.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:14.560"> Everyone, I have to say Margaret, everyone I&#039;ve met have been just adorable and so open</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:20.060"> and welcoming.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:21.000"> It&#039;s just so lovely.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:22.600"> It&#039;s making my job so much easier.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:24.300"> Because Marjorie was born there on the moors, she was born there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:29.960"> Would you know Steph Davis?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:34.440"> Oh, what&#039;s her maiden name?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:37.400"> I can&#039;t think of her maiden name now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:40.720"> She was born at Lower Newton House, I think.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:44.640"> Stephanie.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:45.440"> Stephanie.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:47.220"> I can&#039;t think of her name now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:49.200"> I&#039;ll think of it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:52.480"> But I wonder if we can just start off, if you could just tell us when you were born</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:57.640"> and where you were born.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:59.260"> I was born at 31 Herbert Avenue, Riska.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:05.640"> As I say, my mother was a farmer&#039;s daughter and my father worked in the steelworks.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:13.420"> We moved from there then to Park Place at Riska.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:16.840"> We lived there for quite a few years.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:18.640"> And then we moved from there then and took the farm at Langorse.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:23.160"> And that was 1946, 47, that&#039;s right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:32.040"> And then I moved back down then to Sluson in 1956 when I married Dewan.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:39.020"> So what was your father&#039;s name?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:41.260"> William Benjamin Thomas.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:43.300"> And your mother?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:44.400"> Minnie Harris.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:45.420"> Oh, that&#039;s a nice name, Minnie.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:46.720"> So your father worked in the steelworks, he says.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:49.760"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:50.780"> In Pontymester Steelworks, which is not there at the moment.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:53.380"> That was taken down some years ago.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:55.940"> Was that in Newport?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:57.260"> Riska.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:58.360"> Ah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:58.600"> Pontymester Riska.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:59.840"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:00.980"> So he wasn&#039;t a farmer at all?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:03.180"> No, no, no.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:05.040"> And then he had his sister, Evelyn Mary Thomas, and she was 44 years in Riska at a radio</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:12.000"> and a natural gas shop.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:13.340"> And then his other sister, Auntie Phyllis, Phyllis Thomas, she was a teacher up in Abercarne.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:22.420"> And they lived in, I&#039;ve got to think of the name of the place now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:29.640"> Oh dear, that&#039;s terrible.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:30.760"> They lived in Woodland Drive in Rogerstone.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:35.640"> I don&#039;t know whether you know that area, do you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:37.280"> No, I don&#039;t.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:37.540"> Do you know Riska at all?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:38.560"> Not very well at all, no.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:39.940"> No, you go up through Woodland Drive, Rogerstone up to Riska, and then of course you carry</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:44.440"> on up the valley then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:45.700"> So your mother was from a farming background?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:48.320"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:48.940"> Where was she from?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:49.920"> Newhouse Farm, Pontaig, near Pontipour.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:52.740"> Okay.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:53.120"> Well Newin it was really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:55.020"> So how did she meet your father?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:57.260"> Well I think my grandparents on my mother&#039;s side, father&#039;s side, lived in Newin.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:05.580"> And I think that&#039;s where dad used to go back and forth, you know, to see them and that&#039;s</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:09.220"> where they met I suppose.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:10.560"> It&#039;s funny how people do meet, don&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:13.120"> So your father had to learn how to be a farmer then, seemingly.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:16.200"> Yes, he was always interested.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:18.020"> His cousin used to keep the Mardie Farm, Courcourneau, just below the Courcourneau Golf Course.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:23.280"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:23.900"> And he spent a lot of time there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:26.880"> So that, you know, he really got fed up with the, as the saying is, the stearworks.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:32.480"> So he thought they&#039;d branch out and they had this farming land course then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:36.160"> And we took that over Lockstock and Barry.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:37.820"> We took over the, when they say Lockstock and Barry, we took over the stock and rented</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:43.220"> the farm there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:45.840"> Land course and I liked land course very much.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:49.600"> We&#039;d look out for the door and you could see the plenivan.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:52.240"> Oh yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:53.060"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:53.540"> And 1947 was a winter.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:55.560"> Oh terrible.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:56.460"> Was it really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:56.980"> Oh shocking yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:58.240"> I mean we had tremendous snow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:00.440"> The milk didn&#039;t go from there to the, with the lorry for over a week.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:04.140"> Wow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:04.720"> Because we were snowed up.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:05.940"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:06.280"> We went out to the hedges.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:07.480"> Crikey.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:07.960"> And then there was a camp of Italians at Bulk and there was another, the Germans in, Italian,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:18.400"> German soldiers in Brecon and they kept through really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:23.240"> Amazing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:23.580"> Yes it was, it was horrendous.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:26.180"> So and then I used to go to school in Brecon then from land course.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:30.740"> Walk up to the hill.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:32.160"> I used to hate school.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:33.880"> I&#039;d rather be home doing the work there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:37.960"> And I used to, I was sightless sometimes but I&#039;d walk at the times and I used to really</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:42.460"> doodle you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:43.960"> And then I&#039;d hear the train coming around from Talga to Brecon and stop at the Land</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:47.520"> Course Halt and I&#039;d try to, but no I never got there and I came home and then my father</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:52.380"> said look you cannot do this you see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:54.840"> You must, you&#039;ve got to go to school.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:56.800"> I said well I don&#039;t like school.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:58.660"> So I left when I was fifteen.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:00.860"> So that was my story of school in Brecon.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:04.060"> Crikey.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:05.420"> So how old were you when your family moved down here?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:08.780"> Or when I say here, over there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:11.180"> Oh to Berry Hill.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:12.420"> So where is Berry Hill?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:13.940"> It&#039;s on the main road, go through Castleton, it&#039;s Newport and before you get down to where</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:20.140"> there&#039;s a big walk over a bridge, well it&#039;s on the right hand side before you get there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:26.320"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:27.120"> It&#039;s not there now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:28.480"> Is it gone?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:29.060"> No the farm is still there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:31.340"> Well they were, pick your own.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:33.820"> But they haven&#039;t done that for some time now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:38.080"> And there&#039;s a bungalow that&#039;s built next to it which the person that took over after</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:43.700"> my mother and father finished, he was there for some time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:47.560"> Well I&#039;ll tell you who was there, it was Robert Peel.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:50.240"> You know Robert Peel, this is his grandson but his name was Robert.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:53.760"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:54.160"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:54.680"> Amazing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:55.720"> So why did your parents move from Langhorth?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:59.200"> Why did they come here?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:00.880"> Well because, well it was a bit bigger farm and we liked this area more because my parents,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:07.200"> well my father particularly moved from this area and as I say his cousin used to farm</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:13.420"> the farm down below so there&#039;s quite a lot of, you know over there with them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:18.100"> And then, so did your parents move to Sleuth&#039;s Farm or was that you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:22.480"> No I moved to Sleuth&#039;s Farm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:24.060"> I married from Berry Hill and married Dilwyn from Sleuth&#039;s Farm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:28.040"> So how did you meet Dilwyn?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:29.720"> Oh Young Farmers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:32.520"> It&#039;s quite a matter of how many places we did.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:36.140"> Yes Young Farmers, that&#039;s who we belonged to.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:38.400"> So was it very active then Young Farmers?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:40.820"> Yes we were, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:43.360"> St. Malan&#039;s Young Farmers it went under.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:45.440"> But I did belong to the Llynsefad and Young Farmers in Bracken or Langhorth when I was</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:50.000"> there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:50.260"> And yes we were quite active you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:54.360"> Yes we slept and fenced, we&#039;d go to different shows and so forth you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:59.220"> But oh yes it&#039;s quite a matter of how many places Young Farmers had.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:03.620"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:04.640"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:05.020"> I&#039;ve heard that so many times people who&#039;ve met through, it must be an informal marriage</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:10.460"> bureau.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:11.080"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:12.480"> Crikey.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:13.340"> Oh yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:14.900"> So you met Dilwyn and then he was already living at?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:18.500"> He was born down in Sleuth&#039;s.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:19.920"> He was born there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:20.600"> Yes, yes and he&#039;s got two sisters.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:23.700"> One is Betty which is two years younger, older and she&#039;s living in Gloucester.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:30.260"> She&#039;s 19 now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:31.740"> And then the other sister lived at, did you see who met Derek?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:36.320"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:36.840"> Well Derek&#039;s mother was his sister to Dilwyn.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:39.480"> Oh okay.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:40.200"> Doreen.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:40.760"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:41.320"> She died, oh she wasn&#039;t very old, she was quite good cancer bad and very sad it was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:47.080"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:47.640"> And that&#039;s right Derek.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:49.560"> So how have we met, how did you come to meet Derek, excuse me, ask it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:53.400"> Well Derek and Andrew were both through John Souther who worked for the drainage board.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:58.140"> Ah right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:59.320"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:59.460"> Yes he&#039;s the chap that goes round cleaning them and talking to all the landowners and</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:04.840"> stuff.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:05.580"> So John introduced me to, he said you&#039;ve got to speak to Derek and Andrew Prosser.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:09.880"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:10.460"> So that and then that&#039;s why I&#039;m here now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:12.940"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:13.340"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:13.600"> Very grateful to him.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:14.620"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:15.240"> Well my father Prosser he was on the drainage board and he was supposed to lend at different</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:19.540"> meetings and that you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:20.940"> So that&#039;s Dilwyn&#039;s father.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:23.720"> So what was his full name?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:25.240"> Winford.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:25.960"> Winford Prosser.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:27.620"> So what.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:28.240"> And his wife was living at Lansoy and I don&#039;t know how they met.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:35.280"> Let me see, I think Dilwyn&#039;s father had a housekeeper and then my mother-in-law Marjorie,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:43.620"> she was Marjorie, she came down to meet her and then they seemed to get friendly and then</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:50.800"> they married you see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:52.460"> Yes Lansoy.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:53.760"> Lansoy at the side desk.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:56.100"> So what was, sorry what was his name Winford?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:59.880"> Winford.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:00.480"> Winford.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:01.380"> So he was on the drainage board.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:03.200"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:04.000"> Yes and Dilwyn was on the drainage board.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:06.760"> So I&#039;m getting confused.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:07.540"> So Winford is Dilwyn&#039;s father.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:09.100"> That&#039;s right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:09.720"> So Winford was on the drainage board.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:12.120"> So what can you tell me about Dilwyn&#039;s parents on the farm?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:18.900"> Well, Dilwyn&#039;s dad Winford has got a brother, I&#039;ll show you photographs of them afterwards.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:26.600"> Campbell Prosser, he was a barrister-in-law and he was out abroad for a long time in Singapore.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:32.100"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:32.520"> And then he had a sister, which I&#039;ve got the photograph, the whole family&#039;s up there,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:37.480"> you can see later on.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:38.440"> And then he had a sister that lived in Cardiff Road and then is Missy Campbell and then there</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:51.680"> was Dilwyn who was killed in the war, first world war and that was Winford.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:59.620"> Well I&#039;ll have to, I can show you the photograph.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:02.320"> It&#039;s on the wall so it&#039;s easy for you to have a look at it on the wall really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:05.820"> So that was, that was Dilwyn&#039;s father&#039;s side, you see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:09.760"> And they had butcher shops in Cardiff, Clifton Street.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:14.340"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:14.600"> There was a big butchery in there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:16.480"> And that was their business more or less, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:19.520"> So a butchery shop.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:22.000"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:22.260"> Butcher shop.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:22.820"> So when did the farm come into the...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:26.400"> Well Winford, he wasn&#039;t keen on the butchery shop so he went farming then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:31.380"> So he took over, took sluice and rented sluice.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:34.860"> Oh right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:35.620"> And then of course the milk.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:36.880"> And then they used to have a milk round with a milk van and everything.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:41.600"> And Dilwyn used to go occasionally when his father had a meeting up in London but he wasn&#039;t</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:46.160"> so keen on the milk round.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:50.020"> But he used to do it when his father had to go to London for meetings with the drainage</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:54.420"> port and that, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:55.600"> So why did they have meetings in London?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:58.600"> I don&#039;t know really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:00.400"> And of course they used to have the meetings out at Magad, didn&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:06.100"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:06.720"> That&#039;s the place.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:07.600"> Is it Magad?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:08.620"> Yes, Magad, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:09.840"> They used to have the...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:10.800"> Oh, Nash?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:11.680"> Nash rather.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:12.700"> That&#039;s right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:13.100"> Pie Corner.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:13.920"> That&#039;s right, Pie Corner.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:15.160"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:15.360"> Yes, Nash.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:16.340"> Yes, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:18.120"> So was it always a dairy farm then, the sluice farm?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:23.220"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:24.520"> Yes, they had cows and everything and sheep.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:27.360"> But, and then we moved up here later and then they moved there but then they went out to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:33.860"> the cows and so the Andros only got the sheep at the moment.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:37.780"> So then you met Dilwyn?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:40.440"> Three young farmers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:41.500"> Three young farmers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:42.560"> And so where did you marry actually?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:47.040"> In Coorkeen O&#039;Church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:48.060"> Oh, did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:48.500"> It&#039;s a dear little church, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:50.020"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:50.200"> It&#039;s a house now that&#039;s been turned into...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:51.900"> Yes, Coorkeen.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:52.580"> Do you know, do you know, well, you know the main one I said about this article is you</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:58.320"> turn down for Coorkeen for the golf course?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:00.940"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:01.220"> And it&#039;s just before you get to the golf course.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:04.040"> Or just after the golf course, sorry.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:05.420"> On the right?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:06.040"> On the left-hand side you&#039;ve got a little lane up to the church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:09.500"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:10.000"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:10.440"> Oh, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve been to the church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:12.300"> Oh, I don&#039;t think...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:12.860"> It&#039;s a house now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:14.260"> It&#039;s...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:14.660"> Was it a chapel then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:15.780"> Or was it a chapel?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:16.320"> No, a church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:17.500"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:18.180"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:18.520"> Yeah, Coorkeen O&#039;Church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:19.300"> Oh, I have to go back that way afterwards.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:21.220"> I might go and have a look.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:22.500"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:24.360"> And I think there&#039;s three or four houses there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:27.560"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:28.080"> Because there was a farm next to it but they&#039;ve gone into, into homesteads, you see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:32.800"> So then, so did you then start your married life at Soos Farm?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:36.720"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:37.420"> You moved in with your in-laws?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:39.520"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:40.040"> No, no, they moved, they built a house.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:41.920"> Do you see the house on the side there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:43.240"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:43.640"> They built that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:44.660"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:45.140"> And then we went into the farmhouse and they built, built that and went into there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:49.600"> So this would have been what, the mid-fifties?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:52.900"> Yes, 57.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:54.520"> 57?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:55.420"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:55.840"> So, so what was the farm doing then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:58.740"> Was it...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:59.560"> Milk.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:00.260"> Milk.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:00.560"> Milk and milk round.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:01.860"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:02.400"> Yeah, and they&#039;d fill the bottles, you know, and wash the bottles then in the little shed</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:06.660"> that was there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:07.380"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:08.700"> That&#039;s...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:09.200"> Yes, I think I&#039;ve got a photograph here.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:12.200"> Excuse me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:14.180"> How many cows did you have, Margaret?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:16.760"> Hmm?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:17.020"> How many cows did you have?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:19.800"> Well, not like they got today, they got hundreds today, haven&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:22.560"> But they were only about 125.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:24.320"> That&#039;s dope.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:25.000"> Which was quite, you know, big for those days, I suppose, wasn&#039;t it, you know?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:29.040"> Yes, I&#039;ve got a photograph here, I think, aren&#039;t there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:33.160"> And that wasn&#039;t all hand-milked, was it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:36.340"> Was that all milked by hand?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:38.520"> Well, it was years ago and then they went in with the machines then, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:45.160"> This is a photograph, this is Lewis House.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:48.300"> This was before 1963.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:52.860"> That&#039;s where it was when I used to live there, you see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:54.760"> Oh, crikey.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:55.320"> There was a milk van right there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:57.000"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:57.600"> A dairy there where they used to wash the bottles.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:00.600"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:01.140"> Cows used to go into there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:02.400"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:02.940"> And then this was the garden, I mean, Anne&#039;s got a beautiful garden down there now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:06.980"> And then there was just a shed where we kept chickens.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:09.360"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:09.760"> So it all altered, of course, because all this is buildings here now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:14.060"> This is all changed, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:15.560"> Yeah, all different.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:16.000"> I mean, it&#039;s all built up.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:18.180"> Very rural then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:18.580"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:19.480"> It was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:20.320"> Crikey.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:21.120"> And then in this field here, which was owned, that&#039;s where they built the house, you can</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:26.700"> see Wyvern.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:27.880"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:28.360"> You know, they built that there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:29.880"> Did they build that because Dilwyn was getting married?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:33.700"> Yes, yes, they built that to go in there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:36.120"> And, oh, it was only thinking the other day.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:40.820"> I think it was about 90.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:43.840"> Oh, I&#039;ve forgotten the money.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:45.500"> I&#039;m just thinking about how much it costs the other day.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:48.700"> The bridge costs nearly more to get across the reed to get to the house than the house,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:53.440"> I think.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:53.860"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:54.460"> Yes, it was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:55.080"> You forget about that, don&#039;t you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:56.840"> Yes, you do.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:57.280"> You have to get across the reed.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:58.340"> That&#039;s true.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:58.940"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:00.340"> So what were your first impressions when you moved down there and started married life?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:04.940"> Well, I used to go back and forth there before we were actually married, you know, and have</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:09.320"> supper and things with Mother-in-law and that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:14.140"> And, yes, well, I liked it very much because we had ground with Berry Hill.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:19.040"> We had two fields on the moors, as we call them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:21.620"> Okay, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:23.500"> And rented those.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:25.520"> And so it wasn&#039;t any different for me really, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:28.880"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:29.460"> And then, of course, we used to go to young farmers there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:31.660"> We used to go to young farmers club in St. Melan&#039;s.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:33.880"> Did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:34.700"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:35.400"> St. Chaple used to hold the young farmers meetings.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:38.620"> But, oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:40.600"> So I enjoyed life.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:41.880"> A farmer&#039;s wife.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:42.840"> So I&#039;ve spoken to lots of farmers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:45.540"> And so as a farmer&#039;s wife, would you have been aware of and concerned with all the reams</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:53.040"> and the maintenance and stuff?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:54.740"> I mean, I guess what I&#039;m trying to ask is, was there very much a clear, this was what</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:59.400"> the woman did and this is what the men did, or was it all mixed up?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:04.020"> Well, I think I used to enjoy going out and feeding calves and things and that, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:10.200"> And then when I was born, we used to put him in the plan, put him in the corner of the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:14.380"> milking shed and he&#039;d be sat there, you know, watching the cows coming in and out and all</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:18.480"> that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:19.340"> And before we had a parlour that was the milking parlour type of thing, you know, where you</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:24.840"> could get up and in and mushing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:26.700"> But, yeah, I&#039;ve always been interested outside.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:30.880"> I used to spend quite a bit of time before we went to Langhorst with my grandparents</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:37.420"> at Newhouse Farm, Pantague.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:39.880"> You know, just go out there and stay when I was a little tot, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:43.260"> Put me on the bus and you put my aunt with me and you in.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:47.060"> How lovely.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:48.080"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:48.520"> So did you ever get involved in the bottling of milk down there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:52.280"> I used to have sometimes and that helped.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:54.780"> My father probably used to, you know, mostly he&#039;d do that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:58.440"> I&#039;d have to come back off the road.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:59.640"> And then wash the bottles and get them ready then to fill up the next morning.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:05.280"> You know, it&#039;s, yeah, oh yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:08.100"> Oh yes, I&#039;ve had a very enjoyable life really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:11.720"> You can tell that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:12.900"> It shows in your face.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:14.040"> It&#039;s lovely.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:14.980"> Yeah, it does.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:16.240"> What about the poultry?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:17.340"> Was that an important part of the family?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:19.300"> Yeah, we used to sell eggs on the milk farm quite a lot, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:23.760"> And then if there was any surplus eggs then, I used to bring them to the husband brothers</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:28.540"> who used to have, well, I don&#039;t know, what do you call it, an egg centre that they would have eggs</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:37.520"> and then they&#039;d take them out on different rounds.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:39.780"> Where were the husband brothers based?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:43.340"> It&#039;s in Lysvyn.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:44.460"> Oh really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:45.140"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:46.020"> But that&#039;s all different now altogether.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:48.520"> You know, places change, don&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:50.660"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:51.380"> Well it&#039;s interesting, look at the news photograph, because you must have seen enormous change</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:56.060"> in your lifetime down there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:57.480"> Oh yes, yeah, especially now, more buildings up for stock and everything, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:02.960"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:03.320"> And I mean, I used to try and keep it, well, clean, tidy and all this.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:07.540"> And we used to have a boy living in then, you see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:10.100"> Did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:10.520"> Yes, yes, you know the, excuse me, you know the kitchen.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:15.560"> You&#039;re going for the back door, don&#039;t you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:17.840"> That&#039;s the dining room, the kitchen for every day.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:20.400"> Then there&#039;s the kitchen, isn&#039;t there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:21.960"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:22.280"> Then there&#039;s the other room.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:23.900"> We used to have a boy living in there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:25.640"> Did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:26.000"> Yes, yeah, and he had his bed in there and there was a stove in the corner, we used</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:31.380"> to have for the fire and he had an armchair.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:33.680"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:33.720"> He always ate with us.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:34.980"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:35.700"> And yes, so we always had a boy living in.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:39.700"> And who was he, was it a series of people or?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:43.660"> Well yes, different, we had a few from St. Brides that didn&#039;t live in, they came back</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:48.520"> and forth, which is, you know, from Cocoonia.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:51.080"> But a couple of, they actually lived in there, you know, with us and they&#039;d eat with us and</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:56.940"> all this business, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:59.360"> I mean, he had a television, well not a television, a wireless monitor, but he did have a television</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:03.620"> towards the end.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:06.600"> And yes, we always had a boy living in.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:08.600"> I suppose the farm could support that, whereas it would be difficult to do that today, wouldn&#039;t</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:13.860"> it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:13.980"> Well I suppose, yes, it&#039;s the different ideas today, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:19.340"> Yeah, different world today really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:21.900"> It&#039;s a strange lot to really be farming, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:24.340"> But did you have sheep then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:26.220"> Yes, we had some sheep, yeah, pet lambs and something, you know, feed those.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:31.920"> Yes, I can&#039;t remember how many sheep, we didn&#039;t have so many sheep as well now, naturally,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:36.440"> because we had the dairying as well, you see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:41.040"> Yes, oh yes, I&#039;ve enjoyed my life up until now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:47.500"> So Antem used to go up onto the seawall and bring the sheep in on pony.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:51.720"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:52.420"> Did you ever get involved with that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:53.840"> No, not really, no, no.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:56.340"> Yes, we&#039;d put sheep over on the seawall and then my Doreen, Derek&#039;s father, Philip, would</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:05.120"> come over and he&#039;d have this horse and a little trap thing, you know, and they&#039;d sit in there</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:09.820"> and then they&#039;d go up then to get onto the horse and to bring the sheep up and all this</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:14.040"> business, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:14.680"> And then one day, I don&#039;t know what happened, but anyhow, the pony started kicking the bottom</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:20.540"> of the possum and of course got out of the showers and left these four or five of them</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:26.960"> and the possum went backwards while it was suffering.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:30.680"> What, backwards down the slope?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:32.020"> Well, it went back, it went back, back, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:34.340"> Oh, I see, because the horse had gone.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:35.360"> There were the showers hanging over them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:38.120"> Were they OK?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:39.020"> Well, they were all right and the dog jumped out a bit quick and the dog was in as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:44.260"> Oh dear, yeah, they used to come up every Sunday and go down and see the sheep and all</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:50.080"> sorts of those and bring them up.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:51.960"> Because the sheep used to graze on the other side of it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:54.380"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:56.400"> So.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:56.860"> Until, like, the tide used to come in so far, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:00.720"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:01.360"> But they hired the, I think they hired the bank then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:07.660"> Yes, they did hire it because of course the sea, the water was coming, the sea was getting</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:12.700"> higher, wasn&#039;t it, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:14.420"> Because you&#039;re very close to the seawall there, aren&#039;t you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:16.740"> Oh yes, it&#039;s only the field really, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:18.980"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:19.080"> The field across.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:19.680"> Did you ever experience the water coming over?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:22.420"> You see it sometimes if it was very rough, just splashing up a bit, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:27.280"> That&#039;s, you know, I never had the thought in mind of thinking, oh gosh, I hope it doesn&#039;t</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:32.760"> come over there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:34.600"> I never thought of that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:35.800"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:36.240"> Which I suppose it has, well, it has in some places over the years, hasn&#039;t it, you see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:40.600"> Did you ever use the shore where the sheet grates?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:43.840"> Is there like a picnic spot when you had children when they were little?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:46.560"> Yeah, we used to go over there and like a lot of the, have you been over there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:52.280"> You&#039;ve been over there, of course.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:54.240"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:54.720"> I haven&#039;t been over there for years really, so I don&#039;t know what it&#039;s like.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:57.780"> But we used to have little, what&#039;s the name of the water coming in, where there&#039;s been</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:03.120"> bits and digits.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:04.280"> Yeah, like rivulets.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:05.420"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:06.880"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:07.080"> Yeah, yes, we used to go over there with our neighbours, Edins, Snackers Farm, Loose Farm,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:12.080"> that would be, the one just on the side of the road.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:15.580"> And, yes, we&#039;d go over there for picnics and, yeah, we used to have a, you know, now and</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:20.720"> again, have a good time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:22.140"> Was it, was it, was there a real sense of community there then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:31.180"> Down the village, yeah, you mean the village itself?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:34.640"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:35.040"> Oh yes, because those opposite the hall, those are all built, you see, because when</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:41.660"> I went down there first, there was no houses there then, you know, so they&#039;d been built.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:45.900"> And at the back of the hall is a little cul-de-sac.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:48.800"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:49.540"> That&#039;s the council houses further over, they were there when I went down.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:55.280"> And different houses had been built around there, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:58.360"> Yes, oh it&#039;s nice, I mean, I&#039;m quite upset really, because WI had been a member for 62</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:04.520"> years down there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:05.640"> Have you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:06.240"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:07.220"> And I used to take my mother-in-law, because she didn&#039;t drive, during her mother&#039;s</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:10.660"> didn&#039;t drive.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:11.740"> So when then, after lunch, we&#039;d go down on the second Tuesday of the month, I used to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:17.460"> pick her up and we&#039;d go down, because she was president at that time, and there was</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:21.720"> the back of the old black stove, I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve seen the old black stove,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:26.300"> it was like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:27.460"> In the village hall?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:28.340"> In the village hall.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:29.620"> And then put the chairs and tables up, and then go back then, and I&#039;d pick her up then</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:34.020"> at sea then to go to WI.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:36.860"> And yes, we did that for years.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:40.020"> And then I used to have the milk van then, I had the milk van for a couple of, or for</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:44.540"> about a week or more in the afternoons, to go to a place in Bremne to get a sanding machine,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:51.140"> and then put in the back there, and then we&#039;d do the floor, you know, get the floor nice</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:56.220"> and, well, slim you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:57.260"> Yeah?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:57.660"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:58.120"> Oh, we&#039;ve had some good times down there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:00.060"> Really good times.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:00.480"> Somebody was telling me that St. Price WI used to have a canning machine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:05.880"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:06.480"> Do you know about that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:07.380"> Yes, yes, and Mother Prosser had it, and where it is I don&#039;t know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:11.860"> Yes, because we used to put fruit into our own canning.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:14.760"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:15.940"> I wonder where it is, now I&#039;ve forgotten about that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:22.700"> I wonder where that is now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:26.360"> Yes, now I wonder where that is.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:29.640"> You&#039;ve got me thinking now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:32.240"> I&#039;ll be trying to explore where it is.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:34.060"> So would the WI rent it out, or would they take it out to people and say, do the canning</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:40.260"> for people?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:41.960"> I couldn&#039;t, I can&#039;t say that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:44.240"> I mean, I know we used to borrow it and do our own, at least Mother Prosser did more</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:49.840"> than I did, but I&#039;d give a hand, you know, but that&#039;s interesting how you brought up</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:55.160"> that canning machine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:55.740"> That&#039;s going to bother you now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:56.580"> I&#039;d be worried about that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:58.360"> It&#039;d be lovely if it&#039;s still around somewhere.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:01.580"> Yes, yes it would wouldn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:04.180"> And it&#039;s still going, the St Brides WI?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:07.020"> St Brides, no, no, it&#039;s folded up a long time ago.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:09.700"> Oh really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:10.560"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:10.700"> Oh that&#039;s a shame.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:12.260"> So a lot of the people from there now come to Peterstone, and this is why I&#039;m rather</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:17.460"> upset that Peterstone is talking about folding it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:20.120"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:21.600"> I mean the secretary, she&#039;s moving away down to Swansea, well that&#039;s fine, the president,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:26.940"> she did say that she&#039;d do it for another two years, well the two years has come up now,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:33.160"> and no one else wants to take the responsibility.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:36.060"> That&#039;s such a shame.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:36.740"> It is a shame, it is a shame.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:38.440"> And it&#039;s been going how long?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:39.660"> Well I&#039;ve been down there 62 years.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:42.820"> That&#039;s phenomenal, Margaret.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:44.640"> And it was on a long time before that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:47.020"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:47.540"> Yes, it&#039;s sad really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:48.860"> How many members have you got down there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:51.880"> There&#039;s, from St Brides area, around Asda where people live, I expect there&#039;s 14 people</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:01.180"> come from that area, and it seems such a shame that no one will take it on.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:08.140"> After all that time?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:09.060"> Yes, it is, because I was president for about seven years after Mother Pross has given it</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:15.460"> up, I don&#039;t know how long she was, but no, it&#039;s quite sad.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:19.180"> I was quite upset about it really, but I&#039;m hoping that I might join Kevin Madley, Michael</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:27.380"> Stoneman, which is nearer, but the distance didn&#039;t make any difference to me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:33.620"> It&#039;s a longevity though isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:35.320"> Winds and weathers, pick up a couple of ladies from our school on the way down.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:39.280"> Oh, how sweet.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:40.120"> Yes, you just enjoy it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:42.080"> That&#039;s how it goes, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:43.220"> So you said Mother Pross used to can fruit.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:50.100"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:50.800"> Where did her fruit come from?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:27:52.580"> Oh well, we had plum trees, we had trees, we had plum trees, and we had a couple of trees around here,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:01.240"> plum trees and things, and well, that was our garden then, you know, and then we&#039;d have beans and stuff like that,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:08.900"> you know, to roast it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:10.900"> But yeah, I&#039;ve forgotten about that canning machine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:14.960"> So what was the process then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:16.280"> So you&#039;d pick the fruit and then wash it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:18.840"> Yes, and then make a syrup, and then put it in the tins, and then with the machine you&#039;d seal it all,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:26.980"> and that would be your tinned fruit.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:28.880"> Gosh, and that would last all the winter?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:30.940"> Well yes, if you make as much as you can, you know, or we could.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:36.700"> And yes, gosh, I&#039;m glad you thought about the canning machine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:40.360"> You&#039;ve got me worried now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:41.720"> Well it&#039;s come up a few times, you see, so I thought, I&#039;m curious.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:45.080"> I&#039;ve never heard of a canning machine before.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:47.920"> And that St. Bride&#039;s WI has a canning machine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:50.760"> It just sounds really resourceful to me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:28:53.340"> Yes, that&#039;s right. Yes, yes. I wonder where that is now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:00.060"> Did the WI, because in the past the WI has been absolutely fantastic at recording local people and their memories,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:08.100"> did the St. Bride&#039;s WI ever do anything like that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:12.220"> No, they folded up as I said, and a couple of them came from there then, which are a few more now,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:17.880"> because the president it is now, she lives in one of the houses by our stairs,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:22.920"> and of course a couple of her friends have come as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:25.840"> As I say, I was quite upset last week when I knew it was going to fold up.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:29.980"> Oh, that is upsetting.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:30.940"> Yes, it is.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:32.860"> But there we are, people are not interested.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:35.140"> You can&#039;t force people to be.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:38.320"> You can&#039;t.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:39.120"> You can try and encourage.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:42.660"> So as a young woman, a young wife, was it part of one&#039;s social life, the WI?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:49.300"> It was really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:50.780"> Yes, yes, I went up to London for the two AGMs.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:29:56.880"> WI was something that you did as a young wife, and you have continued to do for a long time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:03.620"> Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, I enjoyed WI. I went to London to the AGM on two occasions, which is up at the Albert Hall,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:13.860"> and that was very interesting, where they come from all over the country.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:17.920"> Yes, it&#039;s gone back a bit.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:21.320"> But what struck me about down on the moors there, that it&#039;s quite a different landscape, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:27.420"> It&#039;s flat, all the water courses.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:29.740"> Oh yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:30.240"> Was that a challenge in some way?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:33.180"> I don&#039;t know whether you were a friend, because there&#039;s people living in the church now,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:38.300"> and on about, what am I, five foot, am I five foot or nothing?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:44.740"> It&#039;s up about, well I should know the place, where the Great Flood was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:49.980"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:30:50.880"> Yes, and the bank, you can see the bank, now we&#039;re one of the fields of one of the farms up, as you go down the road a bit.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:00.140"> Yes, well I think I&#039;m right in saying that the water more or less came up nearly up to Cancelledon.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:06.660"> Yes, because it goes down, doesn&#039;t it, apparently?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:09.640"> Yes, yes, it&#039;s very low, very low.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:11.460"> Did you ever experience flooding there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:14.240"> No, no. The rains would fill up quite a bit, you know, but no, no, we never had any flooding as such, no.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:21.200"> What was it like having young children around those things though? Was it ever a worry?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:26.280"> Oh yes, yes. Now the neighbours, on that farm down to West Farm then, they lost a child that drowned in the water.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:36.740"> And also in St Brides, the child drowned in St Brides in the rain.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:42.180"> Oh really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:43.060"> Yes, yes. But I suppose if you&#039;re born down there you get used to it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:31:50.880"> I know the one that came down further on down the road was from London, came down to see the sister, came down and brought the little one, of course went down the steps and drowned in the rain there, you know, which was very sad.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:04.800"> Oh gosh, that&#039;s so sad, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:06.600"> Terrible, terrible. Yes, but...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:10.740"> When you first went to Sleuth&#039;s Farm, was there electricity and stuff?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:15.800"> Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, because when I lived in Langorce we had no electric.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:20.200"> No?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:20.820"> I got the Aladdin lamp there, the hanging Aladdin lamp, and I&#039;ve got a little table lamp that&#039;s in there, that&#039;s with oil, and we didn&#039;t have any hot water, cold water, anything like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:32.820"> Can you talk about the winter of 47? What was the winter of 62, 63 like?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:38.060"> I was down here then, of course.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:40.420"> Oh here?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:41.120"> Yes, it was bad then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:43.480"> I used to go up to Castleton with the tractor to have the lorry to come down, you know, to bring it down.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:51.120"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:32:51.480"> And then in the evenings then, a couple of the locals there, the youngsters, they&#039;d take me down the six bells on a big boat, drag it down the road, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:04.700"> Oh yes, we had quite a lot of snow. Yes, yes, yes, but we had more when we were in Langorce.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:09.780"> I can remember seeing on Pennavan, down one of the crevices, in June, there was still snow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:17.200"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:17.860"> I can see that now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:19.160"> My goodness. It went on and on and on, didn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:20.700"> Oh it did, it did.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:21.980"> Did anyone ever go skating on the Reens or anything like that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:25.000"> On the lake. Oh sorry, on Langorce Lake they used to go, but I mean, well it was frozen over and a motorbike went across and it&#039;s never known before.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:34.980"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:35.420"> It went across the other side.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:36.760"> I&#039;ve never heard that before.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:33:38.700"> Yeah, they rep me did.

Is it a very close-knit farming community?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:23.820"> Yes, I think so, yes, yes, you know, we do a lot of things together.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:28.220"> We had two donkeys and this donkey down Slose and then we put her in full and oh,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:37.460"> you&#039;ve never seen such sweet things when this little one came.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:40.820"> I think the whole village came down to see it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:42.860"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:43.320"> Oh, just the deal thing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:45.140"> Someone told me that farmers kept donkeys because they were good luck.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:49.020"> Well, yes, they, they, they, they do, a lot of people had donkeys with the cattle.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:54.980"> Hmm, I&#039;ve never heard that before.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:35:57.460"> Yes, yes, I don&#039;t know whether it&#039;s, oh, there&#039;s the, I spent it this hand, this one, ten grand.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:03.580"> This is in 1955, I sold my sheep and I bought the little sports car.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:09.220"> Is that you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:10.140"> Yeah, no, that&#039;s not me, that&#039;s my mother and my aunt, but that&#039;s the little car I bought.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:14.600"> You bought it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:15.420"> Yes, I sold the sheep and I bought the little car.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:18.040"> Oh, I think that&#039;s so impressive. That must have been very unusual for a young woman there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:23.180"> Oh, yeah, we used to have some fun. We used to go following the hounds.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:27.720"> Did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:27.960"> Yes, on the top there and, yeah, and then one day, walking back to the car and here comes the local policeman with a steering wheel in his hand.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:38.300"> He&#039;d take the steering wheel off.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:39.780"> Why?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:40.480"> I went to Blackpool in that and back.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:43.320"> Oh my goodness, you and me, what sort of car is it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:36:46.280"> It was a, a built-up Le Mans, the Singer.

you go?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:05.000"> And the Tredegar Hunt was based in Beyslech, but it&#039;s all been built on now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:12.220"> Yeah?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:13.140"> So they&#039;ve gone up to Gelligeir, the hounds up there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:16.560"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:16.940"> So, I mean, we use them if we have dead stock or something.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:21.480"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:21.900"> We pay so much a year for them to pick it up, to take it up to the, you know, us, them, you know.</div><div

class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:29.000"> And who would you do that with?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:30.720"> On the top of Penelan, I don&#039;t know, Penelan.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:32.700"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:33.180"> Up there, we&#039;d be up there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:34.560"> It&#039;s like an orchard there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:36.680"> Yes, yes, we used to have trees.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:39.300"> So did you get apples off those as well?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:41.700"> Yes, apples and pears.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:43.100"> Did you ever make cider from them?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:45.320"> No, no, but we used to can them.</div><div

was the orchard here?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:54.460"> There.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:55.140"> Oh, gosh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:56.020"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:56.640"> Okay.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:37:57.600"> And this was my garden out by here.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:02.120"> Did you ever have horses on your farm?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:05.120"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:05.940"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:06.560"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:06.920"> No, just the two donkeys.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:08.460"> Oh, we did...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:09.140"> Oh gosh, that&#039;s me when I was...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:10.860"> Oh, I shouldn&#039;t be showing you this.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:12.280"> This is 1951.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:13.120"> Oh, please do.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:13.760"> I represented Langorce in Breckenshire.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:19.340"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:20.480"> So when it was haymaking, would you have had to make all the lunches for everyone coming</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:24.580"> in who was helping with the haymaking?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:25.620"> Yes, usually in the evening I&#039;d cook ham, potatoes and stuff like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:30.660"> They&#039;d come in at a separate time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:32.100"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:32.500"> Not so much in the daytime.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:34.000"> I mean, they&#039;d have someone to eat sandwiches or something.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:36.420"> But I used to cook dinner in the evening for them to come in.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:39.620"> Yes, and they&#039;d come back.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:40.600"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:41.220"> Yes, we had a lovely life really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:44.140"> And that was me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:45.540"> So did you ever... you were probably then too young to have ever thatched hay ricks then</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:50.360"> and stuff?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:52.460"> Well, yes, I&#039;ve seen them done.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:54.840"> Have you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:55.340"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:38:55.840"> When I was up, my grandparents, they used to do it there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:00.360"> But of course we&#039;ve always had the bands and of course the bales now, but we used to do</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:04.140"> small bales.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:05.140"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:05.600"> I think there&#039;s a certain amount of small bales now, if I remember rightly, because</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:11.220"> it&#039;s the round ones now, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:12.720"> Yes, of course.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:14.220"> Yes, big round ones.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:16.500"> Yes, all times have altered.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:18.380"> So was there any... there&#039;s something I&#039;ve been meaning to ask and I&#039;ve forgotten to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:21.560"> ask everybody else, but was there... excuse me... any food or meals?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:29.600"> So for example, my parents are Irish and a traditional meal we would have would be boiled</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:37.900"> ham, parsley sauce and something called chump, which was potatoes and onions and cabbage.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:44.380"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:44.920"> Is there anything on the morse that was traditional like that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:48.180"> Any particular dishes or...?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:49.540"> I used to always boil ham.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:51.140"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:51.780"> You know, I liked boiled ham, sliced and potatoes and stuff like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:39:56.580"> No, I suppose... I think it&#039;s a thing that&#039;s... a farmhouse meal, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:05.940"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:05.960"> Boiled ham, potatoes, peas, parsley sauce, you know, that type of thing, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:12.780"> So you would always be in the kitchen providing food for people working on the farm?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:16.860"> Yes, yes, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:18.560"> Oh yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:19.760"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:20.480"> And yes, I used to go out and feed the children with the chicken in there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:25.420"> I used to feed the poultry and all that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:29.380"> But yes, and they&#039;d come in then about two-waps, ten, eleven o&#039;clock and then they&#039;d sit down</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:34.420"> and have supper and then they&#039;d go about twelve o&#039;clock, one o&#039;clock.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:37.960"> Wow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:39.320"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:40.120"> I used to enjoy the haymaking.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:41.920"> The harvest time used to be lovely.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:44.580"> Why did you like it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:46.100"> Because it was just a...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:48.100"> Well, me too, they used to come in and have a rest and then, you know, we&#039;d go haul in</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:53.880"> the bales and all this business, you know, the loose hay years ago.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:57.140"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:40:57.560"> I thought I had a photograph here of...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:00.700"> I haven&#039;t got one.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:02.100"> I thought I had a photograph here of the...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:05.360"> Oh, what was it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:06.140"> So do you remember any of the people who used to work for the drainage board that used to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:10.440"> come round and clear the reams and stuff?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:15.880"> Erm...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:16.280"> Oh dear, what was his name?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:17.400"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:19.120"> I can see him now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:20.820"> Oh really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:24.380"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:25.100"> Oh, they&#039;re looking to me in a moment.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:27.740"> Yes, he was just slashed over the long-handled hook.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:30.840"> Oh, do you remember that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:31.820"> Down the Broadway.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:32.480"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:33.000"> Down the Broadway particularly.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:34.280"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:35.940"> Erm...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:36.160"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:37.560"> Ha ha.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:41.560"> Well, the one that&#039;s died now, a couple of months ago.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:45.020"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:46.760"> Erm...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:48.480"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:49.780"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:50.800"> I can&#039;t think of the other gentleman.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:52.300"> I can see him now doing it, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:56.160"> Well, that&#039;s silly, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:57.620"> It&#039;ll come to you.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:58.800"> It&#039;ll come.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:41:59.960"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:00.220"> And so Dilwyn was on the drainage board?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:02.540"> Yeah, Dilwyn was on the drainage board and his father was before him.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:05.480"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:06.080"> So what did that mean?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:07.320"> Does it mean just, you know, was it an important role?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:12.520"> Erm...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:13.000"> Well, I suppose it controlled the reams and everything really, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:16.500"> The drainage board more or less, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:18.560"> It&#039;s to see that they were cut and the reeds were cut and everything from off the sides.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:25.560"> Or something.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:26.380"> And I suppose control the gates.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:29.220"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:29.680"> It opened out opposite the bottom of the Broadway.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:33.100"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:33.920"> The gates are automatic.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:35.440"> It&#039;s all automatic now, you see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:36.880"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:37.280"> Years ago it used to have you be done more or less by hands.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:40.240"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:40.660"> You know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:41.760"> So it&#039;s the most very interesting really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:45.880"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:46.540"> Very interesting, aren&#039;t they, in different things?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:48.860"> I think so.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:49.600"> I think it&#039;s fascinating actually.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:51.380"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:51.420"> It&#039;s very different.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:52.340"> What about fish?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:53.420"> Did you ever get eels in the ream or...?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:57.140"> Oh yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:42:58.200"> Down the bottom of the dry out sluice, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:01.220"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:01.640"> Used to have eels out of there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:03.080"> Did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:03.620"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:04.820"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:05.320"> What, you used to cook them?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:06.380"> Oh yes, I used to love eating them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:08.400"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:08.920"> So how did you catch them and cook them?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:10.620"> Oh you&#039;d catch them, you know, you&#039;d catch them with a...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:15.720"> A rod?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:16.320"> A rod.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:16.900"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:17.280"> And put them on the end of it, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:18.900"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:18.940"> Catch them like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:19.860"> And you&#039;d put them in a bucket then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:21.160"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:21.780"> So as, you know, they&#039;d have fresh water, so you&#039;d kill them and eat them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:27.300"> How long would you...?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:27.780"> I wouldn&#039;t.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:28.900"> He wouldn&#039;t.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:29.780"> Oh no.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:30.680"> But you would keep them in the fresh bucket for a few days, fresh with water?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:33.520"> Oh yes, change the water for a day or two so as they get the...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:37.260"> The earthy stuff.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:38.340"> The earthy stuff.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:39.280"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:39.560"> Otherwise you&#039;d be eating earth.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:41.620"> So you would do that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:42.820"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:43.360"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:44.120"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:44.700"> And then you would skin it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:46.080"> Skin it and then cook it, fry it in the frying pan, chop it up in bits.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:50.220"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:51.020"> But they were very keen.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:52.760"> I mean, I enjoy anything.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:54.480"> Yeah?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:55.380"> Or everything, put it that way.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:56.700"> Yeah?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:57.620"> I&#039;m not...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:58.080"> First, even my food I enjoy a lot.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:43:59.320"> That&#039;s a good free source of food though.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:01.540"> Yeah, it is, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:03.000"> What about Elvis?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:04.240"> Was that something anyone ever had down there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:06.280"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:06.960"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:07.240"> I don&#039;t think so.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:08.560"> No, no.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:09.300"> Down the bottom end of the drive of Boston, you have them down there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:16.920"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:16.960"> And you get them up through the...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:19.600"> You know, up the piers you get them in the...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:22.260"> The Bostons.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:22.800"> Did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:23.500"> Hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:24.080"> Pretty.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:24.320"> Yes, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:25.840"> Crikey.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:26.900"> Oh yes, it&#039;s...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:28.900"> It&#039;s fascinating to read it, you know, when you think back what you&#039;ve seen and done.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:32.640"> What about church?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:33.700"> Did your family ever go to church, you know, when you were down living on...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:37.180"> Yes, I used to go to St. Peter&#039;s Church, which is the big church in the village.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:40.500"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:41.060"> But of course that closed.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:42.900"> And it&#039;s a house now, person.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:46.080"> Is that something the whole family would go to?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:49.220"> Yes, Sunday morning we used to try and go to church on a Sunday evening.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:53.120"> I mean, Father Prosser was a church warden there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:55.460"> Was he?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:55.980"> His father.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:56.580"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:57.080"> Oh yes, he was a big churchman.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:58.600"> Was he?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:44:59.300"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:00.260"> And Mother used to go, Mother Prosser used to go.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:02.220"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:02.620"> And they were on occasion and they were married in Peterstone Church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:09.100"> But of course it closed then, a little while after.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:14.200"> And it&#039;s a house now, people&#039;s got it as a house.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:17.160"> They were living in there, I don&#039;t know, unfortunately the gentleman died now only last year.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:23.960"> His wife and the child are still there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:26.200"> But apparently they were...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:28.160"> I&#039;ve never been in a sense, naturally.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:30.460"> But they were living in pods.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:32.620"> Were they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:33.380"> It&#039;s a big church, man, it&#039;s huge, high, cropped, tremendous height.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:39.120"> Been up the top of the tower, lovely view from there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:41.860"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:43.640"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:44.260"> Would the congregation have been very big?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:48.540"> Well yes, it varied then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:51.280"> You know, it&#039;s like Marshfield is a bigger church, or they do get more congregation there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:45:58.360"> Because I suppose it&#039;s in a bigger village, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:00.300"> And that&#039;s a nice church too, St Mary&#039;s Church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:03.740"> I&#039;ve got a rose tree down there for doing, but I&#039;ve also got a casket up in the field up here.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:09.800"> Have you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:10.300"> Of his ashes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:14.640"> Do you remember any characters that stand out for you that you remember?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:20.000"> Well, before the buildings that are over the other side of the road now, there were buildings, but not like they are now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:26.440"> And there used to be an old fellow living in there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:28.420"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:28.840"> And Dennis his name was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:32.480"> And he used to wear a long, long coat.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:35.960"> He lived in there and there was a grate in the corner, where you&#039;d have a bit of a fireplace if you wanted it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:42.120"> And Dennis, and he&#039;d walk from there then into town, or Romney, and walk back.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:46.980"> I can see him now, it was in the stages ago.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:49.040"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:49.320"> But he had this long, long black coat.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:51.080"> And then there was another one down at the farm down at St Brides.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:46:59.060"> And his name was, he was another character.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:06.520"> I&#039;m trying to think of his name.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:09.600"> He lived in a barn.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:12.660"> I don&#039;t like to use the word tramp, but kind of like just somebody who used to.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:16.540"> Well, they were, yes, they were kind of a tramp type of person, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:22.120"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:22.140"> Billy Mitch, that was down there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:24.060"> That&#039;s right, and Dennis used to be in this one, in our barn over there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:29.220"> No trouble, I mean, you know, actually I think Father Prosser went over there one day and he died in the last time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:38.940"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:39.400"> So he had to get the police and all up his back.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:41.500"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:42.600"> But, no, there were characters about then, weren&#039;t there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:46.400"> Years ago, like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:50.460"> I can see them, I can place them now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:54.360"> It&#039;s gone back a little while.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:56.160"> Yes, Dennis and Billy Mitch used to call him.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:47:59.380"> And they reckoned that if the airplanes were coming over during the war, because that was when he was there during the war,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:07.600"> he&#039;d turn his pipe upside down in cases.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:12.020"> Oh, isn&#039;t that lovely?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:14.000"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:14.580"> It&#039;s a compliment when you think it was a nice thing, because they made a huge pipe.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:19.120"> Oh, right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:21.340"> Oh, Jesus, really funny, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:23.900"> Someone was telling me, now, where was it now?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:28.920"> I can&#039;t remember.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:31.260"> Oh, something about that, was it St. Brides or was it somewhere else?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:36.420"> I might be wrong, but on the Sunday the pubs used to be closed in Wales.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:41.580"> This is when the border was different, so people used to flood over to here to use the pubs on the Sunday.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:46.920"> Is that right?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:48.280"> Maybe I&#039;ve got that wrong.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:52.080"> No, they used to, there was a law, wasn&#039;t there, where the pubs used to close in a lot of places.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:48:59.500"> But I can&#039;t remember where that was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:05.040"> I might have got that wrong, actually.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:08.400"> I feel very sad, really, the six bars was closed.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:11.280"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:14.080"> There was two cottages at the side of that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:19.500"> Was it a popular pub?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:21.280"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:22.620"> We&#039;ve had a lot of lovely times down there, especially Christmas time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:27.120"> We&#039;d go down there and somebody would be playing the organ, have a good old sing-song and that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:32.720"> Oh, I think I&#039;ve got a photograph.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:36.560"> I&#039;m boring you with these photographs.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:37.900"> You are not. I love photographs, Margaret. I really do love photographs.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:46.220"> This is the six bars with all the horses.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:50.460"> No, that&#039;s interesting. I think I might have seen that photograph before.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:54.480"> Have you, maybe?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:57.640"> No, I think.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:49:58.660"> He was no master.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:02.680"> So what hunt, which pack is this?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:04.680"> This would be the, what&#039;s it, Tredegar.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:10.460"> Tredegar?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:11.040"> Tredegar Hunt, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:12.200"> And this is the one you used to follow in your sports car?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:14.500"> Yeah. Yes, that&#039;s right, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:17.840"> Oh, and who&#039;s this?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:20.760"> Do you know where this is taken?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:22.740"> No, I&#039;m not certain of that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:24.480"> Yes, and let&#039;s see, there was two cottages at the side of the six bars.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:28.280"> Oh, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:29.640"> And then this is, what was this, Cairn Filp?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:34.920"> Oh, I don&#039;t know, last year.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:37.240"> Because it looks like it&#039;s been closed for years, doesn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:39.480"> Yes, it does, yes. It looks a bit messed up.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:42.060"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:42.700"> Yes, it&#039;s a shame because we&#039;ve had a lot of fun down there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:46.160"> I just, thinking about St. Melan&#039;s show.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:50.220"> Yes, that&#039;s folded now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:51.200"> That&#039;s folded, but I understand that was a huge event in its time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:54.300"> Yes, yes, it was very good. We had tremendous times with the show.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:50:59.100"> We used to be on the, first of all, St. Melan&#039;s show was to be at Rimley,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:05.460"> on the top of Rimley Hill.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:07.900"> And then it came then to, oh, what&#039;s there now?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:14.260"> Oh, the only one, Cud Curnow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:17.180"> Bakers used to have the farm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:23.180"> Oh, well all these, oh dear, I can&#039;t think of the name.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:29.200"> Oh, that&#039;s silly, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:30.200"> You know, when you go down now towards Newport,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:32.440"> all these buildings on the right-hand side and this left-hand side.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:35.760"> Like a radiator plant and stuff.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:37.380"> That&#039;s right, that&#039;s right, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:38.800"> We used to have the show there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:40.740"> Did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:41.280"> And then we came then to Cairn Mabley here down the bottom of this lane</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:44.000"> where you came over the bridge by the farm park.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:46.840"> We used to have it there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:48.140"> Oh, really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:48.640"> Yes, in the big field there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:50.860"> And, oh yes, and then we went then to Jadika House.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:55.320"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:55.800"> But it was never the same, not really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:51:58.840"> You know, we used to get, I don&#039;t know why it was,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:01.300"> because it was a nice site,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:03.540"> but we didn&#039;t get the agricultural side of things.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:06.520"> Yes, it changed.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:07.680"> It changed altogether.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:09.340"> So where it used to be by Coy Curnow,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:12.340"> what was it, so where that area is now,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:15.200"> it&#039;s completely developed, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:16.700"> Oh yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:17.480"> Was it just farmland then?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:18.800"> It was farmland, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:20.200"> It&#039;s hard to imagine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:21.840"> It is, it is.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:22.920"> So before the motorway and everything, it was...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:26.580"> Yes, well of course they were talking,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:28.060"> they were putting another road up onto the motorway.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:32.120"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:32.720"> I don&#039;t know whether it&#039;s going to happen, I don&#039;t know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:34.260"> But it was just farmland?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:35.640"> Yes, yes, because it was still there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:38.440"> And it was where all the local farmers would go along there,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:41.500"> would they to present, show their livestock?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:45.220"> Yes, oh yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:45.600"> It was a proper agriculture show?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:46.720"> Oh yes, it was, definitely, everything was there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:50.880"> And the local show now is Macken Show.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:54.200"> Okay.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:54.760"> And that&#039;s always on the first Saturday of July.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:56.920"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:57.320"> And that&#039;s a nice little show.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:58.440"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:52:59.100"> And that&#039;s as big as what St. Melan&#039;s was, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:01.760"> But, oh yes, oh yes, we&#039;ve had a lot of fun at the shows.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:06.060"> Yeah, lovely.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:07.600"> But there, things have altered, haven&#039;t they, over the years?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:09.820"> Yeah, they do.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:10.600"> You know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:11.940"> I was just going to ask you about the lighthouse pub.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:14.720"> Is that something that locals would have ever used?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:17.760"> Was it something people from out of town would use?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:21.540"> Have you been down to the lighthouse pub?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:23.180"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:23.660"> Oh, it was very pleasant.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:24.980"> And a lot of people used to walk on the bank, you know, across the bank.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:27.980"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:28.920"> Mm-hmm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:29.540"> But would people walk along from the Cardiff along here?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:32.680"> Yes, well, yes, sort of from Remney perhaps, you know, walk.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:36.540"> And then you would see them go back and that, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:38.240"> Oh, yes, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:39.500"> Oh, it was very pleasant on there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:41.260"> It was a nice day.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:41.980"> Yeah, it is.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:42.740"> It&#039;s nice.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:43.080"> You know, it&#039;s, you go up and you can see both sides.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:47.460"> I&#039;m sure he was telling me that, that people used to stay in almost like a chalet, seat</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:53:55.560"> shack in, in, on the, by the sea wall.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:00.100"> Is that right?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:00.480"> At St. Brides.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:01.380"> At St. Brides?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:02.180"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:02.580"> Or was it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:03.360"> They&#039;ve got caravans there now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:04.980"> I don&#039;t think he meant the caravan, that people would rent out, would come out for the weekend</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:10.100"> and maybe he did mean the caravan actually.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:13.140"> I didn&#039;t think he did mean that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:14.840"> Maybe I got that wrong.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:16.700"> He said people would come out for the day on their bikes and...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:20.480"> Oh, a lot of people used to go to St. Brides.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:23.000"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:23.320"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:24.040"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:25.200"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:25.940"> And of course they&#039;d have these little tent things, wouldn&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:29.160"> Oh, really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:29.920"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:31.080"> You see those, don&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:32.380"> What, like people would camp?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:33.620"> Yes, yes, they&#039;d sleep in there and then, you know...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:37.100"> But along by the wall or...?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:39.280"> Not so much at all, but before they put the caravan site, because there&#039;s a fair bit of</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:44.800"> caravan site at St. Brides apparently, which I haven&#039;t been there for years.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:48.740"> Excuse me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:49.740"> And they used to have these little tent things, you know, you see it on the television, don&#039;t</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:55.080"> they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:55.600"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:56.100"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:57.620"> Oh, I didn&#039;t know that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:54:59.280"> Yes, yes, times have changed, haven&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:02.500"> Yes, they have.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:04.040"> They have.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:05.200"> I just have one thing I have to ask you about, because I was asking about it, because part</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:08.260"> of what I&#039;m doing is talking to people who live along the moors, but that includes people</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:15.060"> from the Gypsy community.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:17.640"> Do you remember any Gypsies coming through?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:22.240"> Well, when we had ground, we had ventured ground on the corner down in Simpra, I think,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:27.920"> down where the Gypsy caravan site is now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:35.760"> There used to be the old...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:37.600"> She was an old Gypsy in the proper old...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:41.420"> Rantel?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:42.080"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:43.200"> And they were there for years on the corner of our field, and we used to have to just</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:47.120"> pass them, you know, to go into the field, and they&#039;d give no trouble at all.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:50.920"> But these are not Gypsies, are they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:52.960"> Not being unkind, they&#039;re travellers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:54.500"> No, I know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:55.320"> Yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:55.860"> You know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:55:56.560"> And I mean, they got horses tethered, and a friend of mine, she saw this little tiny</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:03.480"> pony one day, and she thought the pole was in a hole, sweet.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:07.340"> She came home and took some hay down to give it on the road.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:10.680"> You know, it&#039;s sad.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:12.460"> No, these are travellers more, I think.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:13.880"> You know, they&#039;re not the proper Gypsy, I don&#039;t think.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:19.040"> There we are.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:19.820"> That&#039;s life, I suppose, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:21.200"> It is, I suppose.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:22.720"> And there&#039;s so many of them now, isn&#039;t there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:24.380"> So do you know, you go towards Cardiff and Rumley from where it lives now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:29.440"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:29.500"> I mean, again, when you first arrived, was that just agricultural land?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:34.620"> Oh yes, all just fields.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:37.280"> It&#039;s hard for me to imagine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:39.340"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:40.960"> Yes, and of course there was the KLG, which is a bit firm opposite, isn&#039;t there?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:47.360"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:48.160"> Doing motor things.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:50.240"> But, oh yes, it was all, it&#039;s most unfortunate.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:53.460"> I mean, there&#039;s a little house there as you go down towards the caravan site.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:56:59.020"> On the right-hand side, he was the coalman, Mrs Sadler.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:03.720"> And I look at it now and I think to myself, oh, if he came back and saw us, yeah, he&#039;d be very, very upset about it, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:11.680"> He was the coalman.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:13.500"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:13.900"> So he delivered the coal?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:14.760"> Yes, he delivered the coal.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:15.800"> Yes, he had the bags of coal.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:19.140"> So.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:19.560"> Mrs Sadler.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:20.720"> His son is still alive and he lives in Bramney.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:24.660"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:24.960"> I&#039;ve seen him for some time, actually.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:26.900"> But as the house was, it was a maclet, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:29.920"> But as it is now, the slate&#039;s gone and it&#039;s a mess.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:35.380"> He&#039;d break his heart.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:36.620"> Do you remember a nurse, I&#039;m sure it was Nurse Cox, she was the midwife.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:41.080"> Oh yes, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:43.740"> Now, she lived on the top of Penderland, didn&#039;t she?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:47.100"> That&#039;s right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:47.760"> There were two cottages there and I&#039;m very friendly with Betty Stevens, her name is now, she was Betty Bridge.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:57:56.260"> She lived in there, one of those, and her brother.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:00.700"> And those, what of course, are they gone?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:03.540"> Yes, Nurse Cox.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:05.100"> And there was another nurse, she lived up there too, because Nurse Cox moved down to Castleton.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:09.880"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:10.540"> On the left-hand side, as you go down off the main road.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:15.140"> Oh yes, she used to go around delivering the babies.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:17.380"> Yeah, did she deliver Andrew and your daughter?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:21.180"> No, I went into Glossop.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:23.060"> Oh, did you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:23.800"> Yes, yes, I went into Glossop Tens.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:25.540"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:26.440"> I just said it with both of them, actually.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:29.440"> But, yes, you bring back memories for me as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:34.800"> Oh, well I met her...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:37.520"> Well, I suppose we&#039;ve got hedgerows here, where as down there, there&#039;s the reams.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:41.180"> Ah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:41.980"> You know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:42.440"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:43.700"> But not really, I suppose, no.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:45.960"> No, the grass is green.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:48.020"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:49.600"> And you drove a tractor from Iorlion?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:52.120"> Oh yes, yes, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:58:54.120"> I drove, when we moved from Langhorst down to Berryhill, and Ferguson, Ferguson, 25, excuse me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:03.380"> I did three journeys from Langhorst down to Berryhill, and took me four and a half hours.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:08.620"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:09.160"> With the trailer behind, with implements and stuff, brought them down to Berryhill Farm.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:14.760"> And then when I was going back, do you know the way, do you know Pontypool area, which...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:20.900"> I&#039;ve been to Pontyboil recently.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:23.380"> Pontyboil?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:23.840"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:24.400"> Oh, right, yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:25.120"> Well, when you go, it wasn&#039;t the new road then, because we wouldn&#039;t have been able to go on the new road anyway.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:30.280"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:30.580"> We wouldn&#039;t be able to go on the motorway, you know, with the tractor.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:34.920"> The same then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:36.620"> And I used to go down past the horse and jockey on the bottom, and I used to go down the hill and knock it out of gear,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:42.360"> and go down that hill like the crappers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:44.780"> And I often think, well, what if something came across the road?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:48.720"> I wouldn&#039;t have a chance.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:49.600"> Oh my goodness.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:50.540"> You do things when you&#039;re young, don&#039;t you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:52.160"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:54.440"> Yeah, I did three journeys, that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:59:56.400"> I brought the plough up, and I brought a big trailer up with implements on.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:00.620"> And, yes, it took me four and a half hours.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:03.180"> And were you the only child?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:04.820"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:05.480"> Ah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:05.920"> I haven&#039;t even got a cousin.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:07.800"> Really?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:08.320"> No, because my two aunts didn&#039;t marry.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:10.800"> My one aunt did marry, but she didn&#039;t have any family.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="01:00:13.780"> And then my uncle, he married.</div></div><br>
