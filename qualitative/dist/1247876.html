can bring a positive outcome in someone and you can help them to be loved and be secure</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:35.140"> and comfort.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:37.220"> But you can do that in friendship as well, put it in a different manner.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:44.620"> Love can be either relationship or be a family member or something.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:51.580"> I think it was hard for me when I was younger because I probably didn&#039;t believe it when</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:55.600"> I was younger.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:56.740"> But as you get older you do because you kind of feel more as part of life then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:02.320"> I think you realise that you need someone in your life probably to feel that way.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:09.100"> I thought I felt Lover First Sight probably about a few years ago when I started my college</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:15.560"> because that&#039;s why college was perfect for me because I knew that getting a girlfriend</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:21.620"> half and half.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:23.100"> I had a couple of girlfriends in there but they lived quite far away.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:32.380"> Finding love as well at first sight is hard.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:36.800"> I generally thought Lover First Sight, when I was going through primary school up in the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:50.600"> Maybe seven relationships in total but the one that I don&#039;t think you met or you might</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:58.000"> have was Jess.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:00.140"> Yes, that was a couple of years ago.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:01.800"> That&#039;s when I was living with her for seven months.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:04.160"> That&#039;s when I generally thought it was Lover First Sight.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:07.860"> As we&#039;ve said, it&#039;s hard when you&#039;re happy and something bad happens to you that you</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:12.480"> think, am I doing anything right or wrong?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:14.580"> I know and they won&#039;t even tell you.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:21.820"> I&#039;m lucky with mine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:25.480"> When I seen Kimmy in Pondy bus station back in January 2017, I looked at her but she kind</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:33.360"> of looked down because I think she probably felt the same, Lover First Sight.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:37.480"> We kind of knew there was something there so I think that&#039;s why we&#039;re still together now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:41.280"> I think my first reaction was, and they call it puppy love.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:48.440"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:50.580"> I think some of those people are lucky when you have someone you love and you see them</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:59.620"> first.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:02.740"> That&#039;s definitely the girl.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:09.920"> Sometimes part of life you might not be lucky, you might be just positive and say, go for</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:14.880"> it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:15.280"> If not, it don&#039;t work out.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:16.580"> There&#039;s plenty more fish in the sea as they say.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:23.440"> Love is not a very powerful source for yourality.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:28.220"> I think it&#039;s hard for you because of who you are to believe it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:41.360"> Believe it is.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:43.280"> I thought at one point I grasped it and then out of the blue I was just like, nah, I haven&#039;t</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:51.400"> grasped it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:52.080"> Still got to do a few tweaks year and May.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:56.120"> I have been doing those tweaks but it just doesn&#039;t work as much as it was without the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:04.520"> tweaks.</div></div><br>
