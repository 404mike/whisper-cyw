Where and when were you born? Swansea in 1932. How did you meet Father Paul Satori?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:26.660"> I received a letter in 1979 from a friend of my Aunt Nell&#039;s. I took it to work because I didn&#039;t have time to open it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:41.360"> When I read the letter I was shocked and upset as Frances was because she assumed that I had known about my Aunt Nell dying and being buried.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:55.220"> And the fact that Aunt Nell was a very staunch Catholic and the fact that she had just been buried without the Eucharist, the Requiem Mass, that upset us very much, both of us.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:13.080"> So the person I spoke with at work was a Catholic and attended the church in Haverford West.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:22.220"> So she took me down in our break to seek Father Saulte Tauri.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:29.040"> So I showed him the letter and I did explain to him that I was now a lapsed Catholic.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:37.900"> There was no sense, he wasn&#039;t judgmental at all, he didn&#039;t, you know, he didn&#039;t criticize or anything.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:45.240"> He was very, very sympathetic, very, very kind.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:50.680"> And he said, I&#039;ll do my best to find out what happened.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:56.140"> And I&#039;ll speak with you in a few days time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:00.300"> Which he did.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:01.580"> He actually rang his brother in Swansea, who was also a priest.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:07.180"> And he got the information from him.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:10.260"> And then when he rang me again, he said that because I was a lapsed Catholic, I was no longer a Catholic, he wasn&#039;t allowed to give me a service in the church.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:24.860"> But he arranged for me to go to the little convent in Haverford West.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:29.080"> And the mother superior there conducted the service.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:33.880"> And it was lovely.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:36.300"> You know, and it, it, what did it do?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:40.760"> It made me, gave me the courage to say goodbye to my auntie Nell, who I loved dearly.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:49.440"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:51.700"> So was that your earliest memory of Father Paul Saulte Tauri?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:55.720"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:57.120"> Did you ever meet him afterwards?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:00.160"> No, unfortunately.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:01.720"> How would you describe him as a person?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:03.500"> I know if you only met him the once, but what did he, what did he come across as?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:07.860"> He came across as a, as a very kind, outgoing person.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:13.200"> And I would think, I don&#039;t know, that he would have had a lovely sense of humour.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:23.560"> Can you think of, do you have any other stories of Father Saulte Tauri or did you have any other connection with him?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:29.720"> Was it just that one incident?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:31.080"> That was just, that was, that one incident.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:35.720"> That&#039;s, that&#039;s when he, the hospice was founded, I made a, I make a donation.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:44.140"> I&#039;ve got a direct debit and I make a monthly donation to the foundation.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:49.720"> I feel that&#039;s, that&#039;s all I can do to say thank you to him.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:54.680"> That&#039;s marvellous.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:55.720"> That&#039;s the plan, that&#039;s excellent news.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:55.940"> I think that&#039;s kinda what happens you&#039;re really short Ã©taient and told her to me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:56.280"> thousands of, you know, I&#039;m not alone, it is just my time I&#039;m, it came across</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:58.500"> the model
