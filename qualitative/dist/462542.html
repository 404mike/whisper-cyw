            <div class="transcript_container"><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:00.000"> I suppose I watched, I think when I was in the sixth form,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:03.220"> we did watch television in the evening a little bit more</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:06.760"> because I didn&#039;t have the, I didn&#039;t do the amount of subjects then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:11.180"> Things eased off in the sixth form.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:15.540"> But my viewing pattern, I think, well, see, I&#039;ve moved about a bit.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:23.180"> Now, when I went to college, we did have a television in the common room,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:26.720"> but we didn&#039;t watch much television there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:28.440"> I don&#039;t remember much about television in college.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:32.840"> And then when I went to work in Liverpool, we did hire a television set,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:38.920"> you know, on, what do you call it, what do you call it, on hire purchase.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:46.060"> DER it was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:47.860"> And, do you know, there were four of us in the first year working there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:54.280"> And this girl, no, when we went to the shop,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:58.200"> the manager said,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:58.420"> the man said to us, you know, we asked him about that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:02.000"> And then when he realised we wanted to have a television,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:06.320"> he wouldn&#039;t sell it, he wouldn&#039;t let us have it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:09.500"> And I said, why?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:10.840"> He said, you&#039;re too young.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:12.420"> I said, we&#039;re teachers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:14.400"> And he didn&#039;t believe me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:16.860"> They wouldn&#039;t sell us.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:18.200"> And, do you know, I also had somebody who wouldn&#039;t sell me the news of the world either.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:21.800"> They said, you&#039;re too young.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:23.620"> This woman had, the papers weren&#039;t on the counter, they were at the back.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:27.340"> And this old woman, she was a teacher.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:28.400"> And this old lady wouldn&#039;t let me have the news of the world.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:32.200"> We must have looked young.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:34.140"> We must have done.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:37.080"> Oh, dear me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:38.380"> I wish that happened now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:39.780"> Anyway, the thing was,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:42.700"> so yes, we had this,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:44.040"> eventually we did have a television from another shop, DER it was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:48.360"> But I don&#039;t know that we watched a lot of television.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:50.800"> I don&#039;t recall watching programmes much on it,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:54.160"> except the news maybe.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:58.640"> I remember on one occasion, there was something about the pill,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:03.100"> which was quite controversial at the time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:05.320"> I don&#039;t remember watching anything much.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:07.920"> I can&#039;t remember the programme, or Coronation Street,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:10.500"> because my friend was, oh, she&#039;s been faithfully watching Coronation Street for years.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:15.100"> And so we did watch that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:18.040"> But, I suppose we went out more in those days.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:22.320"> When you&#039;re younger, you go out more, don&#039;t you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:24.440"> And I was very much in with a Welsh group in Liverpool then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:28.500"> And then I went to London, and we had,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:34.220"> we didn&#039;t have a television there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:39.780"> But I was only there a term anyway.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:42.140"> And then I came back to the Wirral,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:44.740"> and yes, I did have a television, but not immediately.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:48.860"> I did go out more in the beginning.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:50.780"> But then I had my own flat, and I had a television there,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:53.960"> which was black and white.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:56.100"> Most people had black and white then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:58.400"> And I think I watched Coronation Street.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:01.500"> I&#039;ve always liked Coronation Street.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:03.220"> Don&#039;t watch any other soap.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:04.780"> And the news as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:11.320"> So I&#039;ve always been clued up to the news, really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:14.200"> And I used to watch the Gulf,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:16.560"> and a horror film on a Monday night.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:20.000"> Not that I like horror films now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:25.100"> And sports. I love sports.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:27.240"> I like watching.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:28.400"> Rugby.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:29.500"> I like watching Formula One.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:33.620"> And tennis.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:34.820"> I watched tennis there, and we used to discuss the games at school as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:39.620"> Because in those days, Wimbledon started about two o&#039;clock, was it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:43.920"> Or, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:45.120"> So we finished work at three o&#039;clock.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:48.200"> So we&#039;d be rushing home at that time,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:50.100"> because things were easing off then with summer term.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:52.040"> It was nearly holiday time, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:54.380"> And so to watch the matches.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:56.680"> It was at the time when Chris Everett was in.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:58.380"> And he was in a heyday, and people like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:01.200"> And...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:03.820"> Wait a minute.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:04.800"> Yes, I remember watching those.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:06.500"> I think, I suppose, really, I watched more television when I had my own flat.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:11.740"> I know at home, my father used to like wrestling on a Saturday afternoon,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:17.180"> which I didn&#039;t.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:17.960"> So I didn&#039;t watch that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:23.380"> Yeah, I think, I suppose, I was more aware of television.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:28.380"> In the 60s, 70s.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:35.360"> And I&#039;ve always been a selective viewer.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:42.620"> But I do like certain things, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:45.580"> And I like, I love historical drama, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:52.520"> Like the, oh, and things like Silk.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:56.280"> And another one I loved.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:58.720"> Well, this was, I was still at school then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:01.780"> They used to have a program called No Hiding Place.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:05.500"> It was a detective thing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:07.240"> But it was lovely, a lovely program.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:09.180"> On a Sunday night, I think it was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:11.180"> I think it was a Sunday night.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:13.580"> And they had quite nice music to introduce it as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:18.240"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:19.980"> And then in later years, I watched Van der Valk.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:22.920"> Do you remember that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:23.900"> I&#039;m probably talking about things you don&#039;t know about.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:25.740"> Van der Valk.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:26.500"> That was another television program based in Holland.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:29.640"> And that was very iconic music.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:32.100"> Have you ever heard of that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:33.760"> Yes, that&#039;s it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:35.060"> And, oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:39.360"> Yes, there&#039;s been some, I love documentaries if they&#039;re, you know, if they interest me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:44.260"> And of course in later, well, I&#039;m sorry now that Learning Zone is on in the middle of the night.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:49.680"> Although I&#039;m late, you know, I&#039;m late up.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:52.140"> But it&#039;s just too late.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:53.000"> It&#039;s four o&#039;clock or something.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:54.180"> But they used to be, it used to be on about midnight.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:56.500"> At one time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:57.160"> And I used to love watching some of that because it&#039;s quite educational.</div></div><br>

one I loved, well, this was, I was still at school then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:01.960"> They used to have a programme called No Hiding Place.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:05.540"> It was a detective thing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:07.440"> But it was lovely, lovely programme on a Sunday night, I think it was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:10.960"> I think it was a Sunday night.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:13.680"> And they had quite nice music to introduce it as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:18.360"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:20.060"> And then in later years, I watched Van der Valk.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:23.220"> Do you remember that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:24.020"> I&#039;m probably talking about things you don&#039;t know about.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:25.900"> Van der Valk, that was another television programme based in Holland.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:29.720"> And that was a very iconic music.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:32.300"> Have you ever heard of that?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:33.820"> Yes, that&#039;s it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:35.160"> And, oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:39.420"> Yes, there have been some, I love documentaries if they&#039;re, you know, if they interest me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:44.380"> And, of course, in later, well, I&#039;m sorry now that Learning Zone is on in the middle of the night.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:49.760"> Although I&#039;m late, you know, I&#039;m late up and it&#039;s too late, it&#039;s four o&#039;clock or something.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:54.380"> But they used to be, it used to be on about midnight at one time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:57.360"> And I used to love watching some of that because it&#039;s quite educational.</div></div><br>

            <div class="transcript_container"><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:00.000"> I suppose I watched, I think when I was in the sixth form we did watch television in</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:04.780"> the evening a little bit more because I didn&#039;t have the, I didn&#039;t do the amount of subjects</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:10.920"> then, things eased off in the sixth form. But my viewing pattern, I think, well you</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:21.900"> see I&#039;ve moved about a bit. Now when I went to college we did have a television in the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:29.980"> college. And then when I went to work in Liverpool we did hire a television set, you know, on,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:40.260"> what do you call it, on higher purchase, a DER it was, and do you know there were four</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:50.300"> of us in the first year working there. And this girl, no when we went to the shop the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:58.520"> man said to us, I know we asked him about that, and then when he realised we wanted</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:04.340"> to have a television he wouldn&#039;t sell it, he wouldn&#039;t let us have it, and I said why?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:11.300"> He said you&#039;re too young. I said we&#039;re teachers. And he didn&#039;t believe me. They wouldn&#039;t sell</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:18.040"> us. And do you know I also had somebody who wouldn&#039;t sell me the news of the world either.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:22.200"> They said you&#039;re too young. This woman had, the papers weren&#039;t on the counter, they were</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:26.300"> at the back. And this old lady wouldn&#039;t let me have the news of the world. That we must</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:33.040"> have looked young. We must have done. Oh dear me. I wish that had happened now. Anyway,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:40.620"> the thing was, so yes we had this, eventually we did have a television from another shop,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:47.080"> DER it was, but I don&#039;t know that we watched a lot of television. I don&#039;t recall watching</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:52.500"> programmes much on it except the news maybe. I remember on one occasion there was something</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:02.400"> about the pill which was quite controversial at the time. I don&#039;t remember watching anything</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:07.440"> much. I can&#039;t remember a programme, or coronation treat because my friend was, oh she&#039;s been</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:12.740"> faithfully watching coronation treat for years. And so we did watch that. But I suppose we</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:21.180"> went out more in those days. When you&#039;re younger you go out more don&#039;t you? And I was very</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:25.420"> much in with a Welsh group in Liverpool then. And then I went to London and we had, we didn&#039;t</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:35.200"> have a television there. But I was only there a term anyway. And then I came back to the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:43.840"> Wirral and yes I did have a television but not immediately. I did go out more in the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:50.600"> beginning. But then I had my own flat and I had a television there which was black</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:55.100"> and white. Most people had black and white then. And I think I watched coronation treat,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:01.820"> I&#039;ve always liked coronation treat, don&#039;t watch any other soap. And the news as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:11.660"> So I&#039;ve always been clued up to the news really. And I used to watch the golf and a horror</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:17.620"> film on a Monday night. Not that I like horror films now. And sports, I love sports. I like</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:27.920"> watching rugby. I like watching Formula One and tennis. I watched tennis there and we</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:36.700"> used to discuss the games at school as well. Because in those days Wimbledon started about</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:42.820"> 2 o&#039;clock was it? Yes so we finished work at 3 o&#039;clock so we used to be rushing home</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:49.560"> at that time because things were easing off then with summer term. It was nearly holiday</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:53.420"> time wasn&#039;t it? And so to watch the matches. It was at the time when Chris Evert was in</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:58.620"> a hay day and people like that. And, wait a minute, yes I remember watching those, I</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:07.020"> think I suppose really I watched more television when I had my own flat. I know at home my</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:14.200"> father used to like wrestling on a Saturday afternoon which I didn&#039;t so I didn&#039;t watch</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:19.480"> that. Yes I suppose I was more aware of television in the 60s, 70s. And I&#039;ve always been a fan</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:37.020"> of TV. I&#039;m a selective viewer but I do like certain things. I love historical drama and</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:55.580"> things like silk. And another one I loved, well this was, I was still at school then,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:01.860"> they used to have a program called No Hiding Place. It was a detective thing but it was</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:07.920"> lovely, a lovely program on a Sunday night I think it was. I think it was a Sunday night.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:13.880"> And they had quite nice music to introduce it as well. Yes. And then in later years I</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:21.800"> watched Van der Valk. Do you remember that? I&#039;m probably talking about things you don&#039;t</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:25.280"> know about. Van der Valk that was another television program based in Holland. And that</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:30.420"> was very iconic music. Have you ever heard of that? Yes that&#039;s it. And yes there have</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:40.260"> been some, I love documentaries if they interest me. And of course in later, well I&#039;m sorry</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:47.140"> now that Learning Zone is on in the middle of the night. Although I&#039;m late, I&#039;m late</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:52.040"> up and it&#039;s too late, it&#039;s four o&#039;clock or something. But it used to be on about midnight</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:56.600"> at one time and I used to love watching some of that because it&#039;s quite educational.</div></div><br>
