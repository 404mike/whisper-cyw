            <div class="transcript_container"><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:00.000"> I&#039;m Vicki MacDonald and I&#039;m at Holy Trinity Church, Llandudno, during the longest yarn.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:05.780"> And I&#039;m speaking to Wendy Lonsdale, who has memories of her parents during the war.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:11.760"> Wendy, what do you want to tell me?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:14.180"> Well, I was born in 1941, so I was always called a war baby.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:20.020"> My mother used to, we lived actually in Port Hague, and we had an antique business in Port Maddock.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:32.300"> So when the phony war came, my mother panicked and thought that the Germans were going to land on Black Rock Sands.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:42.600"> And so she started taking all her valuable antiques down into the cellar until, I think,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:49.760"> my father...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:50.020"> My father told her not to be so silly.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:52.860"> So that was the first story that I can recall.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:57.400"> And I do remember that my father was in the Home Guard in the first few years of the war.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:03.120"> And he was stationed up below Snowdon, near Capel Kirig, guarding the line, the pipeline, which was water.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:18.680"> I gather it was a...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:20.000"> The water.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:20.580"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:21.480"> But I didn&#039;t hear very much about that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:25.180"> And then at the beginning of the war, anybody who had a house with a spare bedroom was told they had to take members of the services,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:36.160"> or they had to have somebody to live with them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:42.920"> So my mother decided, or evacuees.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:45.360"> So my mother said, oh, well, we&#039;ve got the premises above the shop.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:50.000"> We&#039;ll go down to the shop and live over the shop in Port Maddock.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:55.080"> And we&#039;ll let a family come and live in our house in Borthagest.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:00.840"> And I&#039;m not quite sure how long we were there, but I was born over the shop.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:06.180"> And I remember my mother saying to her mother, well, I don&#039;t remember this, but she told me this,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:13.380"> that, oh, I can&#039;t possibly have a baby over the shop.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:16.600"> And my grandmother apparently said, you&#039;d be surprised.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:19.660"> I swear you can have a baby.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:23.120"> So during the war, obviously, I was a baby.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:27.180"> And my mother took me on the...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:30.940"> I think we must have had a...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:33.100"> We went by taxi, I think, to Liverpool, because that&#039;s where her mother and father lived in Liverpool,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:39.900"> but not in Liverpool itself, out in Great Crosby.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:44.280"> And my grandmother apparently used to say, they&#039;d telephone and say,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:48.800"> do you think it&#039;s safe?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:49.660"> Do you think it&#039;s safe to come?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:50.560"> And my grandmother said, well, there haven&#039;t been any bombs recently.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:54.680"> I think you&#039;re safe to come.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:56.240"> So then apparently I was taken as a baby in arms up to Liverpool.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:02.580"> And as soon as we got there, the bombs started dropping.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:06.140"> And nearly the end of the war, my father had then been called up because he was older.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:12.620"> He was called up and he was in the Royal Corps of Signals and doing, learning how to do,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:19.660"> you know, codes and things like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:21.660"> And he was...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:22.760"> I remember he was in Scarborough.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:25.500"> And for some reason, we went to stay in Scarborough.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:28.720"> We went on the train.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:29.940"> And I can remember going on the train and all the soldiers on the train sort of making a big fuss of me</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:38.560"> because I was a, you know, little girl.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:40.620"> And we got to Scarborough and stayed there a few days, I suppose.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:46.360"> Those are my earliest memories.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:48.680"> Thank you.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:49.220"> And you told me one memory about your mother and the knives.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:52.340"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:53.060"> So because it was an antique shop, she had a lot of, well, knives,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:58.180"> very, obviously, very dangerous knives from the Far East.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:02.300"> And there were Dutch commandos stationed, I think, near Harlech.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:08.720"> And they came into the shop and wanted to know if she had any sharp knives</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:17.260"> because we&#039;ll get these.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:19.220"> And so and so.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:20.060"> They were going out to the Far East.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:22.320"> They were being...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:23.120"> They were stationed.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:24.180"> She sold them, the knives?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:25.240"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:25.720"> Yeah.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:26.000"> She sold whatever she had.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:28.860"> She was glad to get rid of them, I think.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:33.300"> What else was...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:34.200"> So you had...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:35.920"> Your mother had quite a busy wartime.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:38.800"> There were other memories?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:40.320"> And the other...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:41.160"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:41.340"> Well, so then talking about the being...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:44.020"> Because I was born in...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:46.500"> Over the shop, as it were.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:48.140"> The house...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:49.220"> Was...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:49.720"> She obviously...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:51.100"> Sorry, I stopped the tape for a moment.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:53.920"> Wendy&#039;s going to continue.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:55.460"> Just to say that a family came from London and lived in our house during the war.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:03.240"> It was a vacu-ease.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:04.340"> Well, I suppose you&#039;d call them a vacu-ease, but yes, it was a family.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:09.100"> It was instead of having soldiers, I suppose,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:11.640"> because otherwise we&#039;d have had soldiers living in it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:15.000"> And it was a very nice bungalow in Forth a Guest.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:20.640"> So thank you, Wendy.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:22.040"> Thank you for your wonderful memories of the war and your mother&#039;s war as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:27.640"> So did your...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:28.840"> She survived it all and...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:30.660"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:31.100"> The antique shop stayed open after the war, did she?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:33.920"> Indeed, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:34.480"> She did.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:34.780"> Until 1950s.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:36.000"> Of course.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:36.680"> 1950s, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:37.180"> Oh, that was lovely.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:38.360"> Thank you so much.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:39.240"> Thank you for doing that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:40.680"> Thank you.</div></div><br>

data-time="00:01:22.120"> But I didn&#039;t hear very much about that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:25.680"> And then at the beginning of the war, anybody who had a house with a spare bedroom</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:31.980"> was told they had to take members of the services, or they had to have somebody to live with them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:43.340"> So my mother decided, or evacuated, so my mother said,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:46.560"> oh, well, we&#039;ve got premises above the shop, we&#039;ll go down to the shop and live over the shop in Port-Madoc,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:55.440"> and we&#039;ll let a family come and live in our house in Port-au-Guest.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:01.160"> And I&#039;m not quite sure how long we were there, but I was born over the shop.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:06.640"> And I remember my mother saying to her mother,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:09.060"> well, I don&#039;t remember it, but she told me this,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:13.460"> that, oh, I can&#039;t possibly have a baby over the shop.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:17.100"> And my grandmother apparently said, you&#039;d be surprised where you can have a baby.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:23.820"> So during the war, obviously, I was a baby, and my mother took me on the,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:30.960"> I think we must have had a, we went by taxi, I think, to Liverpool,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:36.160"> because that&#039;s where her mother and father lived in Liverpool,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:40.540"> but not in Liverpool itself, out in Great Crosby.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:45.000"> And my grandmother apparently used to say, they&#039;d telephone and say, do you think it&#039;s safe to come?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:50.860"> And my grandmother said, well, there haven&#039;t been any bombs recently.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:55.060"> I think you&#039;re safe to come.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:56.660"> So then apparently we were, I was taken as a baby in arms up to Liverpool,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:02.740"> and as soon as we got there, the bombs started dropping.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:06.300"> And at nearly the end of the war, my father had then been called up because he was older.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:13.000"> He was called up and he was in the Royal Corps of Signals,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:17.700"> and doing, learning how to do codes and things like that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:22.100"> And he was, I remember he was in Scarborough.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:25.860"> And for some reason, we went to stay in Scarborough.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:28.840"> We went on the train.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:30.020"> And I can remember going on the train and all the soldiers on the train,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:36.880"> sort of making a big fuss of me because I was a little girl.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:41.020"> And we got to Scarborough and stayed there a few days, I suppose.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:46.740"> Those are my earliest memories.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:49.140"> And you told me one memory about your mother and the knives.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:52.720"> Yes. So because it was an antique shop, she had a lot of, well, knives,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:58.220"> very obviously, very dangerous knives from the Far East.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:03.420"> And there were Dutch commandos stationed, I think near Harlech.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:09.300"> And they came into the shop and wanted to know if she had any sharp knives,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:17.420"> because we&#039;ll get the so-and-so&#039;s.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:20.480"> They were going out to the Far East. They were stationed.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:24.200"> Did she sell them, the knives?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:25.240"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:25.840"> Yes, she sold whatever she had.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:29.260"> She was glad to get rid of them, I think.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:35.460"> So your mother had quite a busy wartime.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:39.300"> There were other memories?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:40.920"> Yes. Well, so then talking about the being,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:44.520"> because I was born over the shop, as it were, the house was...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:51.300"> Sorry, I stopped the tape for a moment. Wendy&#039;s going to continue.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:55.960"> Just to say that a family came from London and lived in our house during the war.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:04.540"> Well, I suppose you&#039;d call them evacuees, but yes, it was a family.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:09.480"> It was instead of having soldiers, I suppose,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:11.940"> because otherwise we&#039;d have had soldiers living in it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:15.460"> And it was a very nice bungalow in Borthogest.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:20.800"> So thank you, Wendy.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:22.200"> Thank you for your wonderful memories of the war and your mother&#039;s war as well.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:28.020"> So did she survive it all and the antique shop stayed open after the war?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:33.980"> Indeed, yes, until 1950s.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:37.520"> Oh, that was lovely. Thank you so much. Thank you for doing that.</div></div><br>
