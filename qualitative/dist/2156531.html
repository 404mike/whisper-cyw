            <h2>A</h2>
            <div class="transcript_container"><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:06.100"> Yes, we&#039;re ready to go now. Today is Friday the 23rd of September. My name is Jill Willie</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:14.820"> and I&#039;m at Habit Hardware talking to Mr John Jones, who has lived in this area all his</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:22.700"> life. John, thank you very much for agreeing to have a chat with me. First of all, could</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:28.820"> you just start with your year of birth, John, please? I was born on the 2nd of February,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:34.800"> 1948. And can you tell me where you were born? I was born in a bedroom at Upper Llandfadog.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:43.820"> Llandfadog. Can you tell me exactly where Upper Llandfadog or Llandfadog, Llandfadog</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:48.820"> is then, John? Well, as you go from Raider up the Ellen Valley, you go past the Ellen</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:55.900"> Valley Hotel and it&#039;s the next farm on your right about 300 yards away. Thank you. And</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:03.980"> what sort of facilities do you remember as you were growing up? Things like running water</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:10.000"> and etc. Can you give me some details of that sort of thing? Well, we had no electricity.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:17.180"> The toilet was outside about 50 yards away and the water we had from the spout and my mother</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:27.260"> did all the washing and that out there and by the brook and bathing was a tin bath brought into the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:38.940"> kitchen, perhaps twice a week, sometimes only once a week. And no electricity so we had these</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:48.780"> paraffin lamps that you had to pump up all the time when the pressure dropped.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:57.320"> I see. And how much work did you yourself do around the farm, John, as a young boy growing up?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:05.360"> Um, I did quite a bit. When I attended Ellen Village School, I used to milk a cow every morning</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:14.680"> by hand because we sold milk around the Elan Village and that was my contribution. I milked</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:22.140"> this one cow who was my favourite, perched on a little stool and then I walked to the school</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:29.820"> afterwards. And you actually got your water from where exactly, John? Well, between the house and</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:39.140"> building at Llanfadog, there was a brook coming down and we had a spout and a little pool there</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:46.460"> and that is where the water came from. But when I was about 10, we had it piped about 500 yards</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:54.420"> from another well out in the field and that was wonderful spring water and the only time</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:01.460"> I saw that goat rye was in the hot summer of 1976. Indeed. And were your family born at</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:13.320"> and grew up in Llanfadog, Upper? My father was born there and my mother was born at the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:22.880"> Llanfadog. Now, we were a large family, John, in Llanfadog? Yes, we were. I was the fourth,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:32.580"> but there was a baby loss between me and the sister above me. So we were five really.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:40.180"> And so there was five of us, but I was born a long time after. My two older sisters was 22 and 20</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:53.360"> when I was born and two of my three sisters were married with children. So I have nephews and nieces</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:01.520"> older than myself. That&#039;s quite unusual, but of course it does happen.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:09.500"> What sort of major events can you remember in the Allen Valley as you were growing up, John?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:16.380"> Well, I suppose the first one was when the Queen came with the ducal hellenbrough in October 1952.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:24.440"> I would have been four-year-old and I just remember standing outside the hotel over on where the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:32.920"> bicycle path is now with our flags and my sister Joan was a waitress in the Allen Valley and she</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:40.740"> waited on the Queen. Oh, what an accolade, my word. And what places did you have to play in and to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:51.300"> generally just explore in your Allen Valley area? On the farm, you had plenty of places,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:57.780"> you had fields all around you, but I think me and my nephews enjoyed going down the brook to where</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:04.440"> it meets the River Allen and we were catching minnows there until I was old enough to have a</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:11.680"> rod and line and I loved fishing in those days. Quite a lot of that goes on at the Allen Valley,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:18.260"> doesn&#039;t it? Right, now what memories do you have of the big shearings that took place in the Allen</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:25.800"> Valley, John? Oh, well, it was the highlight of the year. You swap men with neighbouring farms,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:35.340"> so you know there might be 30 men would come to your shearing and it was the day of the year.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:44.420"> And you started off with breakfast and then you had lunch and tea and hopefully you finished</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:51.040"> about five o&#039;clock. And we had one hill which was up above the Clarewyn Dam, so them sheep had to be</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:59.700"> driven down on a two-day drive sort of thing to share at Uppel and Vadog and then that night they</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:06.560"> were taken back up to the hen run and they went on from there back to the hill next day.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:14.060"> And shearing was a wonderful thing. As a boy, the highlight was after dinner we&#039;d have a game of</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:21.780"> football with all the younger men. But what I remember, there were four or five old men</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:29.880"> sat outside the barn on a bench all day and all they were sitting down and talking</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:37.600"> about tales and they seemed very old to me. But when I think back, they were probably only in their</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:44.240"> late 60s, you know, but the way they dressed and that I thought they were a hundred.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:51.660"> But I&#039;m sure they had lots of interesting memories to share, yes. So would you say that despite the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:58.320"> rural locality you had plenty to do and a very good social life, you knew everyone?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:03.920"> Oh yes, I knew everyone and as I&#039;d got two nephews living behind the Ellen Valley Hotel,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:13.280"> the three of us sort of played together most nights and played football in the field at</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:19.880"> Llanwadog and later on when the Birmingham City police cadets came to Ellen Village,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:27.740"> they had goal posts put up on the green, so we used to go up there to play football</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:32.880"> and I&#039;ve seen us cycle down to Llanowethal to play Boys of Llanowethal and</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:40.700"> well everywhere we went we cycled and I was a founder member of Raider Young Farmers and that</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:50.020"> started in 1963 and still we were old enough to drive, we went there on a push bike which was</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:59.080"> up in Bryn Tyrian and they held the meetings. And Bryn Tyrian I understand is the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:06.220"> then secondary school of the area, is that correct? Yes it was. The only time I ever</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:12.420"> attended Bryn Tyrian was to try my 11 plus. Right, we&#039;ll come on to that now then, on to school life.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:24.680"> Can you tell me where you went to school and what age you were when you started John?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:31.380"> I went to Ellen Village Primary School at Easter 1953.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:40.500"> My birthday was February so I&#039;d just gone five and my sister Joan took me to school the first morning</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:48.380"> and all the other pupils were stood in the entrance I think waiting the newcomer and</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:57.440"> I was there till 1959 and I had many a happy time looking back in the Valley School.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:05.940"> We were never more than 20 pupils and I think when I left they were down to 12</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:13.720"> and there was two teachers there. The first teacher was Mrs. Jim Price or Mrs. Betty Price</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:20.980"> and the senior teacher was Miss Chu.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:26.980"> I have heard those names. Could I add one more thing? Please. The only thing I hated about the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:40.300"> Lord Mayor of Birmingham came down and we had the June tea and of course the tea was nice.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:47.320"> I loved that but afterwards we had to perform on stage and every year they seemed to have me to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:53.760"> sing a solo and after that the Lady Mayoress presented us all with a book for what we&#039;d done</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:01.120"> during the year. If you&#039;d done well you had the best books.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:07.640"> Right and am I right in thinking that the school at the Ellen Village was where the lodge is now?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:16.440"> Yes it was. There was a school immediately above it when the works were going on but this new</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:26.080"> school was built in 1909 and my mother went to the old school just above it but my father</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:35.580"> was not allowed to go to that school because he was living in the Radnyshire side and he had to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:43.940"> walk three miles to come tie the school every day. So you yourself went to the Ellen Village</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:52.280"> school but you were still in what was then Radnyshire weren&#039;t you? So were there many other</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:59.280"> children from Radnyshire in that school? No I think at the time I left there was just two of us.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:07.980"> The other boy didn&#039;t try the 11 plus so he went straight to Brinturion. There was three the same</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:15.360"> age as me living on the Breckinshire side so they went to Bilth High School and they didn&#039;t have to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:23.360"> 11 plus. I was the only one out of the five of us that had to try the 11 plus. And was that</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:30.460"> because Radnyshire and Breckinshire being different authorities had decided different rules regarding</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:36.680"> the 11 plus? Yes it has. I mean it&#039;s different now you can go to any school but in them days</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:44.260"> it was Radnyshire and Breckinshire and I only lived 200 yards from the river Ellen and if I&#039;d</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:51.440"> been the other side I&#039;d have been in Breckinshire. And would not have had to take the 11 plus I see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:58.640"> Now having taken the 11 plus what school did you then go to John? I went to Landerinder Grammar</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:04.820"> School in the first week of September 1959 when a school car driven by Mr. Harold Ashton from the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:14.920"> opposite Jimmy Lloyd&#039;s yard drove me down to the bus and then we met the bus up by the Smithfield</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:24.240"> in Radar and there was a boys bus and a girls bus. And how long were you at that school traveling</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:32.400"> to and from then John? Well I left in 1963 because I&#039;d had a couple of run-ins with Mr. Howell&#039;s</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:43.680"> headmaster and he said that I had to try my own levels and I said I&#039;ll show you and I left.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:54.060"> If you left right. John you must have seen quite a lot of changes in the valley. Would you like to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:03.340"> talk a little bit about the development of the valley as you know it? Well I&#039;ve seen lots of</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:09.940"> changes not for the better in my opinion. I you know although I&#039;m a proud Welshman,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:18.760"> Birmingham were very good landlords and they were good to the farmers and they would provide new</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:25.160"> gates and hurdles and fencing material every year and then when it changed over to Welsh water</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:32.000"> it was a downward spiral and I think the valley was much better in those days, much tidier.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:43.600"> You could fish from the Cabin Dam to Garry Dee. That railway line had two or three sheep in it and</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:49.880"> it kept all the foliage down. Now it&#039;s just like a jungle and you can&#039;t fish one yard of it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:58.320"> Very very unfortunate because fishing is really quite a prominent activity in our area isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:06.260"> Yes. Speaking about the livestock now, how often did you actually come into Raerdy to the market</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:12.900"> or to any other market? Well I don&#039;t remember coming much. My father you know would bring</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:20.120"> a cow or cow and calf or something occasionally to the mart and we&#039;d always sell our sail ews</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:28.520"> in the autumn and we drove them down with two dogs and I sometimes walked in front and my father</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:37.940"> behind and we never lost one. We always got them to the market and tied the dogs up there all day</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:45.560"> and sold and one year the prices were poor so we didn&#039;t sell. I was about 16 at the time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:57.580"> Anyway my father was getting on then and a car stopped when we were driving these sheep home</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:04.400"> and he offered father a lift home and he said I&#039;ll leave my dog with you and soon as father got in</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:12.300"> a car the dog went back towards Raerdy and unfortunately he got killed by a car and I</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:21.380"> got the sheep home with my dog and then my sister Joan went back to Raerdy in the van to look for</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:29.100"> this dog and found him dead on the road and brought him back. That was a sad day. How unfortunate.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:36.760"> And we took the sheep to the next fair and didn&#039;t do any better so we may as well have sold them on</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:44.060"> the first fair. All memories of course Joan aren&#039;t they? Yes. Now if we could come back to</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:52.260"> the school I believe you had some relatives that actually taught at that school</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:57.020"> John. Can you tell us a little bit about that please? Well they didn&#039;t teach at that school.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:02.600"> They taught at the old school up the cabin which is now under the water. I think they moved here</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:10.440"> in 1891. Elizabeth Abley and her sister Alice Ann Abley who became my grandmother. She married</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:22.080"> Evan Jones from Upland Paddock and they were brought here to teach English because they knew</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:30.400"> that the dams was coming and there was a lot of English and Irish and Scotch people moving into</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:37.140"> the area so that was the end of the Welsh language in the Allen Valley school.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:45.760"> The demise of the Welsh language in the valley is something I&#039;d like to touch on now. Prior to that</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:53.800"> your family would have been Welsh speakers presumably, your ancestors. Yes. Do you actually</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:00.480"> remember any of your family older relatives actually speaking Welsh as their day-to-day</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:07.260"> language? Well my father could speak Welsh quite good but as he had an English mother there was</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:15.380"> English spoke at home you know but his father was fluent Welsh and then on my mother&#039;s side the family</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:25.860"> they were all fluent Welsh but you know they had died before I was sort of born so and my</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:35.660"> grandfather and grandmother from the clean they were more English than Welsh because they were</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:45.380"> both well one was brought up but the Gunfad and the other was born brought up at the Dunfad</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:52.560"> Newbridge on Wye. I see and so was Welsh not taught at all then in either of those schools</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:01.700"> the the old one you&#039;ve mentioned and the current one was Welsh not taught at all? No there was no</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:08.240"> Welsh in school when I was there well we did the national anthem and that in Welsh but</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:14.270"> no it was all English. I see and what about your grammar school days then in in Llandrindod</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:20.930"> was did you did you learn Welsh there at all? Yes when I went to Llandrindod I had the choice</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:27.710"> to either learn Welsh or French and I was taught Welsh with a teacher called Annie Griffiths.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:42.410"> Right so sadly well there&#039;s a real resurgence now in learning Welsh of course but it&#039;s you know</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:49.810"> it&#039;s a little sad. Yeah my two grandchildren now Arthur and Marnie are both in the Welsh unit.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:57.990"> That&#039;s a very good idea that&#039;s here in Raerdyr isn&#039;t it? Yes in yes in Brinterion which I&#039;m very</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:04.570"> pleased about because I am very Welsh you know in my thoughts. Very commendable John I&#039;m sure.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:15.230"> John could we touch on pony trekking I understand you had quite an involvement in that in your</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:21.030"> younger days. Yes I was on the pony trekking committee for many years they were called Raerdyr</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:30.110"> Association and Mr David Evans was the secretary and people like Kinsey Morgan and</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:37.790"> Gerald Morgan were chairman and vice chairman and I was always interested in it probably because</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:45.430"> every year a lot of pretty girls came along and I met one called Gina Day and after on and off</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:56.390"> romance for four years I married her and she is now still called Gina Jones but unfortunately</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:04.230"> we got divorced but the trekking was a wonderful thing and I&#039;ve seen up to a hundred ponies going</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:12.550"> out on a day you know terrific line of trekkers and they came from all over the well all over</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:21.850"> Europe actually but in the end I was guide for two years and it was a much harder job then because</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:31.770"> instead of having a trekker for a week who would pick up things you had day trekkers and half of</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:40.050"> them couldn&#039;t ride and you couldn&#039;t go any faster than the slowest rider or the poorest rider and</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:45.770"> some of you had to lead you know but I always found out that if anybody arrived on a motorbike</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:53.910"> they could ride and was the balance was right I&#039;ve never seen a poor rider off a motorbike</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:02.210"> using the same muscles I wouldn&#039;t I wouldn&#039;t doubt fine now John you&#039;ve spoken about</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:08.770"> riding your bike a lot for recreation etc did you use horses as a means of transport</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:17.030"> for getting around generally at all oh yes my father was always on horseback he used to do all</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:24.390"> the gathering of sheep on horseback and I rode a horse a lot like I was probably riding a three</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:32.090"> year old I think I started off on the donkey in Aberystwyth but I&#039;ve got a photo of me on that and</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:42.590"> we had a hill up above the clowind dam called Clodhia so when we wanted to gather that</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:50.970"> we would ride up to the hen front and then go over the top of the hill and drop down on Clodhia</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:57.750"> always on horseback drive the sheep back down what we wanted to bring down to the hen front</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:04.270"> have dinner there with my auntie and uncle and then drive them down to Llanfadog on horseback</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:12.270"> but mind you in those days and talking up to 1979 the roads were much quieter than today</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:20.490"> and you felt quite happy now you can&#039;t go 100 yards without there&#039;s a car behind you</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:27.750"> things have certainly changed haven&#039;t they in the transport department yes and John I understand</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:34.710"> you work very hard and long on compiling your family tree and am I right in thinking that</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:40.850"> it takes you right back to the Lewis Lloyds the original landowners yes well me and my son Tom</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:48.450"> have done a lot of work on it and I&#039;ve had help of other people but being as they were sort of</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:55.230"> indigentry it was quite easy to trace them but Tom has gone back I think it&#039;s 700 years</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:02.670"> to the Powells from Lanarkow who married into the Lewis Lloyds and I&#039;ve got it down to this present</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:10.250"> day which I&#039;m very proud of and now when the dams are very low the walls of Nantwilt have all come</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:19.070"> sight of the gardens you know and that&#039;s what I think you know that it all started for me in</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:26.890"> the Allen Valley well it&#039;s wonderful to see these houses suddenly arising out of the water isn&#039;t it</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:33.690"> it makes you want to do that you mentioned the Llanarkow that was and Nantwilt I believe where</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:42.270"> the where the Lewis Lloyds lived were they actually in the Allen Valley or were they in the Clydewyn</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:48.170"> Valley well it&#039;s actually on the banks of the Clirwyn River isn&#039;t it the Nantwilt estate but</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:59.290"> I mean they own so much of it right up to Clirwyn Farm which you know is miles above the Clirwyn Dam</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:08.970"> and one of my ancestors Peter Jones from Abergwessin who already was a huge landowner</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:16.230"> over there and had thousands of sheep he married into the Lewis Lloyds and the rest is history as</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:24.770"> they say and how long have you been working on this family tree then you and your son oh</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:33.270"> you&#039;re never finished you know there&#039;s something comes up new all the time I found a cousin in</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:40.650"> the other day Sanders her name is Miss Sanders and there&#039;s a lot of them out in Perth and Patagonia</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:51.770"> and um mother&#039;s great uncle David Jones had a farm out in Buenos Aires and the name of the farm</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:02.830"> was Alvira and my mother named my older sister Alvira Mary how nice</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:11.990"> right you have grandchildren now now John um are they enjoying being at the valley and enjoying</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:17.910"> the places where you grew up yes because I&#039;ve still got some ground of belonging to Apple and</div><div class="transcript_line"

            <h2>B</h2>
            <div class="transcript_container"><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:03.220"> Yes, there, we&#039;re ready to go now. Today is Friday the 23rd of September. My name is Jill</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:14.340"> Willey and I&#039;m at Habit Hardware talking to Mr. John Jones who has lived in this area all his</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:22.280"> life. John, thank you very much for agreeing to have a chat with me. First of all, could we just</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:28.980"> start with your year of birth, John, please? I was born on the 2nd of February 1948. And can you</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:36.560"> tell me where you were born? I was born in a bedroom at Upper Llanfadog. Llanfadog. Can you</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:44.420"> tell me exactly where Upper Llanfadog or Llanfadog Ichaf is then, John? Well, as you go from Raida</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:51.580"> up the Ellon Valley, you go past the Ellon Valley Hotel and it&#039;s the next farm on your</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:58.560"> right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:58.980"> About 300 yards away. Thank you. And what sort of facilities do you remember as you were growing</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:07.420"> up? Things like running water and etc. Can you give me some details of that sort of thing?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:13.720"> Well, we had no electricity. The toilet was outside about 50 yards away. And the water we</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:24.540"> had from the spout. And my mother did all the washing and that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:28.980"> And the water was out there by the brook. And bathing was a tin bath brought into the back kitchenolution.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:39.000"> Perhaps twice a week. Sometimes only once a week. And no electricity. So we had these</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:48.420"> paraffin lamps that you had to pump up all the time when the pressure dropped. I see. And how did you get to the</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:58.960"> farm? How much work did you yourself do around the farm, John, as a young boy growing up?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:05.880"> I did quite a bit. When I attended Ellon Village School, I used to milk a cow every morning</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:14.440"> by hand because we saw milk round the Ellon Village, and that was my contribution. I milked</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:21.900"> this one cow who was my favourite, perched on a little stool.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:26.600"> and then I walked to the school afterwards.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:31.480"> And you actually got your water from where exactly, John?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:36.460"> Well, between the house and building at Llanfadog, there was a brook coming down</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:42.660"> and we had a spout and a little pool there and that is where the water came from.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:48.740"> But when I was about 10, we had it piped about 500 yards from another well out in the field</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:57.080"> and that was wonderful spring water and the only time I saw that go dry was in the hot summer of 1976.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:08.200"> Indeed. And were your family born at and grew up in Llanfadog, Upper?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:15.700"> My father was born there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:18.080"> Oh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:18.740"> And my mother was born at the convent, Llania.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:23.780"> Now, were you a large family, John, in Llanfadog?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:28.520"> Yes, we were. I was the fourth, but there was a baby loss between me and the sister above me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:37.900"> So we were five, really. And so there was five of us, but I was born a long time after.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:47.780"> My two older sisters were 22 and 20 when I was born.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:54.920"> And two of my three sisters were married with children, so I have nephews and nieces older than myself.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:03.440"> That&#039;s quite unusual, but of course it does happen.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:09.120"> What sort of major events can you remember in the Elland Valley as you were growing up, John?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:15.240"> Well, I suppose the first one was when the Queen came with the Duke of Edinburgh in October 1952.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:24.100"> I would have been four years old. And I just remember standing outside the hotel over on where the bicycle path is now with our flags.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:35.960"> And my sister Joan was a waitress in the Elland Valley and she waited on the Queen.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:42.700"> Oh, what an accolade, my word.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:45.040"> And what places did you have to play in and to generally just explore in your Elland Valley area?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:54.800"> On a farm. You had plenty of places. You had fields all round you.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:59.400"> But I think me and my nephews enjoyed going down the brook to where it meets the River Elland.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:05.820"> And we were catching minnows there until I was old enough to have a rod and line.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:12.260"> And I loved fishing in those days.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:15.620"> Quite a lot of that goes on at the Elland Valley, doesn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:19.500"> Right, now what memories do you have of the big shearings that took place in the Elland Valley, John?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:26.580"> Oh, well, it was the highlight of the year.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:30.600"> Like, you swapped men with neighbouring farms.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:34.980"> So, you know, there might be 30 men would come to your shearing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:40.060"> And it was the day of the year.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:43.680"> Like, and...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:45.040"> You started off with breakfast and then you had lunch and tea and hopefully you finished about 5 o&#039;clock.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:52.360"> And we had one hill which was up above the Clirwin Dam.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:57.460"> So them sheep had to be driven down on a two-day drive sort of thing to share at Uppal and Vaddog.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:05.140"> And then that night they were taken back up to the Hen Run and they went on from there back to their hill next day.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:12.980"> And shearing was a wonderful thing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:16.860"> As a boy, the highlight was after dinner we&#039;d have a game of football with all the younger men.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:23.820"> But what I remember, there was four or five old men sat outside the barn on a bench all day.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:33.160"> And all they were sitting down and talking about tails.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:38.660"> And they seemed very old to me.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:40.800"> But when I think back, they were probably...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:42.980"> Only in their late 60s, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:45.640"> But the way they dressed and that, I thought they were 100.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:51.580"> But I&#039;m sure they had lots of interesting memories to share.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:55.200"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:55.720"> So would you say that despite the rural locality, you had plenty to do and a very good social life, you knew everyone?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:04.120"> Oh yes, I knew everyone.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:06.640"> And as I&#039;d got two nephews living behind the Elland Valley Hotel,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:12.980"> the three of us sort of played together most nights and played football in the field at Llanfadog.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:20.480"> And later on, when the Birmingham City police cadets came to Elland Village, they had goalposts put up on the green.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:30.080"> So we used to go up there to play football.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:32.900"> And I&#039;ve seen us cycle down to Llanowthal to play Boys of Llanowthal.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:38.840"> And everywhere we went, we cycled.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:43.800"> And I was a founder member of Raider Young Farmers, and that started in 1963.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:51.960"> And till we were old enough to drive, we went there on a pushbike.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:57.740"> Which was up in Bryn Tyrian then. They held the meetings.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:02.620"> And Bryn Tyrian, I understand, is the then secondary school of the area. Is that correct?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:09.660"> Yes, it was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:09.700"> The only time I ever attended...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:12.780"> Bryn Tyrian was to try my 11 plus.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:17.800"> Right. We&#039;ll come on to that now then, on to school life.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:24.200"> Can you tell me where you went to school and what age you were when you started, John?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:30.740"> I went to Elland Village Primary School at East 1953.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:40.080"> My birthday was February.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:42.160"> So I&#039;d...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:42.680"> I&#039;d been there for a year.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:42.760"> I&#039;d just gone five.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:44.340"> And my sister Joan took me to school the first morning.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:48.280"> And all the other pupils were stood in the entrance, I think, waiting the newcomer.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:55.540"> And I was there till 1959.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:00.520"> And I had many a happy time looking back in the Valley School.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:05.320"> We were never more than 20 pupils.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:09.020"> And I think when I left, they were down to 12.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:13.480"> And there was two teachers there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:16.420"> The first teacher was Mrs. Jim Price, or Mrs. Betty Price.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:20.880"> And the senior teacher was Miss Chew.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:26.420"> I have heard those names.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:29.860"> Right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:30.820"> Could I add one more thing?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:32.620"> Please.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:32.940"> The only thing I hated about the Elland Valley School, every June, the Lord Mayor of Birmingham came down.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:42.260"> And we had the June Tea.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:44.500"> And, of course, the tea was nice.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:46.720"> I loved that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:47.940"> But afterwards, we had to perform on stage.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:51.100"> And every year, they seemed to have me to sing a solo.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:54.640"> And after that, the Lady Mayoress presented us all with a book for what we&#039;d done during the year.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:01.960"> If you&#039;d done well, you had the best books.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:07.180"> Right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:08.540"> And am I right in thinking that the school at the Elland Valley School,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:12.240"> the Elland Village, was where the lodge is now?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:15.960"> Yes, it was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:17.380"> There was a school immediately above it when the works were going on.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:24.800"> But this new school was built in 1909.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:28.920"> And my mother went to the old school just above it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:33.520"> But my father was not allowed to go to that school</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:38.240"> because he was living in the Radnish Ascent.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:42.240"> And he had to walk three miles to come to the school every day.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:48.340"> So you yourself went to the Elland Village School,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:52.580"> but you were still in what was then Radnish, weren&#039;t you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:56.180"> So were there many other children from Radnish in that school?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:02.800"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:03.480"> I think at the time I left, there was just two of us.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:07.400"> The other boy didn&#039;t try the 11 plus.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:10.680"> So he went straight to the 11 plus.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:12.240"> He went straight to Brynturion.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:13.360"> There was three the same age as me living on the Breckinshire side.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:19.020"> So they went to BILF High School.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:21.780"> And they didn&#039;t have to try the 11 plus.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:24.700"> I was the only one out of the five of us that had to try the 11 plus.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:29.500"> And was that because Radnish and Breckinshire,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:32.140"> being different authorities,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:33.780"> had decided different rules regarding the 11 plus?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:37.860"> Yes, it had.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:38.980"> I mean, it&#039;s different now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:41.240"> You can go to any school.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:42.780"> But in them days it was Radnish and Breckinshire.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:46.180"> And I only lived 200 yards from the River Elland.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:50.100"> And if I&#039;d been the other side, I&#039;d have been in Breckinshire.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:54.280"> And would not have had to take the 11 plus, I see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:58.120"> Now having taken the 11 plus, what school did you then go to, John?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:02.340"> I went to Lander and Dudd Grammar School in the first week of September 1959,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:07.260"> when a school car driven by Mr Harold Ashton</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:13.380"> from the shop down opposite Jimmy Lloyd&#039;s yard</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:17.340"> drove me down to the bus.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:19.400"> And then we met the bus up by the Smithfield in Raider.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:25.320"> And there was a boys&#039; bus and a girls&#039; bus.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:29.420"> And how long were you at that school, travelling to and from then, John?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:34.380"> Well, I left in...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:37.240"> 1963, because I&#039;d had a couple of run-ins with Mr Harold&#039;s headmaster.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:44.360"> And he said that I had to try my O levels.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:47.660"> And I said, I&#039;ll show you.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:49.160"> And I left.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:53.640"> You left. Right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:56.320"> Well, John, you must have seen quite a lot of changes in the valley.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:02.280"> Would you like to talk a little bit about the development of the valley as you know it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:07.240"> Well, I&#039;ve seen lots of changes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:10.840"> Not for the better, in my opinion.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:14.080"> I, you know, although I&#039;m a proud Welshman,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:18.080"> Birmingham were very good landlords.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:21.140"> And they were good to the farmers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:23.100"> And they would provide new gates and hurdles and fencing material every year.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:29.240"> And then when it changed over to Welsh Water,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:31.880"> it was a downward spiral.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:35.680"> And I think the valley was much better in those days.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:41.840"> Much tidier.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:43.120"> You could fish from the Cabin Dam to Garrick Dee.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:46.620"> That railway line had two or three sheep in it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:49.560"> And it kept all the foliage down.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:51.700"> Now it&#039;s just like a jungle.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:54.580"> And you can&#039;t fish one yard of it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:57.980"> Very, very unfortunate.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:59.460"> Because fishing is really quite a prominent activity in our area, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:04.720"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:06.520"> Speaking about the livestock now,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:08.880"> how often did you actually come into Raida to the market or to any other market?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:14.660"> Well, I don&#039;t remember coming much.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:17.140"> My father, you know, would bring a cow or cow and calf or something occasionally to the mart.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:24.780"> And we&#039;d always sell our sale ewes in the autumn.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:29.540"> And we drove them down with two dogs.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:33.480"> And I sometimes walked in front and my father behind.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:38.580"> And we never lost one.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:41.000"> We always got them to the market and tied the dogs up there all day and sold.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:47.540"> And one year the prices were poor, so we didn&#039;t sell.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:54.160"> I was about 16 at the time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:56.820"> Anyway, my father was getting on then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:00.420"> And a car stopped when we were driving down.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:03.480"> And he was driving his sheep home.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:04.280"> And he offered father a lift home.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:07.360"> And he said, I&#039;ll leave my dog with you.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:10.120"> And soon as father got in the car, the dog went back towards Raida.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:15.820"> And unfortunately, he got killed by a car.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:19.580"> And I got the sheep home with my dog.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:23.340"> And then my sister Joan went back to Raida in the van to look for this dog</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:29.420"> and found him dead on the road and brought him back.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:33.480"> And that&#039;s what happened.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:33.740"> And I&#039;m so sad.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:34.060"> How unfortunate.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:35.560"> One that I&#039;m sure...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:36.960"> And we took the sheep to the next fair and didn&#039;t do any better.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:41.840"> So we may as well have sold them on the first fair.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:45.940"> All memories, of course, Joan, aren&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:48.580"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:49.320"> Now, if we could come back to the school.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:52.700"> I believe you had some relatives that actually taught at that school, John.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:57.360"> Can you tell us a little bit about that, please?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:59.940"> Well, they didn&#039;t teach at that school.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:02.320"> They taught at the old school up the cabin, which is now under the water.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:07.960"> I think they moved here in 1891.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:14.320"> Elizabeth Ably and her sister Alice Anne Ably, who became my grandmother.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:21.320"> She married Evan Jones from Upperland Paddock.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:25.280"> And they were brought here to teach English because they knew that the dams was coming.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:32.320"> And there was a lot of English and Irish and Scots people moving into the area.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:38.320"> So that was the end of the Welsh language in the Allen Valley School.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:45.140"> The demise of the Welsh language in the valley is something I&#039;d like to touch on now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:52.500"> Prior to that, your family would have been Welsh speakers, presumably, your ancestors.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:59.000"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:59.220"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:59.540"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:00.000"> Do you actually remember any of your family, older relatives, actually speaking Welsh as their day-to-day language?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:08.060"> Well, my father could speak Welsh quite good.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:11.380"> But as he had an English mother, there was English spoke at home, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:17.960"> But his father was fluent Welsh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:21.580"> And then on my mother&#039;s side, the family, they were all fluent Welsh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:27.480"> But, you know, they had died before I was sort of born.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:32.700"> So, and my grandfather and grandmother from the clean, they were more English than Welsh because they were both, well, one was brought up at the Gunfan and the other was born, brought up at the Dunfan New Bridge on Wye.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:55.460"> I see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:56.520"> And so, was Welsh not taught at all then in either of those schools, the old one you&#039;ve mentioned and the current one?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:04.620"> Was Welsh not taught at all?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:06.720"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:07.200"> There was no Welsh in school when I was there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:10.040"> Well, we did the national anthem and that in Welsh, but no, it was all English.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:15.900"> I see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:16.580"> And what about your grammar school days then in Llandrindod?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:20.860"> Did you learn Welsh there at all?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:24.200"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:24.820"> When I went to Llandrindod, I went to Llandrindod.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:26.520"> I had the choice to either learn Welsh or French and I was taught Welsh with a teacher called Annie Griffiths.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:41.420"> Right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:42.620"> So, sadly, well, there&#039;s a real resurgence now in learning Welsh, of course, but it&#039;s, you know, it&#039;s a little sad.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:50.380"> Yeah, my two grandchildren now, Arthur and Marnie, are both in the Welsh unit.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:57.600"> That&#039;s a very good idea. That&#039;s here in Raeder, is it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:00.360"> Yes, in, yes, up in Rintyria.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:02.680"> Oh, okay.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:03.340"> Which I am very pleased about because I am very Welsh, you know, in my thoughts.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:11.960"> Very commendable, John, I&#039;m sure.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:14.680"> John, could we touch on pony trekking? I understand you had quite an involvement in that in your younger days.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:21.860"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:22.160"> I was on pony trekking.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:25.780"> I was on the pony trekking committee for many years.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:27.540"> They were called Raeder Pony Trekking Association.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:31.280"> And Mr. David Evans was the secretary and people like Kinsey Morgan and Gerald Morgan were chairman and vice chairman.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:40.660"> And I was always interested in it, probably because every year a lot of pretty girls came along.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:49.500"> And I met one called Gina Day.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:53.080"> And after on and off romance for four years, I married her.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:59.360"> And she is now still called Gina Jones.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:02.860"> But unfortunately, we got divorced.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:05.360"> But the trekking was a wonderful thing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:08.740"> And I&#039;ve seen up to 100 ponies going out on a day, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:15.400"> Terrific line of trekkers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:17.680"> And they came from all over the, well, all over Europe, actually.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:23.080"> But in the end, I was guide for two years.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:28.360"> And it was a much harder job then because instead of having a trekker for a week who would pick up things, you had day trekkers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:38.020"> And half of them couldn&#039;t ride.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:40.780"> And you couldn&#039;t go any faster than the slowest rider or the poorest rider.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:45.280"> And some of you had to lead, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:47.720"> But I always found out that if anybody arrived on a mountain, they were going to be a little bit slower.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:53.060"> And if they had a motorbike, they could ride.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:55.380"> The balance was right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:57.420"> I&#039;ve never seen a poor rider off a motorbike.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:01.980"> Using the same muscles.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:03.620"> I wouldn&#039;t doubt.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:06.240"> Fine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:07.040"> Now, John, you&#039;ve spoken about riding your bike a lot for recreation, etc.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:12.860"> Did you use horses as a means of transport for getting around generally at all?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:19.660"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:20.140"> My father was always on horseback.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:23.060"> He used to do all the gathering of sheep on horseback.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:26.820"> And I rode a horse a lot.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:29.080"> Like, I was probably riding a three-year-old.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:32.640"> I think I started off on the donkey in Aberystwyth.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:36.780"> But I&#039;ve got a photo of me on that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:39.240"> And we had a hill up above the Clervin Dam called Clwyddyr.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:46.860"> So when we wanted to gather that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:50.140"> We would ride up to the Henvryn.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:53.000"> And then go over the top of the hill and drop down on Clwyddyr.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:57.520"> Always on horseback.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:59.280"> Drive the sheep back down what we wanted to bring down to the Henvryn.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:04.040"> Have dinner there with my auntie and uncle.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:07.540"> And then drive them down to Llanfadog on horseback.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:12.180"> But mind you, in those days, I&#039;m talking up to 1979.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:17.620"> The roads were much quieter than today.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:20.040"> And you felt quite happy.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:22.560"> Now you can&#039;t go 100 yards without a car behind you.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:27.400"> Things have certainly changed, haven&#039;t they, in the transport department.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:32.640"> And John, I understand you&#039;ve worked very hard and long on compiling your family tree.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:39.260"> And am I right in thinking that it takes you right back to the Lewis Lloyds, the original landowners?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:45.620"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:46.480"> Well, me and my son Tom have done a lot of work on it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:49.740"> And I&#039;ve had help of other people.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:52.700"> But being as they were sort of landed gentry, it was quite easy to trace them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:58.480"> But Tom has gone back, I think it&#039;s 700 years, to the Powells from Lanarkow, who married into the Lewis Lloyds.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:07.580"> And I&#039;ve got it down to this present day, which I&#039;m very proud of.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:12.300"> And now when the dams are very low, the walls of Nantwilt have all come in sight.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:19.980"> And the gardens, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:22.020"> And that&#039;s where I think, you know, that it all started for me in the Ellon Valley.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:28.220"> Well, it&#039;s wonderful to see these houses suddenly arising out of the water, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:33.560"> It makes you want to do that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:35.200"> You mentioned the Lanarkow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:38.680"> That was Nantwilt, I believe, where the Lewis Lloyds lived.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:44.740"> Were they actually in the Ellon Valley or were they in the Clydwyn Valley?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:51.140"> Well, it&#039;s actually on the banks of the Clydwyn River, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:55.500"> The Nantwilt estate.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:58.600"> But I mean, they owned so much of it, right up to Clydwyn Farm, which, you know, is miles above the Clydwyn Dam.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:07.300"> And one of my ancestors, Peter Jones from Abergwessing, who already was a huge landowner over there and had thousands of sheep,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:19.740"> he married into the Lewis Lloyds and the rest is history, as they say.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:25.460"> And how long have you been working on this family tree then, you and your son?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:30.080"> Oh, you&#039;re never finished.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:34.840"> You know, there&#039;s something comes up new all the time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:38.600"> I found a cousin in London the other day, Sanders, her name is, Miss Sanders.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:45.300"> And there&#039;s a lot of them out in Perth.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:49.740"> And Patagonia.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:51.260"> And mother&#039;s great uncle, David Jones, had a farm out in Buenos Aires.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:00.620"> And the name of the farm was Elvira.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:03.880"> And my mother named my older sister Elvira Mary.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:09.380"> How nice.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:11.660"> Right. You have grandchildren now, John.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:14.760"> Are they enjoying being at the valley and enjoying the places where you grew up?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:19.380"> Yes, because I&#039;ve still got some ground belonging to Apple and Raddock.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:25.100"> And they love it up there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:27.940"> Arthur went up the other day to burn a bit of cardboard or something, and he thinks it&#039;s wonderful.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:33.600"> And Marnie&#039;s up there every night with her father, running a dog around.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:38.920"> And I think it&#039;s nice to get out of town.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:44.420"> Well, what better place, indeed, than the beautiful...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:48.380"> The beautiful Ellen Valley.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:51.580"> Well, John, it&#039;s been absolutely fascinating talking to you.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:55.820"> We could go on all day, really, thinking about things.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:58.460"> So thank you very, very much for your input, your time, and all your fascinating information.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:04.740"> Thank you very much for you asking me these questions.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:10.100"> You&#039;re welcome.</div></div><br>

            <h2>C</h2>
            <div class="transcript_container"><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:04.500"> Yes, we&#039;re ready to go now. Today is Friday the 23rd of September. My name is Jill Willey and I&#039;m at Habit Hardware talking to Mr. John Jones, who has lived in this area all his life.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:24.100"> John, thank you very much for agreeing to have a chat with me. First of all, could we just start with your year of birth, John, please?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:31.820"> I was born on the 2nd of February, 1948.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:35.880"> And can you tell me where you were born?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:38.160"> I was born in a bedroom up a Llanfadog.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:43.740"> Llanfadog. Can you tell me exactly where Llanfadog is then, John?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:00:49.980"> Well, as you go from Rader up the Llanfadog, you go past the Llanfadog Hotel and it&#039;s the next farm on your right, about 300 yards away.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:02.620"> Thank you. And what sort of facilities do you remember as you were growing up? Things like running water and etc. Can you give me some details of that sort of thing?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:13.480"> Well, we had no electricity. The toilet was outside, about 50 yards away. And the water we had from the spout.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:25.880"> And my mother did all the washing and that out there by the brook. And bathing was a tin bath brought into the back kitchen, perhaps twice a week, sometimes only once a week.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:42.360"> And no electricity. So we had these paraffin lamps that you had to pump up all the time when the pressure dropped.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:01:56.540"> I see. And how much work did you yourself do around the farm, John, as a young boy growing up?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:06.100"> I did quite a bit. When I attended Llanfadog Village School, I used to milk a cow every morning by hand because we sold milk around the Llanfadog Village.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:18.980"> And that was my contribution. I milked this one cow, perched on a little stool, and then I walked to the school afterwards.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:31.680"> And you actually got your water from where exactly, John?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:36.700"> Well, between the house and building at Llanfadog, there was a brook coming down. And we had a spout and a little pool there. And that is where the water came from.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:02:48.840"> But when I was about 10, we had it piped about 500 yards from another well out in the field. And that was wonderful spring water. And the only time I saw that go dry was in the hot summer of 1976.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:08.300"> Indeed. And were your family born at and grew up in Llanfadog Upper?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:15.560"> My father was born there. My father was born there. And my mother was born at the Gunvind Llanfadog.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:23.400"> Now, were you a large family, John, in Van Baderog?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:28.460"> Yes, we were. I was the fourth. But there was a baby loss between me and the sister above me. So we were five, really. And so there was five of us. But I was born a long time after.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:03:47.860"> My two older sisters was 22 and 20 when I was born. And two up to my three sisters were married with children. So I have nephews and nieces older than myself.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:03.440"> That&#039;s quite unusual. But of course, it does happen.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:09.460"> What sort of major events can you remember in the Llanfadog as you were growing up, John?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:15.380"> Well, I suppose the first one was when the Queen came with the Duke of Edinburgh in October 1952. I would have been four years old. And I just remember standing outside the hotel over on where the bicycle path is now with our flags.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:36.000"> And my sister, Joan, was a waitress in the Ellen Valley and she waited on the Queen.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:42.860"> Oh, what an accolade, my word. And what places did you have to play in and to generally just explore in your Ellen Valley area?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:04:54.600"> On a farm. You had plenty of places. You had fields all around you. But I think me and my nephews enjoyed going down the brook to where it meets the River Ellen.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:05.920"> And we were catching minnows there until I was old enough to have a rod and line. And I loved fishing in those days.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:15.840"> Quite a lot of that goes on at the Ellen Valley, doesn&#039;t it? Right. Now, what memories do you have of the big shearings that took place in the Ellen Valley, John?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:26.400"> Oh, well, it was the highlight of the year. Like you swapped men with neighbouring farms. So, you know, there might be 30 men would come to your shearings.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:39.800"> And it was the day of the year. And you started off with breakfast and then you had lunch and tea and hopefully you finished about five o&#039;clock.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:05:52.440"> And we had one hill which was up above the Clurwyn Dam. So, them sheep had to be driven down on a two-day drive sort of thing to share at Upperland-Vadag.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:05.120"> And then that night they were taken back up to the Hen Run and they went on from there back to their hill next day.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:13.780"> And sharing was a wonderful thing. As a boy, the highlight was after dinner, we&#039;d have a game of football with all the younger men.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:23.680"> But what I remember, there was four or five old men sat outside the barn on a bench all day and all they were sitting down and talking about tales.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:38.820"> And they seemed very old to me. But when I think back, they were probably only in their late 60s, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:45.660"> But the way they dressed and that, I thought they were a hundred.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:51.640"> But I&#039;m sure they had lots of interesting memories to share.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:06:55.420"> Yes. So, would you say that despite the rural locality, you had plenty to do and a very good social life, you knew everyone?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:04.180"> Oh, yes. I knew everyone.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:06.260"> And as I&#039;d got two nephews living behind the Ellen Valley Hotel, the three of us sort of played together most nights and played football in the field at Len Badog.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:20.420"> And later on, when Birmingham City Police Cadets came to Ellen Village, they had goalposts put up on the green.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:30.200"> So, we used to go up there to play football.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:33.060"> And I&#039;ve seen a cycle down to Lanworthville to play boys of Lanworthville.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:39.460"> And everywhere we went, we cycled.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:43.940"> And I was a founder member of Rader Young Farmers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:49.320"> And that started in 1963.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:52.120"> And till we were old enough to drive, we went there on a pushbike.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:07:57.920"> Which was up in Brintirion then, they held the meetings.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:02.720"> And Brintirion, I understand, is the then secondary school of the area.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:08.920"> Yes, it was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:09.620"> The only time I ever attended Brintirion was to try my 11+.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:18.720"> Right. We&#039;ll come on to that now then, on to school life.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:24.360"> Can you tell me where you went to school and what age you were when you started, John?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:29.520"> I went to Ellen Village Primary School at East...</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:40.340"> My birthday was February, so I had just gone five.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:44.540"> And my sister Joan took me to school the first morning.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:48.480"> And all the other pupils were stood in the entrance, I think waiting the newcomer.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:08:56.760"> And I was there till 1959.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:00.620"> And I had many a happy time looking back in the Valley School.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:05.660"> We were never more than 20 pupils.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:08.640"> And I think when I left, they were down to 12.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:13.500"> And there was two teachers there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:16.660"> The first teacher was Mrs. Jim Price or Mrs. Betty Price.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:21.040"> And the senior teacher was Miss Chew.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:26.560"> I have heard those names.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:29.960"> Right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:30.980"> Could I add one more thing?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:32.660"> Please.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:33.180"> The only thing I hated about the Ellen Valley School,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:38.200"> every June, the Lord Mayor of Birmingham came down and we had the June tea.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:44.560"> And of course the tea was nice.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:47.040"> I loved that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:47.860"> But afterwards we had to perform on stage.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:51.240"> And every year they seemed to have me to sing a solo.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:09:54.880"> And after that the Lady Mayoress presented us all with a book for what we&#039;d done during the year.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:02.220"> If you&#039;ve done well, you had the best books.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:07.340"> Right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:08.620"> And am I right in thinking that the school at the Ellen Village was where the lodge is now?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:16.060"> Yes, it was.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:17.860"> There was a school immediately above it when the works were going on.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:24.960"> But this new school was built in 1909.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:29.160"> And my mother went to the old school just above it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:33.700"> But my father was not allowed to go to that school because he was living in the Radnorshire side.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:42.640"> And he had to walk three miles to come to the school every day.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:48.220"> So you yourself went to the Ellen Village School but you were still in what was then Radnorshire, weren&#039;t you?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:10:56.420"> So were there many other children from Radnorshire in that school?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:02.880"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:03.780"> No.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:03.820"> I think at the time I left there was just two of us.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:07.540"> The other boy didn&#039;t try the 11 plus.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:10.820"> So he went straight to Brinturian.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:13.560"> There was three the same age as me living on the Breckenshire side.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:18.940"> So they went to Bilf High School.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:21.660"> And they didn&#039;t have to try the 11 plus.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:24.800"> I was the only one out of the five of us that had to try the 11 plus.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:29.280"> And was that because Radnorshire and Breckenshire being different authorities had decided different rules regarding the 11 plus?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:37.860"> Yes it had.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:39.520"> I mean it&#039;s different now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:41.280"> You can go to any school.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:42.900"> But in them days it was Radnorshire and Breckenshire.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:46.320"> And I only lived 200 yards from the River Ellen.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:49.980"> And if I&#039;d been the other side of it I&#039;d have been in Breckenshire.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:54.400"> And would not have had to take the 11 plus.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:57.700"> I see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:11:58.500"> Now having taken the 11 plus what school did you then go to John?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:02.380"> I went to Landrinder Grammar School in the first week of September 1959.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:08.700"> When a school car driven by Mr Harold Ashton from the shop down opposite Jimmy Lloyd&#039;s yard.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:19.180"> And then we met the bus up by the Smithfield in Rader.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:25.420"> And there was a boys bus and a girls bus.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:29.600"> And how long were you at that school travelling to and from then John?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:34.640"> Well I left in 1963 because I&#039;d had a couple of run-ins with Mr Howell&#039;s headmaster.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:44.260"> And he said that I had to try my O-levels and I said I&#039;ll show you.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:49.340"> And I left.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:53.780"> You left.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:55.160"> Right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:12:56.900"> John you must have seen quite a lot of changes in the valley.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:02.340"> Would you like to talk a little bit about the development of the valley as you know it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:07.160"> Well I&#039;ve seen lots of changes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:11.000"> Not for the better in my opinion.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:14.400"> I, you know, although I&#039;m a proud Welshman,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:18.420"> Birmingham were very good landlords.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:21.340"> And they were good to the farmers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:23.320"> And they would provide new gates and hurdles and fencing material every year.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:28.400"> And then when it changed over to Welsh water it was a downward spiral.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:36.760"> And I think the valley was much better in those days.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:42.280"> Much tidier.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:43.300"> You could fish from the Cabin Dam to Garrick D.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:46.840"> That railway line had two or three sheep in it and it kept all the foliage down.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:51.540"> Now it&#039;s just like a jungle and you can&#039;t fish one yard of it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:13:57.960"> Very, very unfortunate because fishing is really quite a prominent activity in our area, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:05.860"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:06.740"> Speaking about the livestock now,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:09.000"> how often did you actually come into Raida to the market or to any other market?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:14.740"> Well I don&#039;t remember coming much.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:17.120"> My father, you know, would bring a cow or cow and cab or something occasionally to the mart.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:24.900"> And we&#039;d always sell our sale ewes in the autumn.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:29.980"> And we drove them down with two dogs.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:34.380"> And I sometimes walked in front and my father behind.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:38.660"> And we never lost one.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:41.140"> We always got them to the market and tied the dogs up there all day.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:45.280"> And sold.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:48.180"> And one year the prices were poor.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:52.900"> So we didn&#039;t sell.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:54.320"> I was about 16 at the time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:14:57.100"> Anyway, my father was getting on then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:00.640"> And a car stopped when we were driving these sheep home.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:04.440"> And he offered father a lift home.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:07.280"> And he said, I&#039;ll leave my dog with you.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:10.360"> And soon as father got in the car, the dog went back towards Raida.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:15.700"> And unfortunately he got killed by a car.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:19.740"> And I got the sheep home with my dog.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:23.140"> And then my sister Joan went back to Raida in the van to look for this dog.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:29.760"> And found him dead on the road and brought him back.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:32.900"> That was a sad day.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:34.540"> How unfortunate one that I&#039;m sure.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:37.120"> And we took the sheep to the next fair and didn&#039;t do any better.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:42.060"> So we may as well have sold them on the first fair.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:46.000"> All memories of course, Joan, aren&#039;t they?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:48.760"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:49.700"> Now if we could come back to the school.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:52.720"> I believe you had some relatives that actually taught at that school, John.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:15:57.580"> Can you tell us a little bit about that, please?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:00.200"> Well, they didn&#039;t teach at that school.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:02.660"> They taught at the old school up the cabin which is now under the water.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:08.000"> I think they moved here in 1891.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:13.980"> Elizabeth Abley and her sister Alice Ann Abley, who became my grandmother.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:21.280"> She married Evan Jones from Upperland Paddock.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:25.440"> And they were brought here to teach English because they knew that the dams was coming.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:32.260"> And there was a lot of English and Irish and Scots people moving into the area.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:37.600"> So that was the end of the Welsh language in the Ellen Valley School.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:45.320"> The demise of the Welsh language in the valley is something I&#039;d like to touch on now.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:52.660"> Prior to that, your family would have been Welsh speakers, presumably, your ancestors.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:58.700"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:16:59.640"> Do you actually remember any of your family, older relatives, actually speaking Welsh as their day-to-day language?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:07.660"> Well, my father could speak Welsh quite good, but as he had an English mother, there was English spoke at home, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:18.040"> But his father was fluent Welsh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:21.800"> And then on my mother&#039;s side, the family, they were all fluent Welsh.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:27.820"> But, you know, they had died before I was sort of born.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:17:33.800"> And my grandfather and grandmother from the clean, they were more English than Welsh because they were both, well, one was brought up at the Gunford and the other was brought up at the Dunford Newbridge on White.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:22.000"> I see.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:24.220"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:25.080"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:25.140"> When I went to London, I had the choice to either learn Welsh or French.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:30.860"> And I was taught Welsh with a teacher called Annie Griffiths.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:41.580"> Right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:42.940"> So, sadly, well, there&#039;s a real resurgence now in learning Welsh, of course, but it&#039;s, you know, it&#039;s a little sad.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:49.960"> Yeah, my two grandchildren now, Arthur and Marnie, are both in the Welsh unit.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:18:57.720"> That&#039;s a very good idea. That&#039;s here in Rhaedra, is it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:00.380"> Yes, in Rhaedra, in Tyrion.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:02.760"> Oh, right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:03.340"> Which I&#039;m very pleased about, because I am very Welsh, you know, in my thoughts.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:11.960"> Very commendable, John, I&#039;m sure.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:14.920"> John, could we touch on pony trekking?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:17.540"> I understand you had quite an involvement in that in your younger days.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:21.580"> Yes, I was on the pony trekking committee for many years.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:27.780"> They were called Rhaedra Pony Trekking Association.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:32.000"> And Mr. David Evans was the secretary.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:34.380"> And people like Kinsey Morgan and Gerald Morgan were chairman and vice chairman.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:40.960"> And I was always interested in it, probably because every year a lot of pretty girls came along.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:49.360"> And I met one called Gina Day.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:54.140"> And after an on and off romance for four years, I married her.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:19:59.440"> And she is now still called Gina Jones.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:03.040"> But unfortunately, we got divorced.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:05.580"> But the trekking was a wonderful thing.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:08.800"> And I&#039;ve seen up to 100 ponies going out on a day, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:14.600"> A terrific line of trekkers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:17.980"> And they came from all over the, well, all over Europe, actually.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:23.580"> But in the end, I was guide for two years.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:28.340"> And it was a much harder job then.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:31.480"> Because instead of having a trekker for a week who would pick up things,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:36.260"> you had day trekkers.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:38.240"> And half of them couldn&#039;t ride.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:40.740"> And you couldn&#039;t go any faster than the slowest rider.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:44.000"> Or the poorest rider.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:45.700"> And some of you had to lead, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:47.860"> But I always found out that if anybody arrived on a motorbike,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:54.040"> they could ride.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:55.740"> The balance was right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:20:57.540"> I&#039;ve never seen a poor rider off a motorbike.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:02.180"> Using the same muscles, I wouldn&#039;t doubt.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:06.360"> Fine.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:07.180"> Now, John, you&#039;ve spoken about riding your bike a lot.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:11.040"> For recreation, etc.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:12.680"> Did you use horses as a means of transport for getting around generally at all?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:19.680"> Oh, yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:20.540"> My father was always on horseback.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:23.180"> He used to do all the gathering of sheep on horseback.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:26.980"> And I rode a horse a lot.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:28.900"> Like, I was probably riding a three-year-old.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:32.820"> I think I started off on the donkey in Aberystwyth.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:36.740"> But I&#039;ve got a photo of me on that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:39.040"> And we had a hill above the Clirwyn Dam called Crothia.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:21:46.760"> So, when we wanted to gather that, we would ride up to the Henfren and then go over the top of the hill and drop down on Clirwyn.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:01.980"> And then drive them down to Llanfadog on horseback.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:12.520"> And then drive them down to Llanfadog on horseback.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:26.100"> And then drive them down to Llanfadog on horseback.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:27.520"> Things have certainly changed, haven&#039;t they, in the transport department?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:32.080"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:32.900"> And, John, I understand you&#039;ve worked very hard and long on compiling your family tree.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:39.180"> And am I right in thinking that it takes you right back to the Lewis Lloyds, the original landowners?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:45.740"> Yes.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:46.700"> Well, me and my son Tom have done a lot of work on it.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:49.820"> And I&#039;ve had help of other people.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:52.800"> But being as they were sort of landed gentry, it was quite easy to trace them.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:22:58.400"> But Tom has gone back, I think it&#039;s 700 years, to the Powells from Lanarkow who married into the Lewis Lloyds.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:07.780"> And I&#039;ve got it down to this present day, which I&#039;m very proud of.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:12.480"> And now when the dams are very low, the walls of Nankwilt have all come in sight of the gardens, you know.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:21.960"> And that&#039;s where I think, you know, that it all started for me in the Ellon Valley.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:28.400"> Well, it&#039;s wonderful to see these houses suddenly arising out of the water, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:33.600"> It makes you want to do that.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:35.300"> You mentioned the Llanarkow.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:38.840"> That was Nankwilt, I believe, where the Lewis Lloyds lived.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:45.020"> Were they actually in the Ellon Valley or were they in the Clydwin Valley?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:51.220"> Well, it&#039;s actually on the banks of the Clirwin River, isn&#039;t it?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:56.020"> The Nankwilt estate.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:23:58.680"> But, I mean, they own so much of it right up to Clirwin Farm, which, you know, is miles above the Clirwin Dam.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:09.040"> And one of my ancestors, Peter Jones from Aberguesson, who already was a huge landowner over there and had thousands of sheep,</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:19.340"> he married into the Lewis Lloyds and the rest is history, as they say.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:25.680"> And how long have you been working on this family tree then, you and your son?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:29.860"> Oh, you&#039;re never finished.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:35.320"> You know, there&#039;s something comes up new all the time.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:38.660"> I found a cousin in London the other day, Sanders.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:43.440"> Her name is Miss Sanders.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:45.160"> And there&#039;s a lot of them out in Perth and Patagonia.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:24:51.900"> And mother&#039;s great-uncle, David Jones, had a farm out in Buenos Aires.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:00.560"> And the name of the farm was Alvira.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:04.160"> And my mother named my oldest sister Alvira Mary.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:09.680"> How nice.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:11.740"> Right.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:12.500"> You have grandchildren now, John.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:15.000"> Are they enjoying being at the valley and enjoying the places where you grew up?</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:19.540"> Yes, because I&#039;ve still got some ground belonging to Apple and Laddook.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:25.360"> And they love it up there.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:28.240"> Arthur went up the other day to burn a bit of cardboard or something and he thinks it&#039;s wonderful.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:33.720"> And Marnie&#039;s up there every night with her father running a dog round.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:38.560"> And I think it&#039;s nice to get out of town.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:44.460"> Well, what better place, indeed, than the beautiful Ellen Valley.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:52.080"> Well, John, it&#039;s been absolutely fascinating talking to you.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:55.980"> We could go on all day, really, thinking about things.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:25:58.720"> So thank you very, very much for your input, your time and all your fascinating information.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:04.940"> Thank you very much for you asking me these questions.</div><div class="transcript_line" data-time="00:26:10.280"> You&#039;re welcome.</div></div><br>
