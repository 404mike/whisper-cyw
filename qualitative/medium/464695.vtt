Has television influenced your leisure time over the years?

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:10.900
How is it? Not a great deal, no, because, you know, we came from a family that really,

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.100
as I think I pointed out too, when you first phone, you know, television was not the main

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.080
thing as you see when we pointed to some friends, that's a great big thing stuff on the wall.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.000
When I was always discreetly putting the car on the be-h- earnest, I was a very nice veneered

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.380
cabinet, didn't it, a wall with doors, and for some reason everyone used to cover them

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.680
with cloths in those days, why was that?

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.540
What?

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.860
What my friend Mavis was telling me yesterday when I was saying you were coming, her mum

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.440
always used to put a big cloth over the television at night and my mother too, whether they felt

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.400
that it would keep the picture clear or whether to keep the rays away, and at one time we

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.600
never told not to sit within three or four metres of televisions, weren't we, but I don't

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.580
know if that warning still exists, we never hear of it now, do we? Usually the engineers

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.700
used to advise where to put it and where the seats were when we had one, but no one's mentioned

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.920
that lately, have they?

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.260
Thank you.
