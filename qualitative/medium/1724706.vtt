I am married to a gorgeous husband called Mark in Ammulenned.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:19.760
We got married September the 5th, 2014. It was the best day of my life I could think of.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.680
A lot of people turned up, Mark's family turned up.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.640
Glad in a way that my family didn't turn up because I didn't want them there.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:46.680
Basically it was a very emotional time of day because I absolutely broke into tears and whatever

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:57.980
because it was an emotional day. Mark's family broke into tears as well. We got emotional and upset.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:06.880
Some of my friends were upset on the day because of me getting married. Happy upset? Happy.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:17.760
How did Mark propose? With a wedding ring. With a wedding ring? Yeah. Did he plan?

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:26.880
What happened, we got married in a posh hotel in a, I can't remember the name of the place,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:35.460
but I don't think the hotel's there anymore. I think it's closed down or somebody's overtaken it.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.120
Basically we stayed in a hot tub and the hot tub was absolutely out of this world.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:55.880
We were in the hot tub, fully naked and we were both absolutely pissed out of our heads.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.820
I meant we were drunk.
