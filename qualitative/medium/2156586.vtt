00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:15.880
Jill Jones talking to Shirley Davis, continuation. So Shirley, when the Minera limestone quarry

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.700
closed, can you tell me a little bit about what happened next there?

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:27.140
Yes, it was closed for quite some time and there were a number of us in the village who

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.840
were quite concerned about what was going to happen in the limeworks, what the future

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:41.260
of it was going to be, because it was an area where many of us did walk, but it was becoming

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.540
very overgrown, we were finding it more and more difficult to get in and out of there.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:58.920
And we heard via my husband actually, who was on the council at the time, that it was up for sale.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.460
And as a result of this, a few of us got together, we got together in the City Arms,

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:15.880
which was a pub that was open at the time, and at that first meeting I was appointed as the chair

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:25.000
of a new group which was looking into what we could do about the quarry, about the limeworks.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.420
We then went for a brainstorming session, which was up in the cycle centre up in Llandegna,

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:43.620
and we formed a committee, and from that committee we then decided that we were going to do our level

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:50.320
best to get it for the people of the community, for the community of Monera, for them to have it

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:59.200
as a facility for the whole area. Yes, as an outdoor general access.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.780
Many of the meetings went on in my house. Yes, yes. It was open house. We continued to meet,

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:18.940
we struggled, we really, really struggled very hard trying to get people to listen to us,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.620
and to agree to us doing, you know, having something done with it. Yes. And it was only

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.780
eventually when we managed to get the North Wales Wildlife Trust on board with us that we were able

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:40.560
to secure it for the people of the community and make it a facility rather than what was becoming

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:52.520
nice or a problem. Yes. So we, I then stepped down from being the chairperson, and it was taken,

00:02:52.660 --> 00:03:01.000
I've been a couple of chairmen after that. Yes. But I'm quite pleased to say that as a result of

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.540
the efforts that the group made, it wasn't just me, but the group. The committee was really good

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.460
and hard working. Absolutely. Yes. And met on a regular basis and we managed eventually to

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.660
get the Wildlife Trust on board and with their help and what have you. Yes. It's now a good.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:30.600
It is. It's a good local facility. Yes. And hopefully it's going to go on and be an even

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:40.380
better facility in the future. I think it's got such possibilities. It's such a brilliant area

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:47.820
and it's such a large area. Yes. That we could do all sorts of things there. I've still got lots of

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:54.320
ideas of things that could be done. But we've met a lot of people, we've had a lot of important

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:01.280
people that have come up and looked at the area. Yes. Yes. And have all said, you know,

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.200
what a wonderful area it is and what a wonderful thing that we should do, that we were doing to

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.880
actually try and save it for the community. Because there's the industrial. Archaeology.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:23.600
And there's the general wildlife anyway and there's

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:36.400
the nearness for the community. Yes. And even if they don't walk the mile and a half to get there,

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:45.680
so we need car parking space there. They're still, they don't know how many miles they walk

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.800
once they're in. Absolutely. Absolutely. Yes. Yes. They, you know, it's a place of entertainment.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.560
It's a place of learning. Yes. It's a place of education. It's a place of

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:08.370
leisure. Yes. People just go there leisurely. They walk their dogs. They do all sorts of things

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:16.810
within it. And I think that we've managed to do something really worthwhile in ensuring that it's

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:23.870
going to be the captain, hopefully, for many, many years to come. Yes. It will be used by the

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:31.630
community. Yes. With local open access for everyone. Yes. I do meet people now when I'm up there.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.510
I do find that some of them now, we do have Welsh speaking people going up there quite often.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:45.730
Going back years ago, most of the people that were up there were Welsh speakers. Yes. Most of

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.950
the quarry workers would have been speaking Welsh, singing Welsh on their way back. They would be.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:58.130
Yes. But now, for a long time, it's been a lot of English speaking people and now it seems to be

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.970
going full circle. And we seem to be having a lot of Welsh people up there and, you know, taking

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:12.050
more notice. We do have lots of foreign people coming as well. Yes, we do. Yes. Yeah. So,

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:18.770
I don't know if I can extend that. So, thank you very much, Shirley. You're very welcome. Very

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:24.510
enjoyable to talk to you today and for you to come and meet us. Thank you.
