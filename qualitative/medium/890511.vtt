00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420
But I love it. I've been here 56 years now.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.000
56.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:05.800
Same as me.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.580
Same as us.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:07.860
I love it.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.200
I wouldn't move from here though.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.760
Oh no.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.620
No I wouldn't.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.780
I love badness.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.720
I love badness.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.140
And when I hear people saying about badness.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.600
Oh I got that.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.460
And I get it.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.780
It's such a bad thing.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.900
I get it.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.440
Well it's better than duck rig.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.680
Well when I'm black.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.100


00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.940
Everyone got their bat and couldn't.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.440
Yes.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.340
In lonely states.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.800
You shouldn't do that.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.540
You shouldn't run anything down.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.540


00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.980
In the spa room.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.120
In the spa room.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.860
There was people at work there that came from bettas.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.460
And if you heard them you'd never think they came from bettas.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.740
No.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.860
Oh everything is bad about bettas.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.600


00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.320
And if you want.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.460
I say hang on a minute.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.020
Hang on.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.660
I do.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.240
Stand on the lane and watch the children.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.680
The majority of them go at malpus.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.540
That's what I say.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.780
So don't come here saying about bettas.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.940


00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.580
I won't have it.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.880
No.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.240
Well they got bad and good everywhere.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.980
That's right.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.520
Yeah.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.160
The bench pass.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.960
The hush pass.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.080
Everyone did.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.520


00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:03.880
You shouldn't do that.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.760
No you've got your good and your bad everywhere.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.640
Don't care what they say.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.900
That's it.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.020
Anyway.
