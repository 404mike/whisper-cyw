WEBVTT

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:09.260
Good afternoon, we're here this afternoon with Mr. Brian Quinlan, who is one of the

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:19.340
longest attending gardeners at Stackpole Wall Garden. And we're interviewing him today,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:28.400
which is the 2nd of February 2023, and this is part of the Citizen Curator Project, an

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.600
oral history project, because people that have been working here, and certainly very

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.560
few for as long as Brian, are able to tell us so much more about the gardens. So I'm

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.600
working this afternoon with Julian Rollins, my colleague here, who is the tutor at Stackpole,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.460
so I'm going to hand over and then we're going to have a bit of a chat. Okay, Julian.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:00.340
Thank you, yeah. Thanks for giving us your time, Brian, because it's a busy day, isn't it? When

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:08.240
were you born, Brian? When? When were you born, what year? 1939. Is that current now? Yeah,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.040
so that's just as the war, the Second World War, was started. When the war was started, yeah. Where

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.840
were you living then as a child? Where did you live as a child? Outside Tempe, Comperson.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:32.460
Comperson, near Tempe, so you were... But the farm was down in the valleys. We had to go through a gate and then walk down to the farm.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.980
And your dad was the farmer? Yeah, my father was. Yeah. Was that Astridge, or what was the name of

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:49.480
that farm? Can you remember the name? No, a long time ago. No, no, gosh. So when you were small,

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:57.960
were you helping out around the farm then? Yeah. What did they used to have you doing? What? What did your dad used to ask you to do?

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:08.500
I knew he was on the tractor and horses ploughing with horses. Then I went on the tractor after that.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:19.220
What age were you when you were driving the tractor? I don't know. Small? 9 or 10. That was quite something to have a tractor

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:28.140
then, because I remember my father telling me, you know, it was mainly horses, wasn't it? Quite a thing to have a tractor.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.500
Yeah. Can you remember what tractor it was? The Fordson Major, small one, before they had the blue ones.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:48.680
What colour would a Fordson be then? Blue. The big one, yeah. So you, from a very young age then, you were working outdoors,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.500
doing outdoor stuff? I was walking around with my father when he was ploughing, and with the tractor.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:04.840
Yeah. And you remember the name of any of the horses? We had two. Did you? Brown one with a white face.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:12.200
And they used to use horses here at the garden, didn't they? Before we were all around. There's a photo, isn't there?

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:20.440
Yeah. So when did you, can you remember when you first came here then, Brian? First came to Stadpole?

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:30.120
I think when I went to the Anchorage first, I think. Any idea what year that was? No.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:40.820
So you're, how old are you now? You're 83. Three. Gosh, yeah. 84 Monday week. Oh really? Oh. Did that go on there then?

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:53.360
Yeah. 84 Monday week. And so what did you do between sort of finishing at the farm? Were you working other places or?

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.140
I went to the Gulf Refinery then. Oh, right, right. And I grew up working in the canteen.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.640
Ah, so they love you in the kitchen if they hear that here. Yeah.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.760
So you think, would you have been around 50 when you started working here or older?

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:26.140
I'm not sure, a bit older probably. A bit older, yeah, yeah. About 20 or so years ago probably, I suppose.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:37.040
That's when, yeah, things really got going here. Is there anyone else here now who was here when you first came?

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:49.780
I can't remember. No, I don't think so. No, no. No, so you really are the one that, you know what's what then, yes. Okay.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:57.760
So you said to me a little earlier that when you first came here, the garden was in a bit of a state.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:07.100
Overgrown, yeah. What was it like? What was growing in here? A lot of nettles and brambles and trees.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:16.840
Trees? Yeah, small trees, big trees like that. Wow. From the gate, you couldn't open the gate, it was,

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.720
well you opened the gate but it was full of brambles and nettles so we had to clear it all down.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:32.620
Wow, so it was like clearing a jungle. Yeah. So that, was that the first job then, just cutting your way in?

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:39.320
Yeah. How would, how did you do that? What sort of tools did you use, can you remember?

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:51.280
Saw, secateurs, clippers. No power tools, no strimmers back then? I can't remember, I don't think so.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.100
And was there a big gang of you then or was it just three or four? A few of us.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:08.920
Oh. And was Mr. Bateman here then or? Yes, George Bateman. George Bateman, ah right.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.540
He was the head gardener then.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.840
And did you see many members of the public in those days, were there many visitors?

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.980
Yeah, I think it was a few walking around. Right.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:40.640
So once the place had been cleared, was the, were there the area that is now vegetable beds,

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:48.080
was that the first bit that was cleared? Yeah, we worked on them then, do them over.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.320
And were there, was there a greenhouse? Was there a greenhouse?

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.320
Yeah, there was, but I wasn't near it then. Oh right, okay.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:09.480
So you, do you remember that first sort of spring or whatever planting, was it, you know,

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:15.140
quite something to fight, make enough space to do your planting? Yeah.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:23.640
What do you remember about that? Digging and, did you choose what to plant then? Yeah.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:31.740
What did Mr. Bateman tell you? Was it, who was making the... Digging in the tunnels,

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.120
or the tomatoes.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:44.160
So that was when you got the tunnels underway, was it? Yeah. Just out here or? Yeah. Yeah.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.840
So you grew tomatoes from an early, early stage then? Yeah.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:58.480
Oh right. And what else were you growing back then? Hmm? What else were you growing back then?

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:07.040
Can you remember? Tomatoes. Yeah. Onions, leeks, potatoes.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:07.680
Hmm.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:20.760
And was there, did you have that little tractor, was there a little tractor back there?

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.980
Yeah, we had a small, a small, a small tractor.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:32.180
Was it the same as the one you'd had at home? No. No? Small, grey one.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:38.300
But you felt sort of okay about the tractor, obviously. Yeah. Yeah.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:47.220
And did you, how many times a week then did you come? Was it just once a week or?

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.980
I think it was when we was clearing the garden.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:09:01.080
Hmm. And what was your general feeling? Did you, you know, want to come back?

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.660
Did you find it satisfying to work here? Yeah.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:14.460
In what way then? Was it more like going back to your roots sort of thing? Yeah. Yeah.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.760
Did it remind you of when you were a child on the farm?

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:25.560
No. No. The tractor and stuff, there wasn't? Yeah.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:32.000
So with the, with the crops you were growing then, you were growing onions, potatoes, leeks,

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:36.700
tomatoes, where, where did all of that produce go to?

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:46.000
You know, they used to take some veg into the shop in Ivory West. Oh, right. Next to the one,

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:57.580
next to the, the pub, I think. What was the name of that? Spar. Oh, yeah. In, in Bridge Street in

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:04.400
Halford West or? No. In the town. Next to the King's Arms. Oh, right. There you are. Yeah.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:12.320
There was a shop there and they used to buy veg, obviously. And I think you live in Halford West

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:23.060
now, don't you? Were you living there then? When I was here? No. No. I see. Because the charity

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:30.100
Pembrokeshire Mencap was originally started off in Halford West, so I guess that's probably the

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:40.600
link for selling the vegetables over there, isn't it? Yeah. Did you know Ian or, you know Ian that

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:48.040
comes down? From the committee. Yeah. Did you know him then? Was he here then? I can't remember.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:56.140
I think he was. Probably did overlap, I should think. Yeah. Yeah. We can hear the blasting in

00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:01.360
the background. That's the, the military, isn't it, down on Castle Martin? You get used to that

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:05.720
noise, don't you? Yeah. On the ranges. It's part of life here, isn't it? Listening to the,

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:14.400
the guns going off. So, so you were, you would have been coming once a week then?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:23.120
Yeah, I think so. How did you get here? On the van. On a van, yeah. Like a minivus. Yeah. Yeah.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:28.900
With other people who were coming to work. Yeah. Who would be doing the driving then back then?

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:34.620
George, the basement, I think. George would come and pick you up. What sort of time of day?

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.720
Half past nine in the mornings. And then you'd be here for a whole day, would you? Yeah.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:48.680
Putting the day's work. You bring your dinner with you then, did you? Yeah. Yeah, you bring your lunch, yeah.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:57.020
Yeah. Were there women in those days? Any women on the bus? I think so. Yeah, like today, a little bit

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:05.140
of a mix. I've just seen Jane there in the, in the greenhouse today. Yeah. Yeah. Did you take vegetables

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:11.160
home after you'd grown them? Did you have your own plots in those days or was it more? No. No,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:20.920
it was more general. Yeah. I see. I was going to, you'd mentioned lunch, hadn't you? So when you

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:35.120
had, you bought a pack lunch in with you. Yeah. Where did you eat it in those days then when the

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:43.620
makes the tea? The corrugated iron shed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You'd have tables and chairs and

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:56.240
electric fire in there. Quite cosy. Yeah. You've seen a lot of changes, Brian. You know, a lot of

00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:01.870
change over the years. Yeah. How does it feel? Is that good or bad?

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:04.810
Couldn't be bad.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:15.330
You're a good advert for it. You've kept fit, haven't you? Yeah. You kept fit. Do you enjoy that,

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:22.870
you know, that physical work is good, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. So what is it you're working on today,

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:34.190
Brian? We're digging the sides out. We're going to put the Maipax on top, tuck it in to the trench

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:41.490
then and then put it back in. Right. So is that this? And it'll hold the Maipax down. This is the

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:49.970
stuff that the strawberries will go underneath? Yeah. Yeah. We make holes in the Maipax and plant

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:59.190
through like the tomatoes. So you're establishing a new strawberry bed, isn't it? Yeah. And is that

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:06.270
good? Cos do strawberries, does it need to be sort of refreshed every? Yeah. Tell us a bit about that.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:12.690
They grow better then. Do they? When they're replanted with a Maipax. Yeah. And Maipax is like

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:19.650
this sort of film, like it helps to stop the weeds, doesn't it? Yeah. And is it particular

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:26.310
strawberries? Do you grow El Santa or strawberries do you grow? Do you know? Any kind then.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:32.930
They're quite early though, aren't they? Cos they come, I always seem to think they come quite early

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:39.870
here. Yeah. And have people always come to pick the strawberries? Do you remember people doing

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:48.070
pick your own in the past? Yeah. I think they grow better when they're in the Maipax.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:54.970
Do they? Why is that? Cos the birds gets at them when they're loose and some goes bad.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:03.530
So we get Jays coming in and stealing them don't we? Yeah. Little devils. Had you garden before

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:10.730
coming here? Had you gardened at home at all or in the past? No, only when I was on the farm.

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:20.170
Right. I didn't roach. Used to drive a tractor then. Were you working there then? Yeah, living in.

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:31.930
Right. And they always grew some spuds did they? Yeah. In the field then? Yeah. And hay and

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:42.630
straw. All right. Did you enjoy working there? Yeah. Well there. Yeah, it was all right. Yeah,

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:49.290
it was all right. So you came here with a lot of experience. You knew what was what sort of thing

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:59.550
in terms of the tractors and gardening and what have you. Yeah. Do you think that coming here and

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:04.250
the work you're doing keeps you fit? Yeah.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:12.030
Do you ever, if you ever see the doctor, does he tell you you're a fit? You're doing well? Yeah,

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:18.670
I saw two not long ago. Lady doctor, she was going to test my legs but she said there's no need

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:25.510
because I was fit. Oh well done. She'll check my toes and said they're fit. That's in case you get

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:30.790
diabetes isn't it? Yeah. She said you get a small stand and put your feet up

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:37.290
rather than down because it helps the veins in when your feet is up.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:44.630
But she thought you were pretty good. Well it's bound to be. You're moving a lot during the day

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:50.970
and I would imagine that helps then. Yeah. What's your favourite job here then, Brian?

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:54.870
Here? Yeah. No, anything.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:00.970
Raking, digging, planting.

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:13.670
And is this a good time of year now? Yeah. I always think of you planting spuds, well not yet, but

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:20.290
when will that be? A month's time? It's just the beginning of February now, is it March?

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:25.750
Depends on the weather, does it? Yeah, March, April, May.

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:31.790
Do you do first earlies? Yeah, we have done.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:38.490
They're quite popular with people aren't they? Do people quite like

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:42.510
to come and buy the first new potatoes? Yeah.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:49.190
Yeah. You must have grown many pounds of spuds over the years. Yeah.

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:54.850
What would you say your favourite time of year was then?

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:59.310
What would you say your favourite time of the year here is then?

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:11.940
Planting. Is it? In the spring? May, April or May, March.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:22.700
It's a nice pace of life. Yeah. You can't force nature. No.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:36.880
Shall we pause it there? Yeah. Pan? Just have a breather. Get the red light on again.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:46.120
So continuing then Brian, you've got your own, everybody has their own veg plot.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:52.040
Vegetable plot, yeah. What are you going to grow on yours this year then?

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.800
Probably potatoes.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:00.060
Anything else?

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.180
Beetroot plot.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:16.880
So you get some produce from that. Yeah. What do you usually do with what you grow then?

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.220
Where does it go to? It takes it home then.

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:25.140
And do you cook it yourself? Stuff. You've got?

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:29.660
And then we eat it then. Support workers will cook it for you. Yeah.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.200
Do you share it with the people that you're living with then? Yeah.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:38.860
That's good. What do they think? Do they say good things about it? Nice.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:46.900
Do you think a potato that you grow yourself takes better than one you buy in a shop?

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.580
Yeah, sometimes.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:56.960
Do you find it varies from year to year depending on the weather? Yeah.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:01.580
Have you ever had blight in spots down here? Yeah, but I don't know.

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:08.360
That's a helper thing, isn't it? Yeah. It flattens them, doesn't it? Yeah.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:16.680
And what's the worst pests you get down here then? Do you get a lot of slugs or snails or what's the worst?

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.720
Sometimes. Yeah.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:25.680
So what was last year like? Because it was a very hot summer, wasn't it, last year? Yeah.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:31.420
Did the produce, did you manage to grow potatoes last year? Yeah, they looked all right.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.520
Any particular brand? Maris Piper or? Yeah.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:46.200
Rocket? Yeah. A few of the different types, does it? Yeah.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:51.880
Good. And would you wish you still were going around with a horse?

00:20:52.740 --> 00:21:00.740
Do you wish you were still ploughing with a horse? No. No. They walked a long way in those days. Yeah.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.940
So what's happening at the moment then out there?

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:13.320
Anything changing at the moment? Pardon? Is there anything changing at the moment? There

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:18.160
seem to be new beds appearing in different places. Yeah. What's going on?

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:27.200
Grapevine. Oh, yeah. Getting ready for the grapevines. What do you think of that?

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:35.360
Should be good. It's different, isn't it? Interesting, isn't it? Yeah.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:44.420
Yeah. It'd be good the day we can all sit down and enjoy a glass of wall garden wine, wouldn't it?

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:50.140
That'd be all right. Yeah. That'd be the day. Yeah. Yeah.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:55.620
Well, you're pretty keen to get back to your strawberry bed, I understand.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:01.600
Well, it's sunny. Yeah. So shall we stop it there and then we'll maybe

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:09.100
come back to you in the future with a few definite questions? Yeah. Yeah. Maybe when

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:14.320
some of the things that you're just planting now, we could talk to you about them. Yeah. Well,

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.460
you know, when you start planting it later in the summer and ask you a bit about those.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:20.720
Thank you, Brian. Thank you, Brian.
