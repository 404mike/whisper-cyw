00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
It worked like this, when you were married,

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.480
and you had a boy coming up to Colery status at 13,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.720
then you were leaving school,

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:20.140
you would get knowledge of one of the men

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.060
about the village, went to the Workman's Institute,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.140
which was just coming into vogue,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.300
or about the football field,

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.680
you want a boy underground, you want a boy.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.680
Then you go and see that man, ask him,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.840
could you come to work with him underground,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.240
and write who he'd fix up with,

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.000
the officials of Colery, who just signed on,

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.920
and away to go.
