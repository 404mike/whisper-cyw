At home we had no television in 1953, but I had an uncle who lived in Trialo which did

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:14.080
So I can remember that we went to Trialo on the day of the coronation to actually try and view it because again

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.340
The quality of picture wasn't very clever. It was all in black and white very crackled

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.600
so I can vaguely remember that and remember it because

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:34.840
People's opinion were quite different in those days and I suppose that a lot of the family were ex-service people

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.780
So at the age of four I could sing the sort of national anthem

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.100
Especially for that particular day I suppose so yeah, I do remember the coronation

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.800
What was the atmosphere like to remember anything of that?

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.800
In addition to being able to see it on television of course there were street parties

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.300
There were street parties and there was lots of decorations

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.820
And different streets did different things I remember in the Sear Road where I lived of course we couldn't decorate it was the main road

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.060
But one of the sites is there Witton Street in particular was highly decorated and they put on this

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.020
Magnificent play of theirs and they used the Catholic Church hall in the Sear to do it

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.940
And it was it was funny to see people of all ages taking part everybody got involved

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.440
A really truly sort of local community spirit in those days truly different to what it is nowadays
