00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880
Yes, can you please introduce yourself please?

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.880
My name is Raqel Smith.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.100
Mera naam Raqel Smith hai.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.380
Can you tell us where you were born and yeah, can you tell us about what it was like growing up there as well?

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.860
Mai Pakistan mein baida hui, Jannamwala, Nasti, Faisalabad ki.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:38.320
I was born in Pakistan, Jannamwala, near Faisalabad, district Faisalabad.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.960
What was it like growing up there?

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.860
It was very nice. We had a small family.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:03.940
My father was in England. He was in army first and then he came to England to work.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.860
While I was with my mother, grandmother and brother.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.600
So we were living there happily.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.860
How old was you when your father was travelling to England?

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.040
We came to this country when I was fourteen.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.080
What kind of games did you play in Pakistan?

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.080
I remember playing in the streets, sort of an open place.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.520
Because even in the houses we have a yard where we play to get the children to come around.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.840
And we played in the streets as well.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.360
In our time it was very safe to play there.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.540
Have you got a favourite memory of your childhood?

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:20.460
My favourite memory could be my grandmother being there and friends coming around to play.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:29.460
And we used to sit together, listen to grandmother's stories and having good fun really.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.080
Because there was no TV, only radio at that time.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.800
Is there a certain story you can remember from your grandmother?

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.000
Not really. Only remember just talking about different things.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.900
Is there an event or gathering that really stands out to you that you had while you were still in Pakistan?

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.900
I remember Christmas times, because I'm Christian.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.800
So Christmas time was a big thing.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.900
And because my father was abroad we were known as a well-off family.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:27.020
And he would send money and Christmas time all the people in our nearby would get together in our house.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.020
And little presents would be given to them and it would be a really joyful time.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.580
Mixing with children. And it wasn't a massive big presents.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.200
It was small presents and some food given and things like that.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.520
So we weren't spoiled about giving of large big things.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:58.260
So then you're 14 years old and you're travelling to the UK. What made you decide to come to the UK?

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.000
It was my father invited us over. The mother, my brother and myself.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.200
It was hard in a sense. Mother was very excited. She's meeting her husband and going abroad.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.680
I don't understand why I wasn't happy.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.380
Because I was leaving everything I knew behind. I think all the aunty, uncles, all the friends behind.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.060
But it was good as well. Happiness as well.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.080
But still you were sad as well deep down living in the country.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:47.060
Was there anything you were expecting? Did you have a vision inside your mind of what the UK was going to look like?

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:57.800
Not really, no. Being 14 years old it was quite hard to just think why we have to leave and go.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.320
And when we came here, going to the school was the biggest thing.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:12.900
I didn't know the language. Even though I went to school in Pakistan, I only moved to India.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:21.560
We just started doing English at my age. We started in class 6 I think.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:33.000
We started English. And then I knew to read and write, but to speak there was no chance.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:42.440
Especially when you can speak when you come here, accent and everything. It takes time.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.680
So that was a big culture.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.040
So you travelled by plane coming to the UK?

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.020
Yes, we came by plane.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.840
Can you remember where you landed?

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.740
Heathrow. Straight to Newport.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.220
And been in Newport over 50 years now.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.780
Wow. That's amazing. Was there any particular reason why your father was in Newport?

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:26.640
He was actually in Bradford because he had friends there and there were more industrial factories around there.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:35.000
But he had a friend from Genoa where we were from, in Wales.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:41.180
And he invited him over from Bradford. He said, come and join us here. Now your family is coming.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.860
Come here so we can meet together. So that was the reason.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:59.080
And of course, is there a certain memory that really sticks out to you when you arrived into Newport or around the time that you were settling in Newport?

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:06.960
Yes, there are a lot of memories. The particular one is changing of clothes.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:19.800
From Pakistani clothes we had to wear English clothes like in school, skirts and things. That was very daunting.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:30.960
It was very strange after being covered, we had to wear those clothes. That was one of the memories that really sticks out.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.880
That's something. That's the first time I'm hearing that actually, someone mentioning that.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:43.700
Because you wouldn't think as much how clothes do pay a factor because that's what you're wearing at home.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.760
That's what you're wearing when you play everywhere. Everyone in Pakistan is coming here.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:56.560
It's not everyone. It's just my father was a thing who got mixed with the culture.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:04.200
And being a Christian, we didn't have restrictions like got to be covered.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:12.360
Even though in Pakistan there was no difference. That's what you call national costume.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:22.680
Here to him, national costume was what English people were wearing. Got to be with the society.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.280
So when did you start learning more about the language?

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.020
I went to school here. So I started learning the language there.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.880
There were special classes and there were Pakistani children as well.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:48.800
With the teachers I would communicate small words by writing down and answering back written down.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.800
They would write down for me. There was no other help around.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.900
So how about friends? Did you start growing friends as well or more that you have been settled in the side of Newport?

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:07.960
Yes, we made friendship. My main friends were Pakistani people because of the language.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:16.800
And some of them are still my friends. We kept on as family friends after.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.600
Where in Newport have you lived actually? Since you've been here for 50 years.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.320
I live around the hand post area, you know, Rusker Road.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:39.140
We moved around a bit. I think the very first time we came, the first home was in Thill.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:44.980
My father was there and from there we moved to Mendy. We lived in Mendy a year.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:50.880
And then the rest of my life I've been in the hand post area, up and down streets.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.480
You're actually quite high up now actually going up the hand post.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.040
Does that mean that you used to go to Bellevue Park and things like that as well?

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:08.960
Yes, I lived in Bellevue Park and still do. It's one of the things, really memories are there.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.920
Because from school we would walk to Bellevue Park before we go home.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:21.520
I went to Dufferin High. Bellevue Park is quite an important park in my life.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:31.600
After coming here, did any of your friends from Pakistan or other family members join you in Newport?

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:39.020
No. Because it wasn't easy to get visas and things.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:46.200
How about you travelling to Pakistan? Have you been able to?

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:53.920
My mum and my husband used to go more often. My husband doesn't come yet.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:02.680
He came too early. When I got married I went back. I did not go before that.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:13.400
Yes, we got a big connection at this moment in Pakistan. We started a charity in a village nearby where I'm from.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:19.080
Which is running a school for poor children in a small village.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.240
And they needed a church as well so we built up a church.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:29.560
School is our responsibility. I got all the community here involved in it.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.420
It's good really well. We got a big connection there.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:39.940
We go up and down and with the media now we run the video calls.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:49.340
So it's really important. When I was young I didn't have that connection.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:55.360
Only stories I will get is when mum will go back or my husband will go back.

00:11:60.000 --> 00:12:02.320
But now I've been a few times.

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.440
What does that connection feel like for you to have now?

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.960
It's that connection you didn't have when you were younger.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.600
What does it feel to have that now and to also provide it for other people?

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.560
It is really satisfying the connection.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.940
It's keeping in touch with your roots.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.980
Plus we're trying to change lives of people.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:30.920
We've got a good life here and those children did not have any education, no school.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:38.620
And it is really satisfactory that you can make a change in people's lives.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:44.240
When we were asked to do something for the village,

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.180
I'm not from the village or my husband is not,

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:54.140
it was just a pastor who reached us and asked us if we can help.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.160
Because they think people living abroad are rich and they can do anything.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.540
But we said we will go back and find out and let you know.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:09.020
So we took up this responsibility and God is always there to help us through.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.400
Because fundraising is not a easy job.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.360
And we are getting there and we got the building which is really lovely.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:24.540
And children seeing their behaviour running around from the street to being here,

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.240
sitting down to get some education, this we're changing.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:34.020
For the country, these children and changing their families,

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:38.420
it's a really satisfying project.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:46.240
And like I said, all my friends, everybody I know is always willing to help.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.380
The fundraising, anything they can do, it's always there.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:58.020
It's amazing to hear and that togetherness that you just mentioned of your friends

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:03.000
and people that are around you here, they're also assisting you in fundraising.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.320
This is without any religion, without any restrictions.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.900
We are just friends. We try to work for this community.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:19.680
And speaking of work, what type of jobs have you had while you've been here in Newport?

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:28.100
I have worked in shops, like shop assistants.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:34.120
I think little time in the factory as well, the production factory.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:42.560
But my main job has been in school as a language support worker and an under-five development worker.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:47.720
And I think that's where my real heart is to see children progress.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:56.400
And get into life. Education is the only way, I believe, to change people, to give you progress.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:02.760
And I've done a lot of work. Since I retired, I'm a voluntary worker.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:11.600
And can you tell us a bit more about your family in terms of your husband,

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:17.360
and how that came about, and then growing up from there as well, in terms of you being married?

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.720
Yes, I was married at the age of 31.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:27.660
And it was arranged, married.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:35.180
And we have lived happily since then. It's 47 years now.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:43.360
We've got three girls who are very successfully educated and settled in their life.

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:50.240
And six grandchildren. It can be helpful when they're together.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:16:01.500
So then balancing your work and family and being in this environment as well,

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:07.460
what kind of other things in terms of groups or anything like that did you start being exposed to?

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.360
Or did you start joining any groups while you were here in Newport?

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.780
Basically I joined the groups when I retired.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:28.580
I was looking for a way to go, what to do. I started going to coffee and laugh at Eaton Road.

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:33.880
And from there a friend, Sugra, introduced me to Age Alive.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:51.620
And Age Alive is a very successful, very friendly, satisfying, it's like a family group now.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.460
Because I've been going to it till about ten years.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:17:00.900
So I can make up places. And I'm a secretary for the group.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:08.640
Once you're with Age Alive, you always got a job there. They get you to do everything.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:17.720
Roy who runs Age Alive is a person who gives his 100% to it.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.800
And he expects everybody else to give their life to it.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.800
But I do try my best and try to do what I can.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:37.460
But it is a group that everybody should join. It's so satisfying.

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:41.820
It's given people a home. Like some people go nobody.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:46.900
Once they join Age Alive, you've got a family there.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:52.880
We were really friends with everybody. Everybody's willing to help.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:00.700
Fantastic. Thank you. Thank you very much. I don't know if there's anything else that you would like to share at all.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.920
That's all really. Yeah.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.540
Fantastic. Thank you very much.
