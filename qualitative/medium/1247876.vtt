00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.980
Originally I did but after so many miss apps I've had, you know what, Lover First Sight

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.640
can go sling one.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.960
I do believe in Lover First Sight.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:27.320
Just because of love is another part of either friendship or relationship as well, that it

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:35.140
can bring a positive outcome in someone and you can help them to be loved and be secure

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.040
and comfort.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.720
But you can do that in friendship as well, put it in a different manner.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.920
Love can be either relationship or be a family member or something.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.600
I think it was hard for me when I was younger because I probably didn't believe it when

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.220
I was younger.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.100
But as you get older you do because you kind of feel more as part of life then.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.200
I think you realise that you need someone in your life probably to feel that way.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.560
I thought I felt Lover First Sight probably about a few years ago when I started my college

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.620
because that's why college was perfect for me because I knew that getting a girlfriend

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.220
half and half.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.360
I had a couple of girlfriends in there but they lived quite far away.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.380
Finding love as well at first sight is hard.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:50.600
I generally thought Lover First Sight, when I was going through primary school up in the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:58.000
Maybe seven relationships in total but the one that I don't think you met or you might

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.460
have was Jess.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.340
Yes, that was a couple of years ago.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.720
That's when I was living with her for seven months.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.300
That's when I generally thought it was Lover First Sight.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.480
As we've said, it's hard when you're happy and something bad happens to you that you

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.260
think, am I doing anything right or wrong?

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.480
I know and they won't even tell you.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.480
I'm lucky with mine.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:33.360
When I seen Kimmy in Pondy bus station back in January 2017, I looked at her but she kind

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.680
of looked down because I think she probably felt the same, Lover First Sight.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.280
We kind of knew there was something there so I think that's why we're still together now.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.420
I think my first reaction was, and they call it puppy love.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.560
Yes.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:59.620
I think some of those people are lucky when you have someone you love and you see them

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.280
first.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.140
That's definitely the girl.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.880
Sometimes part of life you might not be lucky, you might be just positive and say, go for

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.980
it.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.180
If not, it don't work out.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.440
There's plenty more fish in the sea as they say.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.220
Love is not a very powerful source for yourality.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:36.760
I think it's hard for you because of who you are to believe it.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.800
Believe it is.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:51.400
I thought at one point I grasped it and then out of the blue I was just like, nah, I haven't

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.080
grasped it.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.780
Still got to do a few tweaks year and May.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:04.520
I have been doing those tweaks but it just doesn't work as much as it was without the

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.820
tweaks.
