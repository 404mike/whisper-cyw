I mean they left Odessa in about 1903 as a result of her eldest sister

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.520
witnessing the beheading of her husband. It was a wretched scenario.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.120
Can you say more about that?

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:27.960
I will because it was part of my life as a child. Aunt Bella who was a very very

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.780
beautiful woman. I've seen photographs of her as a young woman and she was

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:40.540
strikingly beautiful. Had married a Cossack, a non-Jew who was apparently also,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.320
in fact I've got some photographs of their offspring in that book which you

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:53.320
will see later. And as the Cossacks did not want their people to

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:02.360
So to make an example he was beheaded in their cellar in front of her when she

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:09.160
was carrying Grisha who was then about five months pregnant she was and she

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.540
graphically told me the story of how and she spoke with a very Russian accent.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.160
They held his head and he had long beautiful hair and they had a

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.560
huge scimitar and the head came off and the blood went up to the ceiling all

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.900
over me. I was carrying Grisha. Little Lardle sitting on her lap aged

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:41.720
about five heard this story so many times I got used to it. It was quite

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.440
something. I think this was the final straw which said get the hell out.
