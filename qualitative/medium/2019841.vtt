What is your full name? Helen Lewis John. Do we have permission to record this interview?

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:21.900
Yes. Where and when were you born? Swansea in 1932. How did you meet Father Paul Sartore?

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:38.860
I received a letter in 1979 from a friend of my aunt Nels. I took it to work because I didn't have

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:48.040
time to open it and when I read the letter I was shocked and upset as Frances was because she

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:59.060
assumed that I had known about my auntie Nel dying and being buried and the fact that auntie Nel was

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:08.480
a very staunch Catholic and the fact that she had just been buried without the Eucharist, the Requiem Mass,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:20.780
that upset us very much, both of us. So the person I spoke with at work was a Catholic and attended the church

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:33.640
in Haverford West. So she took me down in our break to seek Father Sartore. So I showed him the letter and I did

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:43.720
explain to him that I was now a lapsed Catholic. There was no sense, he wasn't judgmental at all, he didn't

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:56.100
criticise or anything. He was very, very sympathetic, very, very kind and he said, I'll do my best to find out what happened

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:06.560
and I'll speak with you in a few days' time. Which he did. He actually rang his brother in Swansea who was also a priest

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:18.340
and he got the information from him and then when he rang me again he said that because I was no longer a Catholic,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:29.340
he wasn't allowed to give me a service in the church but he arranged for me to go to the little convent in Haverford West

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:46.840
and the mother superior there conducted the service and it was lovely. It made me, gave me the courage to say goodbye to my auntie Nel

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.400
who I loved dearly.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.380
So was that your earliest memory of Father Paul Sartore?

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:56.340
Yes.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.940
Did you ever meet him afterwards?

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.280
No, unfortunately.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.780
How would you describe him as a person? I know if you only met him once but what did he come across as?

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:18.820
He came across as a very kind, outgoing person and I would think, I don't know, that he would have had a lovely sense of humour.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.960
Can you think of, do you have any other stories of Father Sartore or did you have any other connection with him? Was it just that one incident?

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:49.240
That was just that one incident. But when the hospice was founded I made a donation, I got a direct debit and I make a monthly donation to the foundation.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.420
I feel that's all I can do to say thank you to him.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.940
That's marvellous.
