Do you think that television has had an effect on your use of leisure time over the years?

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:16.060
Oh yes, definitely, without a doubt. Yes. We do see we select the viewers, because quite often we don't

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.740
have television on until nine o'clock, but television does play a very important part in our lives.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.100
There's no doubt about it. I think it plays an important part in everybody's lives. I think anybody who says

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:32.740
it doesn't are kidding themselves, because when he knows I'm an avid news watcher, I must have the

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.220
six o'clock or ten o'clock news on, or when I knock on him, he's depressed.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.640
And of all the things that you've seen over the years, what has left the greatest impression on you?

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:55.460
Oh, it's got to be Mandela. We had the pleasure last year of Wounderbilly Slines, and we went up to

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.540
Robben Island. The moment we arrived there, Wend started crying, and didn't stop crying until we got

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:09.880
off, until we got back on the boat. And I wasn't far behind. That day when he walked free, oh dear me,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.060
that will be everlasting. And it's cemented now, because we've been there, and we actually went to the

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:23.760
cell where he spent all his years. We've had the background of all that he did, the background of all that

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.580
he stood for, all the things he refused, because they couldn't break him. And when we found out that they

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:36.580
offered him this, that and the other, he said, no, no, no, offer it to us all or nothing. The character of the

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.320
man. And because we've been there as well, it's just a stare now. And whenever you see that walk now, oh,

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.960
boy, oh, boy, it gets better and better. But there's another as well I think that had an impact, a similar

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:54.040
thing, great man, Jeff Kay. You know, the other time he got shot, we all knew where we were, I sort of knew

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:02.780
where I was. And that, as a teenager, had a very big effect, and I couldn't get enough of watching it,

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:10.660
because I never ever subscribed to the theory of the assassination. And we never know the truth. I'd love to,

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:18.300
but we never will. But that, again, the mystery surrounding it as well, has added to it. But the assassination of

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:28.060
Kennedy, as a teenager, oh, dear me, huge impact, huge impact. He was our hero. You know, a young man taking

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.000
charge of the world, assassinated, and then all the plots and counter plots that came after it kept the news

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.640
going for years and years, and then theories come out. So we've never lost it. Never lost it. And two great men.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.800
I think Mandela more than anything else, because our friend actually met him, and he got a photograph of his wall

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.220
with Mandela, so, and the greatness of the man himself.
