00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.780
I suppose I watched, I think when I was in the sixth form we did watch television in

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:10.920
the evening a little bit more because I didn't have the, I didn't do the amount of subjects

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:21.900
then, things eased off in the sixth form. But my viewing pattern, I think, well you

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.980
see I've moved about a bit. Now when I went to college we did have a television in the

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:40.260
college. And then when I went to work in Liverpool we did hire a television set, you know, on,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:50.300
what do you call it, on higher purchase, a DER it was, and do you know there were four

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.520
of us in the first year working there. And this girl, no when we went to the shop the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.420
man said to us, I know we asked him about that, and then when he realised we wanted

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:10.660
to have a television he wouldn't sell it, he wouldn't let us have it, and I said why?

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:18.040
He said you're too young. I said we're teachers. And he didn't believe me. They wouldn't sell

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.800
us. And do you know I also had somebody who wouldn't sell me the news of the world either.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.300
They said you're too young. This woman had, the papers weren't on the counter, they were

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:33.040
at the back. And this old lady wouldn't let me have the news of the world. That we must

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:40.340
have looked young. We must have done. Oh dear me. I wish that had happened now. Anyway,

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.820
the thing was, so yes we had this, eventually we did have a television from another shop,

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.500
DER it was, but I don't know that we watched a lot of television. I don't recall watching

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:02.400
programmes much on it except the news maybe. I remember on one occasion there was something

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.440
about the pill which was quite controversial at the time. I don't remember watching anything

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.740
much. I can't remember a programme, or coronation treat because my friend was, oh she's been

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:21.180
faithfully watching coronation treat for years. And so we did watch that. But I suppose we

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.420
went out more in those days. When you're younger you go out more don't you? And I was very

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:35.200
much in with a Welsh group in Liverpool then. And then I went to London and we had, we didn't

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:43.840
have a television there. But I was only there a term anyway. And then I came back to the

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.600
Wirral and yes I did have a television but not immediately. I did go out more in the

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.100
beginning. But then I had my own flat and I had a television there which was black

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.480
and white. Most people had black and white then. And I think I watched coronation treat,

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:09.640
I've always liked coronation treat, don't watch any other soap. And the news as well.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.620
So I've always been clued up to the news really. And I used to watch the golf and a horror

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:27.920
film on a Monday night. Not that I like horror films now. And sports, I love sports. I like

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:36.700
watching rugby. I like watching Formula One and tennis. I watched tennis there and we

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.820
used to discuss the games at school as well. Because in those days Wimbledon started about

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:49.560
2 o'clock was it? Yes so we finished work at 3 o'clock so we used to be rushing home

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.420
at that time because things were easing off then with summer term. It was nearly holiday

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.620
time wasn't it? And so to watch the matches. It was at the time when Chris Evert was in

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:07.020
a hay day and people like that. And, wait a minute, yes I remember watching those, I

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:14.200
think I suppose really I watched more television when I had my own flat. I know at home my

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.480
father used to like wrestling on a Saturday afternoon which I didn't so I didn't watch

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:37.000
that. Yes I suppose I was more aware of television in the 60s, 70s. And I've always been a fan

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:54.920
of TV. I'm a selective viewer but I do like certain things. I love historical drama and

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.860
things like silk. And another one I loved, well this was, I was still at school then,

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.920
they used to have a program called No Hiding Place. It was a detective thing but it was

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.900
lovely, a lovely program on a Sunday night I think it was. I think it was a Sunday night.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:21.800
And they had quite nice music to introduce it as well. Yes. And then in later years I

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.280
watched Van der Valk. Do you remember that? I'm probably talking about things you don't

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.420
know about. Van der Valk that was another television program based in Holland. And that

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:40.260
was very iconic music. Have you ever heard of that? Yes that's it. And yes there have

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:47.140
been some, I love documentaries if they interest me. And of course in later, well I'm sorry

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.040
now that Learning Zone is on in the middle of the night. Although I'm late, I'm late

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.600
up and it's too late, it's four o'clock or something. But it used to be on about midnight

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.540
at one time and I used to love watching some of that because it's quite educational.
