00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700
The two devolution campaigns, the first in 1979 and the second in 1997, did you follow those debates on television?

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:17.180
I followed them as best I could, but to be quite honest I had very little interest in the first one.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.600
I didn't think we were ready for it and so it turned out. It was an almighty defeat.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.760
I think the majority of the Welsh people felt like I did, that perhaps the time wasn't right.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.140
And it was in 1979 wasn't it? Callaghan's government. Well he was ready to go anyway,

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.020
everybody knew that. So I thought, I think there was a bit of a backlash in that,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:50.780
with unemployment being quite high and his government likely to be kicked out if they

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.780
hadn't already been. I can't remember what month of the year it was, when was it?

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.500
It was March wasn't it? Well he was definitely in power then wasn't it, because the election was until

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.900
later with Marvin Thatcher. And I think it was a backlash because his government had

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.760
sort of pushed the idea or presented the idea, offered it. Most Welsh people decided no,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.580
we're not doing it. But of course when it came to 1997 there were different propositions altogether

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.800
by then, because in the meantime television had played their part in a big way. Margaret Thatcher

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:39.200
had united Wales in a sense, for the wrong reasons perhaps, but united it nevertheless.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.240
And therefore there was a growing feeling that perhaps Wales would be better off on their own

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.390
without the, I mean we've had to suffer the English for the last 800 years haven't we?

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.350
I like your, if they get a no vote today it'll carry on for a few long, much longer you know.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.430
Are you able to get home and vote or what? Yes. You are? Yeah. Oh you have to open until 10 isn't it?

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.330
That's right. Yeah I've got to go down later. No the, I think the, and I mean

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:19.090
in 97 they only just scraped through didn't they? 50 to 40, 50 point something to 49 point something.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:29.130
And it's strange really because Wales has always been a radical country, a country of radicals if

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:37.290
you like. Chartist movement and Quakers, non-conformists, Wesleyans, Methodists and so forth.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.890
I mean I'm Annie Bunworth, my father was a Wesleyan Methodist, my mother was a Baptist.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.890
Lots of my friends were Quakers. I mean America's built on Quakerism a lot of it.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.090
It started off, the Mormons were in the same type, from the same ilk, a lot of Welsh people were

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.850
So I think we were ready for some change and I think,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.330
I can't see that the Welsh Assembly has done any harm to be quite honest and a lot of good.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.950
I see Scotland are following Wales now with free prescriptions.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.970
So they must have done something right. There's always the feeling amongst the Welsh,

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.930
amongst the working class that MPs who've never done a decent day's work in their lives,

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.890
I'm quoting other people now, are all for what they can get out of it themselves. Well

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.470
that's unfortunate but it's because of the MP expenses which TB highlighted as well as the

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:49.890
newspapers that has caused people to be angry about things. So as soon as people nowadays like

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.390
the Welsh Assembly Ministers put forward an idea, Welsh in particular, they go,

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.810
what's he saying that for? What are they going to get out of it you see? And that's why people

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.050
are worried like my wife. What's it going to cost us if they get a yes vote you know?

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:17.710
But at the same time is it right that what we want to do in Wales should be governed by

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:30.250
people in England? What was, oh yeah, Trwydyn. Because I can remember Trwydyn and Capel Celyn

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:41.010
getting drowned and at the time it was evident that all 40 odd Welsh MPs had voted against it

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.770
and they were outvoted by their English counterparts because they were in the majority.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:53.730
What sort of a democracy was that sort of thing you know? When Liverpool could have got

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:04.010
their water from Cumbria, the wettest part of the United Kingdom, apart from Wales, and the irony

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:12.770
of it was that once they'd flooded Capel Celyn to create Trwydyn, there were houses overlooking

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.770
the reservoir who couldn't get water because Liverpool wouldn't supply pipe water to them.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:25.830
And oh my god you know, if we could cast ourselves adrift and float away like Ireland,

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.870
river between us or water between us, we'd be better off I think.
