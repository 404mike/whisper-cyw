00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.940
Next we come onto the Hunslet which was used underground to all supplies. It was used to take men underground. It would be bringing the men out. It would be fitted with a diesel engine. You couldn't fit a petrol engine. There'd be too much danger in gas.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:26.020
Diesel was totally enclosed and was quite safe underground, providing the exhaust was long enough and muffled.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:37.120
To your right there's a lump of steel that was a steam hammer. This came from Coignant Colliery to Blind Ant in 1968.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:50.460
When it was in commission in Coignant, the anvil that you see next to it would have been actually underneath the hammer and protruding through the oblong hole in the hammer.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:01:01.740
The hammer would have been steam operated. You see the steam engine on the left. This would have worked the hammer up and down for shaping large sections of steel.
