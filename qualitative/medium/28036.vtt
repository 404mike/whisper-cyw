00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140
Audio point two.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.060
From here you are able to sit and enjoy the view from the bench.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:16.720
Straight ahead and slightly to the right, perched on top of a smaller hill, is the hillfort of Mwyl a Gaer, Llambeder.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.560
Samantha Williams is the hillfort conservation officer for the Heatherner Hillforts project and is involved in the work on Mwyl a Gaer.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.820
She talks about what it may have been used for.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.380
From here you can see Mwyl a Gaer, Llambeder.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.360
Hillforts possibly have many functions. They are defended enclosures, so they are something that is defensive.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.260
They have massive banks and ditches which are called ramparts and they would have had a wooden fence on top called a palisade.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:56.320
So that does suggest that their aim was to keep people out, so possibly places that they retreated to in times of trouble and conflict.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:05.560
It could also be that they were sort of farming centres on top of the hill, a bit like a havoid site in the medieval times.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:18.540
So you turn your flocks out onto the hill during the summer, so they could be centres where those people collected their flocks when they needed to do shearing or something.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:28.220
Today our greatest predator is a fox, but in those days they had things like brown bears and wolves.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:35.680
We forget that they were massive creatures, so it could be to protect your stock from those animals as well.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.340
Also hillforts are on top of great massive hills and they are really obvious features within the landscape.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.480
So they could be centres that people could gather to to maybe celebrate births, deaths and marriages.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.980
Or for trading centres where they could trade goods with other Celtic settlements around in the area.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.640
So they could have many, many functions. We just don't know.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.340
Next, hear about the Bronze Age from Fiona Gill, Denbighshire County Archaeologist.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:17.440
As you're sitting on the bench looking out towards the Vale of Clwyd and admiring the view, just look slightly to your right and you'll see this heap of stones.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.140
Higgledy-piggledy heat doesn't look as if it's got much shape to it, but actually that's the remains of a Bronze Age cairn.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:33.280
Presumably originally it either had more stone there or was covered up with turf and earth and somehow that's become eroded.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.400
Possibly in the middle of there we've got a burial from 2000 BC, 4000 years ago.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.680
Maybe even some later cremations added into the mound.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:53.420
Difficult to imagine now from that heap of stones, but we've got to picture maybe a group of people coming up to bury their mother, father or whatever.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.180
And feeling much as we would at a funeral too.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.760
So we've got to try and put ourselves back in the shoes, if they wore shoes, of people in the Bronze Age.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:11.280
When you're ready, follow the path onwards until you reach Audio Point 3 on a wooden way marker opposite another bench.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.400
On your way you will catch your first glimpse of the Jubilee Tower in the distance.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:25.300
For additional information on hillforts from Samantha Williams, continue listening, otherwise hang up now.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.680
The features of a hillfort are that they have ramparts which are big banks and ditches.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.080
Some hillforts even have more than one.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:47.500
They also have interned entrances, so the banks turn into the entrance which would have been protected by a massive gate, so that made them quite a defensive structure again.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.860
On top of the ramparts we would have had a palisade which is a big wooden fence.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:00.000
And there would have been roundhouses within the hillforts as well.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:09.040
A roundhouse is a circular structure that's made of timber which would have had a thatched roof which would have gone pretty much to the floor to keep the walls dry.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:21.120
The walls would be made up of wachtlndorb which is hazel or willow that's weaved through stakes and then covered in daub which is a mixture of clay, animal dung and straw.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.360
Inside the roundhouse there would have been a central hearth, so a fireplace in the middle to keep everybody warm.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:37.560
That fire would have gone up into the thatch and that would have killed any bugs that was in the thatched roof and kept it nice and snug and warm inside.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.400
They could have also had meats and things hanging from the ceiling so it would have smoked the meat and kept it for the winter months.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:56.900
So it would have been a nice cosy structure inside the hillfort nestled in and could have been used possibly in times of retreat if the hillfort was a defensive structure.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.660
Or maybe during the summer months they might have lived up there in the summer months.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:10.640
The roundhouse comes in different sizes so there might have even been different functions for roundhouses, maybe somewhere like your garden shed is today.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:18.820
There is evidence for grain stores as well at Morlegai Rezesmo which is just off the Chluedian range outside our project area.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:26.040
They did a big excavation there and they found four post holes and a square in the ground and it's believed that these are grain stores.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:34.280
A squared structure raised off the ground that they would have put grain in to keep it and store it over the winter months as well.
