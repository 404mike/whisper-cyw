00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
Many of the children there at that time didn't go out at all. They were

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.540
never left the

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.700
hospital premises

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.160
So one of the things she did was to take them to

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.280
the swimming pool at Guildford Crescent

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.320
And this is gone now. It's a Chinese restaurant or hotel or something now

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.680
But she used to take them once a week down to the and that was the first time many of them had ever been out

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.500
It was a struggle to do because she used to have to go on the bus with her with the children and I used to go

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.820
with her and

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.280
used to come back on the bus and

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.800
And people in the public were sometimes

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.060
quite

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.400
Ruled but it was like as if they had never seen they hadn't seen people and

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.340
With learning disabilities out in the way that they were out with my mother
