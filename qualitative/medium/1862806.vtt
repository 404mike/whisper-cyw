Welcome to Mouth Off, a podcast brought to you by Forget Me Not Productions.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:13.480
My name is Clary Sadler and on today's episode I'm going to be talking about the iPlusMatter project,

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.600
which is a heritage lottery funded project conceived by T. Gwynn Special School in Cardiff

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.680
and inclusive arts organisation Forget Me Not Productions.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:32.420
iPlusMatter provided multiple opportunities for meaningful assistive technology experiences.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.400
These were interwoven with the arts and music was used as a motivator to enable individuals with

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:48.780
the most complex physical and cognitive disabilities to share their own history and celebrate their

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.980
independent achievements. The project was launched in February 2020 and was due to conclude in July

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.060
of that year. We were going to have a training event called iPlusMatter Festival and it was going

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:10.060
to involve professionals in the field of special education and social and health sectors. It was

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.220
also going to be a celebration of the achievements of all involved. The participants would use a

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:24.640
range of assistive technology such as eye gaze, switches and touch monitors in order to help them

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:33.640
achieve and independently take part in music and arts sessions. Due to Covid-19 the project was

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.940
postponed and we had to adapt the sharing event and the training event to fit a virtual platform,

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:47.120
pupils at five local special schools, adults from a local day centre and three individuals all with

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:54.220
complex needs took part in assistive technology and inclusive arts sessions called MusicCan.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.320
MusicCan is a protocol developed by Forget Me Not Production and it uses music primarily as a

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.600
motivator to engage individuals with the most complex needs in assistive technology. T. Gwynn

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.560
with the project lead and other partners included My Sebu Special School, Trinity

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.800
Fields Special School, Park Lane Special School, Gadliss Day Centre and three private clients that

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.180
had all worked with Forget Me Not Productions in the past. Most of the face-to-face MusicCan sessions

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:36.700
had resumed by the end of 2021 but sadly due to ongoing Covid-19 restrictions Trinity Fields

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.900
Special School had to pull out. Luckily Askol Henvelin Special School stepped in and had the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.600
remaining sessions enabling us to wrap up the project. So what exactly do we mean by assistive

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.020
technology? Well for the purpose of this project we are using the term assistive technology to

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:03.220
include any specialist technology that enables access to a computer. So things such as switches,

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:10.940
touch monitors, eye gaze which is a computer that is operated by eye movements and these are linked

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.080
to specialist software for teaching cause and effect, choice making and beyond, augmentative

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:24.400
and alternative communication or AAC, specialist controls for wheelchair driving and access to

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:32.480
toys and play. So when eye gaze first became commercially available it was really mostly

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:39.180
suited for people who were already at a level of using AAC and perhaps were using AAC with

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:47.340
switches, switches being very effective but slow, slow and laborious. Another focus of iPlusMatter

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.520
has been to provide staff members with the opportunities to be trained in the implementation

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:58.260
of assistive technology systems for those with the most complex disabilities. Why do you think

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:05.360
projects such as this iPlusMatter funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund are so important for the

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.460
individuals that have been taking part from your school? Well assistive technology like we did have

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:17.140
eye gaze machines here but they were and they would come on and they'd be broken and they'd

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.660
obsolete. So it's only now that we've started to use the eye gaze because we've all returned

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:29.000
your project is brought to me and we're using one parent to set an eye gaze in so we're trying to

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.180
re-establish those and also we want to start training the staff and really to see what

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.540
opportunities we can use with the eye gaze. It's wonderful with your project because you can see

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.220
how well the children have responded to it and how much you really need that in our school.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.080
What have been the main benefits that you've seen from the individuals that have taken part

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.880
So to see how much they've progressed in the two weeks has been amazing. I think it's fantastic.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:02.300
When they get to experience technology and staff get to see what they're capable of by using that

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.220
technology which gives us infinite access to move forward with purchasing of ourselves and developing

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:15.120
those skills and pupils get to be able to be part of a project. Parents can share and see that

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.260
you can see what the children are working on and I know the way that our pupils have responded.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:26.840
They've been focused and they've really enjoyed it and I think music is such a wonderful access

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.360
for our pupils anyway. So it's just a wonderful way for them to be focused and to be able to get

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:40.840
into that niche and they are there. What are the main barriers for these individuals achieving

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.800
independently within a school or daycare setting? The challenge is they need more like

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:53.020
consistency constantly and they need more more technology things to come in for the children

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:59.720
to help them progress higher than where they already are. One of the main aims of the project

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.500
has been to empower individuals identified as experiencing profound and multiple learning

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:13.300
disabilities or individuals that have complex physical disabilities. These individuals use

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:19.220
assistive technology to experience independent achievement and throughout the project we use the

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:26.540
MusicCan framework to motivate engagement with this technology changing and shifting the focus

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:34.680
from disability to ability. When I started making music with Forget Me Not productions it changed

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:41.860
my life. Music transformed me. We hope to raise awareness also of the historical development of

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:47.940
assistive technologies and the potential impact for independent learning via new technologies

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:54.240
and new techniques. We speak to Mel Sadler about the history of assistive technology.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:00.780
But of course by far the biggest development for assistive technology particularly for those

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:07.800
individuals with the greatest cognitive impairments has been the development of eye gaze. So eye gaze

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:13.500
worked really well for that group of people straight away. But it took some time for eye gaze

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:19.740
to be suited for software to come out and be made available for people with more significant

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:26.360
intellectual impairments as well as their physical disability. But once software such as Look2Learn

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:33.340
sensory eye effects and some of the inclusive technology softwares became available for eye

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:39.460
gaze users it's really opened up a whole new world for that group of learners which is just

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:48.580
just amazing. And you see people making choices using eye gaze who I would have considered it

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:53.760
being very difficult to teach them to make choices using switches because using switches to make

00:07:53.760 --> 00:08:01.920
choices is a much higher cognitive load if that makes sense. Yet they can do it with eye gaze.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:10.240
We also talk to assistive technology guru Carol Thornett. Dr Carol Thornett has been involved

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:17.240
in the field of assistive technology since 1986. She was a pioneer in exploring the use of assistive

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:23.420
technology with individuals experiencing profound and multiple learning disabilities. In fact it was

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:28.680
Carol that developed the first mobility platform which was originally part of the Spastic Society

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:35.100
research project and had the aim of enabling children with cerebral palsy to explore mobility

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:41.260
when their peers were able to. With mobility we were trying to get children mobile at the same age

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:47.300
that their peers would be mobile since we extrapolated those with learning difficulties

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:54.320
and physical difficulty obviously as well. But initially it was just a physical difficulty.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:01.920
That proved to be really exciting and I think it's quite sad now that I see so few with independent

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:10.020
mobility. They should be in their usual seating because that was always such a problem if they

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:17.660
were to have a wheelchair service in that what seating would they use. So this was you know that's

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:22.060
really the reason why it was a platform that you could attach the whole seating system

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:28.540
so that you started by looking at whether they could control it and what they would do and

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:35.600
they stop and stop it as important as going so on. The historic Cragher Park school has also

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:41.760
been a heritage partner throughout the i-Plus-Matter sessions. Cragher Park House is a country house in

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:50.700
Pentirk, Cardiff. It was built in 1914 for a colliery owner named Thomas Evans. Evans died in 1943

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:56.900
and Cragher Park then came into the possession of the National Coal Board before being sold in 1954

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:04.760
to the Spastic Society. They opened a residential school site in 1955 and the house still operates

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:10.860
as a residential care facility today. It is also a special school for young adults with learning

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:17.180
disabilities which is operated by Salutum Healthcare. The school I work in is catered

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:23.980
for people with disabilities. Research the school you're going to work in and the students you're

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:30.820
going to work with and then it's just a case of getting to know your colleagues and then getting

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:41.540
to know you and that should make your job hopefully a lot easier. That was one of the first

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:50.540
things people used to look at and say. Last time probably a student but that doesn't happen anymore

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:55.800
because I'm older and I grow beards and stuff like that so that tends not to happen anymore.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:06.200
Well my powered wheelchair it can well the batteries last longer which means I can stay out

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:14.600
for longer I can socialize for longer and be in work for longer and secondly my power chair then

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:22.960
can also so as you can see the chair the chair that I'm sitting in is actually right in

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:30.360
which then also helps me in my job professionally when I'm working with students with standing

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:38.860
frames who are in standing frame sorry and also helps me socially when there is no seating available

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:44.740
for other people I can then rise myself up to the level that the person is standing to

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:52.680
and then when I'm when I'm done you just go back down so it's basically far different now so

00:11:52.680 --> 00:12:00.760
used to be there's no comparison because now I can turn lights on using my voice

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:11.240
whereas when I was younger I wasn't able well I wasn't able to read I wasn't able to really

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:18.040
reach the light switches due to them being on a different level. What would you say

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:26.160
you're most proud of something you've achieved maybe through your use of technology

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.500
that's helped you achieve that thing?

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:34.660
Could be related to school or it could be games games

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:48.240
and remote control controls so you're quite the expert when it comes to games and

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:54.520
working with control. Yes I need help trying out accessible instruments

00:12:55.460 --> 00:13:01.460
I need help accessing music tech and recording studios. What we're doing through us really

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:07.480
isn't it I guess remotely in the house. When I started making music with Forget Me Not

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:14.840
productions it changed my life music transformed me I feel like I'm finally using my brain properly

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:14.880
and I'm using my brain to make music.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:22.620
Join me next time when I interview Yvonne Kanicki. Yvonne is a programmer and curator

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.500
specializing in black independent film.
