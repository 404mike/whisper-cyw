00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
Community house was run by the Christian Church to start with.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.260
It isn't any longer, but it was.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.300
And so the boys in the Asian Youth Club were coming into a Christian environment.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.080
Now, was this a problem?

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.100
Was it seen as a problem by the boys or by you?

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.100
Um, I think, I mean, I'm not looking to be boastful here,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.500
but I think Eaton Road and Community House at the time were quite lucky

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.860
that they were working with people who had a legitimacy in the community.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.740
They were people who were respected in their communities.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.180
People like Moniz Maflahi, myself, we had a lot to do with the local mosque in Harrow Road.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.460
Moniz had a lot to do with the mosque in Alexander Road in Pell.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.120
We had a young lad from Lound William Street, one of the local Pakistani lads,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.940
who was very well respected, a very good footballer, and a Bangladeshi lad.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.240
We had a range of people from different areas, different skills, different knowledge,

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.520
and who could relate to the young people.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.820
So we almost acted as a bridge between Community House

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.240
and Inverted Commerce, the church in the background,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.480
and the wider Muslim community in the area.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.400
I think we looked at the building and we saw,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.980
we realised there was a church element to the building,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:37.500
but we always saw the community part of the building as the greater part of the building.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.020
Now, I don't know why we did that.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.140
There was nobody ever said to us,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.700
well, this is a community centre more than it's a church.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.160
But for some reason, we just kind of imagined it so,

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.560
and we were happy to go along with that.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.140
But I think more important than the building and the church

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.920
was the people who were coming to the building, the young people,

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.180
we as workers, people like Brian, other people who were involved with the building,

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.480
and it was the people who kind of acted as the bridge and

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.320
made contact with other people and spoke to other people.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.820
So I think the role of the building was secondary.
