WEBVTT

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:14.820
Yes, we're ready to go now. Today is Friday the 23rd of September. My name is Jill Willie

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.700
and I'm at Habit Hardware talking to Mr John Jones, who has lived in this area all his

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.820
life. John, thank you very much for agreeing to have a chat with me. First of all, could

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.880
you just start with your year of birth, John, please? I was born on the 2nd of February,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.540
1948. And can you tell me where you were born? I was born in a bedroom at Upper Llandfadog.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.820
Llandfadog. Can you tell me exactly where Upper Llandfadog or Llandfadog, Llandfadog

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.900
is then, John? Well, as you go from Raider up the Ellen Valley, you go past the Ellen

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:03.980
Valley Hotel and it's the next farm on your right about 300 yards away. Thank you. And

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.000
what sort of facilities do you remember as you were growing up? Things like running water

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.300
and etc. Can you give me some details of that sort of thing? Well, we had no electricity.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:27.260
The toilet was outside about 50 yards away and the water we had from the spout and my mother

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:37.980
did all the washing and that out there and by the brook and bathing was a tin bath brought into the

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:48.780
kitchen, perhaps twice a week, sometimes only once a week. And no electricity so we had these

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.260
paraffin lamps that you had to pump up all the time when the pressure dropped.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:04.480
I see. And how much work did you yourself do around the farm, John, as a young boy growing up?

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:14.680
Um, I did quite a bit. When I attended Ellen Village School, I used to milk a cow every morning

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.140
by hand because we sold milk around the Elan Village and that was my contribution. I milked

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:29.820
this one cow who was my favourite, perched on a little stool and then I walked to the school

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:39.140
afterwards. And you actually got your water from where exactly, John? Well, between the house and

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.460
building at Llanfadog, there was a brook coming down and we had a spout and a little pool there

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:54.420
and that is where the water came from. But when I was about 10, we had it piped about 500 yards

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.460
from another well out in the field and that was wonderful spring water and the only time

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:12.660
I saw that goat rye was in the hot summer of 1976. Indeed. And were your family born at

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:20.580
and grew up in Llanfadog, Upper? My father was born there and my mother was born at the

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:32.580
Llanfadog. Now, we were a large family, John, in Llanfadog? Yes, we were. I was the fourth,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:40.180
but there was a baby loss between me and the sister above me. So we were five really.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:53.360
And so there was five of us, but I was born a long time after. My two older sisters was 22 and 20

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:01.520
when I was born and two of my three sisters were married with children. So I have nephews and nieces

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.200
older than myself. That's quite unusual, but of course it does happen.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.580
What sort of major events can you remember in the Allen Valley as you were growing up, John?

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:24.440
Well, I suppose the first one was when the Queen came with the ducal hellenbrough in October 1952.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:32.920
I would have been four-year-old and I just remember standing outside the hotel over on where the

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:40.740
bicycle path is now with our flags and my sister Joan was a waitress in the Allen Valley and she

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:51.300
waited on the Queen. Oh, what an accolade, my word. And what places did you have to play in and to

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.500
generally just explore in your Allen Valley area? On the farm, you had plenty of places,

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.440
you had fields all around you, but I think me and my nephews enjoyed going down the brook to where

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:11.680
it meets the River Allen and we were catching minnows there until I was old enough to have a

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:18.260
rod and line and I loved fishing in those days. Quite a lot of that goes on at the Allen Valley,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:25.800
doesn't it? Right, now what memories do you have of the big shearings that took place in the Allen

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:34.880
Valley, John? Oh, well, it was the highlight of the year. You swap men with neighbouring farms,

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:43.860
so you know there might be 30 men would come to your shearing and it was the day of the year.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:51.040
And you started off with breakfast and then you had lunch and tea and hopefully you finished

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:59.700
about five o'clock. And we had one hill which was up above the Clarewyn Dam, so them sheep had to be

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:06.560
driven down on a two-day drive sort of thing to share at Uppel and Vadog and then that night they

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:13.220
were taken back up to the hen run and they went on from there back to the hill next day.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:21.780
And shearing was a wonderful thing. As a boy, the highlight was after dinner we'd have a game of

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:29.880
football with all the younger men. But what I remember, there were four or five old men

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:36.100
sat outside the barn on a bench all day and all they were sitting down and talking

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:44.240
about tales and they seemed very old to me. But when I think back, they were probably only in their

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.940
late 60s, you know, but the way they dressed and that I thought they were a hundred.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:58.320
But I'm sure they had lots of interesting memories to share, yes. So would you say that despite the

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.920
rural locality you had plenty to do and a very good social life, you knew everyone?

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:12.800
Oh yes, I knew everyone and as I'd got two nephews living behind the Ellen Valley Hotel,

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.880
the three of us sort of played together most nights and played football in the field at

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:27.340
Llanwadog and later on when the Birmingham City police cadets came to Ellen Village,

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.880
they had goal posts put up on the green, so we used to go up there to play football

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:39.520
and I've seen us cycle down to Llanowethal to play Boys of Llanowethal and

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:50.020
well everywhere we went we cycled and I was a founder member of Raider Young Farmers and that

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:59.080
started in 1963 and still we were old enough to drive, we went there on a push bike which was

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:06.220
up in Bryn Tyrian and they held the meetings. And Bryn Tyrian I understand is the

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:12.420
then secondary school of the area, is that correct? Yes it was. The only time I ever

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:23.800
attended Bryn Tyrian was to try my 11 plus. Right, we'll come on to that now then, on to school life.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.880
Can you tell me where you went to school and what age you were when you started John?

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:37.660
I went to Ellen Village Primary School at Easter 1953.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:48.380
My birthday was February so I'd just gone five and my sister Joan took me to school the first morning

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:56.300
and all the other pupils were stood in the entrance I think waiting the newcomer and

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:05.520
I was there till 1959 and I had many a happy time looking back in the Valley School.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:13.000
We were never more than 20 pupils and I think when I left they were down to 12

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:20.980
and there was two teachers there. The first teacher was Mrs. Jim Price or Mrs. Betty Price

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.720
and the senior teacher was Miss Chu.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:40.300
I have heard those names. Could I add one more thing? Please. The only thing I hated about the

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:46.940
Lord Mayor of Birmingham came down and we had the June tea and of course the tea was nice.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:53.760
I loved that but afterwards we had to perform on stage and every year they seemed to have me to

00:09:53.760 --> 00:10:01.120
sing a solo and after that the Lady Mayoress presented us all with a book for what we'd done

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.580
during the year. If you'd done well you had the best books.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:15.600
Right and am I right in thinking that the school at the Ellen Village was where the lodge is now?

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:26.080
Yes it was. There was a school immediately above it when the works were going on but this new

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:35.480
school was built in 1909 and my mother went to the old school just above it but my father

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:43.940
was not allowed to go to that school because he was living in the Radnyshire side and he had to

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:52.280
walk three miles to come tie the school every day. So you yourself went to the Ellen Village

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:59.280
school but you were still in what was then Radnyshire weren't you? So were there many other

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:07.400
children from Radnyshire in that school? No I think at the time I left there was just two of us.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:15.360
The other boy didn't try the 11 plus so he went straight to Brinturion. There was three the same

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:23.040
age as me living on the Breckinshire side so they went to Bilth High School and they didn't have to

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:30.460
11 plus. I was the only one out of the five of us that had to try the 11 plus. And was that

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:36.680
because Radnyshire and Breckinshire being different authorities had decided different rules regarding

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:44.260
the 11 plus? Yes it has. I mean it's different now you can go to any school but in them days

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:51.440
it was Radnyshire and Breckinshire and I only lived 200 yards from the river Ellen and if I'd

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:58.220
been the other side I'd have been in Breckinshire. And would not have had to take the 11 plus I see.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:04.820
Now having taken the 11 plus what school did you then go to John? I went to Landerinder Grammar

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:14.280
School in the first week of September 1959 when a school car driven by Mr. Harold Ashton from the

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:24.240
opposite Jimmy Lloyd's yard drove me down to the bus and then we met the bus up by the Smithfield

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:32.400
in Radar and there was a boys bus and a girls bus. And how long were you at that school traveling

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:43.680
to and from then John? Well I left in 1963 because I'd had a couple of run-ins with Mr. Howell's

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:50.240
headmaster and he said that I had to try my own levels and I said I'll show you and I left.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:13:03.340
If you left right. John you must have seen quite a lot of changes in the valley. Would you like to

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:09.760
talk a little bit about the development of the valley as you know it? Well I've seen lots of

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:18.320
changes not for the better in my opinion. I you know although I'm a proud Welshman,

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:25.160
Birmingham were very good landlords and they were good to the farmers and they would provide new

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:32.000
gates and hurdles and fencing material every year and then when it changed over to Welsh water

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:43.320
it was a downward spiral and I think the valley was much better in those days, much tidier.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:49.880
You could fish from the Cabin Dam to Garry Dee. That railway line had two or three sheep in it and

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:57.680
it kept all the foliage down. Now it's just like a jungle and you can't fish one yard of it.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:05.420
Very very unfortunate because fishing is really quite a prominent activity in our area isn't it?

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:12.900
Yes. Speaking about the livestock now, how often did you actually come into Raerdy to the market

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:20.120
or to any other market? Well I don't remember coming much. My father you know would bring

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:28.520
a cow or cow and calf or something occasionally to the mart and we'd always sell our sail ews

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:37.940
in the autumn and we drove them down with two dogs and I sometimes walked in front and my father

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:45.560
behind and we never lost one. We always got them to the market and tied the dogs up there all day

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:56.280
and sold and one year the prices were poor so we didn't sell. I was about 16 at the time.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:04.400
Anyway my father was getting on then and a car stopped when we were driving these sheep home

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:12.300
and he offered father a lift home and he said I'll leave my dog with you and soon as father got in

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:20.620
a car the dog went back towards Raerdy and unfortunately he got killed by a car and I

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:29.100
got the sheep home with my dog and then my sister Joan went back to Raerdy in the van to look for

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:35.800
this dog and found him dead on the road and brought him back. That was a sad day. How unfortunate.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:44.060
And we took the sheep to the next fair and didn't do any better so we may as well have sold them on

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:51.480
the first fair. All memories of course Joan aren't they? Yes. Now if we could come back to

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:57.020
the school I believe you had some relatives that actually taught at that school

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:02.600
John. Can you tell us a little bit about that please? Well they didn't teach at that school.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:09.880
They taught at the old school up the cabin which is now under the water. I think they moved here

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:22.080
in 1891. Elizabeth Abley and her sister Alice Ann Abley who became my grandmother. She married

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:30.400
Evan Jones from Upland Paddock and they were brought here to teach English because they knew

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:37.140
that the dams was coming and there was a lot of English and Irish and Scotch people moving into

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:42.920
the area so that was the end of the Welsh language in the Allen Valley school.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:53.800
The demise of the Welsh language in the valley is something I'd like to touch on now. Prior to that

00:16:53.800 --> 00:17:00.480
your family would have been Welsh speakers presumably, your ancestors. Yes. Do you actually

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:07.260
remember any of your family older relatives actually speaking Welsh as their day-to-day

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:15.380
language? Well my father could speak Welsh quite good but as he had an English mother there was

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:24.660
English spoke at home you know but his father was fluent Welsh and then on my mother's side the family

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:35.660
they were all fluent Welsh but you know they had died before I was sort of born so and my

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:45.360
grandfather and grandmother from the clean they were more English than Welsh because they were

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:52.560
both well one was brought up but the Gunfad and the other was born brought up at the Dunfad

00:17:52.560 --> 00:18:01.700
Newbridge on Wye. I see and so was Welsh not taught at all then in either of those schools

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:08.240
the the old one you've mentioned and the current one was Welsh not taught at all? No there was no

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:13.540
Welsh in school when I was there well we did the national anthem and that in Welsh but

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:20.930
no it was all English. I see and what about your grammar school days then in in Llandrindod

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:27.710
was did you did you learn Welsh there at all? Yes when I went to Llandrindod I had the choice

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:36.750
to either learn Welsh or French and I was taught Welsh with a teacher called Annie Griffiths.

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:49.810
Right so sadly well there's a real resurgence now in learning Welsh of course but it's you know

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:56.190
it's a little sad. Yeah my two grandchildren now Arthur and Marnie are both in the Welsh unit.

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:04.570
That's a very good idea that's here in Raerdyr isn't it? Yes in yes in Brinterion which I'm very

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:14.470
pleased about because I am very Welsh you know in my thoughts. Very commendable John I'm sure.

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:21.030
John could we touch on pony trekking I understand you had quite an involvement in that in your

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:29.310
younger days. Yes I was on the pony trekking committee for many years they were called Raerdyr

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:37.790
Association and Mr David Evans was the secretary and people like Kinsey Morgan and

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:45.430
Gerald Morgan were chairman and vice chairman and I was always interested in it probably because

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:56.390
every year a lot of pretty girls came along and I met one called Gina Day and after on and off

00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:04.230
romance for four years I married her and she is now still called Gina Jones but unfortunately

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:12.550
we got divorced but the trekking was a wonderful thing and I've seen up to a hundred ponies going

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:21.850
out on a day you know terrific line of trekkers and they came from all over the well all over

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:31.770
Europe actually but in the end I was guide for two years and it was a much harder job then because

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:40.050
instead of having a trekker for a week who would pick up things you had day trekkers and half of

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:45.770
them couldn't ride and you couldn't go any faster than the slowest rider or the poorest rider and

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:53.910
some of you had to lead you know but I always found out that if anybody arrived on a motorbike

00:20:53.910 --> 00:21:00.250
they could ride and was the balance was right I've never seen a poor rider off a motorbike

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:08.770
using the same muscles I wouldn't I wouldn't doubt fine now John you've spoken about

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:17.030
riding your bike a lot for recreation etc did you use horses as a means of transport

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:24.390
for getting around generally at all oh yes my father was always on horseback he used to do all

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:32.090
the gathering of sheep on horseback and I rode a horse a lot like I was probably riding a three

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:39.850
year old I think I started off on the donkey in Aberystwyth but I've got a photo of me on that and

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:50.410
we had a hill up above the clowind dam called Clodhia so when we wanted to gather that

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:57.750
we would ride up to the hen front and then go over the top of the hill and drop down on Clodhia

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:04.270
always on horseback drive the sheep back down what we wanted to bring down to the hen front

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:11.510
have dinner there with my auntie and uncle and then drive them down to Llanfadog on horseback

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:20.490
but mind you in those days and talking up to 1979 the roads were much quieter than today

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:27.090
and you felt quite happy now you can't go 100 yards without there's a car behind you

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:34.710
things have certainly changed haven't they in the transport department yes and John I understand

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:40.850
you work very hard and long on compiling your family tree and am I right in thinking that

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:48.450
it takes you right back to the Lewis Lloyds the original landowners yes well me and my son Tom

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:55.230
have done a lot of work on it and I've had help of other people but being as they were sort of

00:22:55.230 --> 00:23:02.670
indigentry it was quite easy to trace them but Tom has gone back I think it's 700 years

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:10.250
to the Powells from Lanarkow who married into the Lewis Lloyds and I've got it down to this present

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:19.070
day which I'm very proud of and now when the dams are very low the walls of Nantwilt have all come

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:26.890
sight of the gardens you know and that's what I think you know that it all started for me in

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:33.690
the Allen Valley well it's wonderful to see these houses suddenly arising out of the water isn't it

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:42.270
it makes you want to do that you mentioned the Llanarkow that was and Nantwilt I believe where

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:48.170
the where the Lewis Lloyds lived were they actually in the Allen Valley or were they in the Clydewyn

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:59.290
Valley well it's actually on the banks of the Clirwyn River isn't it the Nantwilt estate but

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:06.150
I mean they own so much of it right up to Clirwyn Farm which you know is miles above the Clirwyn Dam

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:16.230
and one of my ancestors Peter Jones from Abergwessin who already was a huge landowner

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:24.770
over there and had thousands of sheep he married into the Lewis Lloyds and the rest is history as

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:30.310
they say and how long have you been working on this family tree then you and your son oh

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:40.470
you're never finished you know there's something comes up new all the time I found a cousin in

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:51.130
the other day Sanders her name is Miss Sanders and there's a lot of them out in Perth and Patagonia

00:24:51.770 --> 00:25:02.830
and um mother's great uncle David Jones had a farm out in Buenos Aires and the name of the farm

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:11.130
was Alvira and my mother named my older sister Alvira Mary how nice

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:17.910
right you have grandchildren now now John um are they enjoying being at the valley and enjoying

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:24.670
the places where you grew up yes because I've still got some ground of belonging to Apple and

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:31.650
Raddick and they love it up there Arthur went up the other day to burn a bit of cardboard and

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:38.730
and he thinks it's wonderful and Marnie's up there every night with her father running a dog around

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:43.010
and they I think it's nice to get out of town

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:50.850
what better place indeed than the the beautiful land the beautiful Ellen Valley

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:57.350
well John it's been absolutely fascinating talking to you we could go on all day really

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:02.030
thinking about things so thank you very very much for your input your time

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:09.630
and all your fascinating information thank you very much for you asking me these questions

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:11.210
you're welcome
