00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
just above Manseth, and there were huge coal tips.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.640
So there's a wonderful area to play in, you know,

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.040
and we'd play all sorts of cowboys,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.240
Indians hide and seek and all that,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.520
you know, sort of areas,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.400
but we'd also have a tin sheet

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.440
and slide down these tips, you know.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.020
It was another thing I really remember now.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.060
Yeah, certainly the cinema had some effect on us,

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.480
but I mean, we didn't think we could be supermams.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.800
But certainly cows in India

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.240
was a big part of being a junior school child anyway.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.980
I would be in the 50s, obviously, yeah.
