00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
I attended a Scwla Dderwen primary school which was the Welsh medium primary school

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.440
in Cymraeddyn.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.800
It was the only, and still is the only, Welsh medium school in the town.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.300
It hadn't struck me until I reached secondary school how large the school was.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.380
It had 300 or so children, so it was quite a large school.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.740
But at the time you hadn't realised its size.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.960
Within the classroom we had a blackboard.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:45.220
Certain classrooms had a revolving blackboard which was posh in comparison with one blackboard

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.660
on the wall.
