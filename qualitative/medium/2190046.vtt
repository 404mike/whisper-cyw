00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.820
I'm Vicki MacDonald and I'm at Holy Trinity Church, Llandudno, during the longest yarn.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.760
And I'm speaking to Wendy Lonsdale, who has memories of her parents during the war.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.860
Wendy, what do you want to tell me?

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.380
Well, I was born in 1941, so I was always called a war baby.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.960
My mother used to, we lived actually in Port-au-Guest,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.520
and we had an antique business in Port-Madoc.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:42.440
So when the phony war came, my mother panicked and thought that the Germans were going to land on Black Rock sands.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.280
And so she started taking all her valuable antiques down into the cellar,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.940
until I think my father told her not to be so silly.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.060
So that was the first story that I can recall.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.340
And I do remember that my father was in the Home Guard in the first few years of the war,

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:14.700
and he was stationed up below Snowdon, near Capelkirrig, guarding the pipeline,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.660
which was water, I gather, it was a water.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.780
But I didn't hear very much about that.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.340
And then at the beginning of the war, anybody who had a house with a spare bedroom

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:42.780
was told they had to take members of the services, or they had to have somebody to live with them.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.380
So my mother decided, or evacuated, so my mother said,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:55.040
oh, well, we've got premises above the shop, we'll go down to the shop and live over the shop in Port-Madoc,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.480
and we'll let a family come and live in our house in Port-au-Guest.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.220
And I'm not quite sure how long we were there, but I was born over the shop.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.060
And I remember my mother saying to her mother,

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.920
well, I don't remember it, but she told me this,

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.240
that, oh, I can't possibly have a baby over the shop.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.440
And my grandmother apparently said, you'd be surprised where you can have a baby.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.560
So during the war, obviously, I was a baby, and my mother took me on the,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.160
I think we must have had a, we went by taxi, I think, to Liverpool,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.920
because that's where her mother and father lived in Liverpool,

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.760
but not in Liverpool itself, out in Great Crosby.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.260
And my grandmother apparently used to say, they'd telephone and say, do you think it's safe to come?

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.700
And my grandmother said, well, there haven't been any bombs recently.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.360
I think you're safe to come.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.560
So then apparently we were, I was taken as a baby in arms up to Liverpool,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.020
and as soon as we got there, the bombs started dropping.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.360
And at nearly the end of the war, my father had then been called up because he was older.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.060
He was called up and he was in the Royal Corps of Signals,

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.740
and doing, learning how to do codes and things like that.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.180
And he was, I remember he was in Scarborough.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.800
And for some reason, we went to stay in Scarborough.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.020
We went on the train.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.440
And I can remember going on the train and all the soldiers on the train,

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.420
sort of making a big fuss of me because I was a little girl.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.640
And we got to Scarborough and stayed there a few days, I suppose.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.540
Those are my earliest memories.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.080
And you told me one memory about your mother and the knives.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.220
Yes. So because it was an antique shop, she had a lot of, well, knives,

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.080
very obviously, very dangerous knives from the Far East.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.080
And there were Dutch commandos stationed, I think near Harlech.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:16.580
And they came into the shop and wanted to know if she had any sharp knives,

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.380
because we'll get the so-and-so's.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.980
They were going out to the Far East. They were stationed.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.240
Did she sell them, the knives?

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.840
Oh, yes.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.520
Yes, she sold whatever she had.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.240
She was glad to get rid of them, I think.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.940
So your mother had quite a busy wartime.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.480
There were other memories?

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.060
Yes. Well, so then talking about the being,

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.660
because I was born over the shop, as it were, the house was...

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.460
Sorry, I stopped the tape for a moment. Wendy's going to continue.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:03.240
Just to say that a family came from London and lived in our house during the war.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.900


00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.220
Well, I suppose you'd call them evacuees, but yes, it was a family.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.800
It was instead of having soldiers, I suppose,

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.000
because otherwise we'd have had soldiers living in it.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.320
And it was a very nice bungalow in Borthogest.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.100
So thank you, Wendy.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.920
Thank you for your wonderful memories of the war and your mother's war as well.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.660
So did she survive it all and the antique shop stayed open after the war?

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.140
Indeed, yes, until 1950s.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.400
Oh, that was lovely. Thank you so much. Thank you for doing that.
