00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.440
One interview with Mrs. Eris Williams of Edmonton.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.100
You were asking about the Welsh language.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.800
Now, this is very interesting, Glenys, because it goes back to the very beginning of what

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.640
I said about the Welsh church here.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:31.200
This has been a very integral part of the keeping of the Welsh culture of the language,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.340
particularly possibly for my sister's generation and mine.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:45.540
It was completely Welsh service, of course, and they carried out the format of the service

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.360
as much as they do in the Welsh chapels in Wales.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:59.360
And we simply had to go in front during the service, as many of the children did, to recite

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:06.400
Welsh verses or verses of hymns, biblical verses I was referring to first of all.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.960
And that, I think, is where we got our real grounding of the pronunciation and, well,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.780
the understanding of it.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.340
And all my parents were as Welsh as anyone who ever came out of Wales.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:28.600
My father was Mr. T. Morris Hughes from Molde in Flintshire, and our mother was from Rhytham.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.580
And they spoke every word of Welsh in the house, but somehow didn't carry on the conversation

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.500
with Stella and myself.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.860
And we often mentioned it to them in later years.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.800
Mama used to say, well, you had your grounding in the Welsh verses and the way you memorised.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.800
And it's really rather difficult to understand why they didn't keep it up.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.180
We understand practically every word.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:06.640
And then, of course, I was very fortunate to marry Len, who is from Anglesey, from Llanfodrog,

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.860
from Anglesey, and to this day I tease him that he thinks in Welsh and speaks in English.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.740
And though we don't converse, he has never lost his Welsh.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.120
As a matter of fact, 16 years ago we went back to Wales and he spoke as fluent Welsh

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.820
as he did.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.260
At that time he'd been out here 35 years and simply thrilled everybody.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.980
So of course he kept my Welsh up.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.400
I used to do a little bit of singing and of course he did too.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:53.000
And our son, Glyn, learned his Welsh hymn, which he sang as guest soloist in San Francisco

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.100
National Commando there, through coaching by his father, Glyn, of course.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.400
So we have been very fortunate in being able to keep the process to a certain extent, the

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.340
understanding, but I'm not very fluent in the actual conversational Welsh.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.320
Would you like to say just a few words in Welsh to finish?

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.140
Well I rather stun my listeners occasionally.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:34.620
As a matter of fact, not too long ago I was describing Anglesey and mentioning about the

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.160
littlest town there with the largest name in Llanfair, Pwll Gwengill, Gogherwch, Hwyrindrobwll,

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.880
Llandysillogogoch.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:51.980
And I often played the record of the pro-male voice choir.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:01.160
And I'm always tempted, which I practically always do, tell them that it's all right to

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:09.360
say they're from Hros, but for those who know better, they come from Hros, Llanysillogogoch.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.080
And believe it or not, I found that really more of a problem than Llanfair P.G.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.880
But, oh, I don't know, I think possibly I'll carry on this program.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.960
It is unique.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:30.200
As far as I know, I don't think there is another Welsh program in North America.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.380
I've never heard of any in the States.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.700
And I'm quite sure there isn't another one in Canada.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.500
If there is, I would most certainly like to hear of it.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.240
But CKUA is rather a unique station.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:58.580
It is non-commercial and just is centered around ethnic groups and has been a great

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.480
help to the Welsh community of Edmonton.
