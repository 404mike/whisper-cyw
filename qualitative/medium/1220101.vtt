00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
And I think in Kuwait, I've got all good memories really, you know, I was very lucky, I had a really happy childhood.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:13.320
I had a good parent and other than that I had a good sort of teenage years.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:22.640
We used to go out a lot with friends and parties and cinema and all the things young people did in those days.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.300
Were your friends mainly Jewish or Miss Jew?

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.960
Mostly because of the clubs, you know, I went to clubs and that's where I met.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.440
But I had my school friends as well who would always come to a party, you know.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.660
I don't remember, everything social seemed to be amongst the Jewish community, I have to say, and Jewish friends.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.020
We'd have parties and everybody.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.260
We had a field, we had a big garden, the bottom of the garden, it's all built over now.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.940
It's, we called it the Wimpy Estate, it's all built up all behind there.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:08.720
We had a field and in the field we had chickens and a couple of goats and a couple of geese that used to frighten the life out of us because they were very friendly.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:17.100
And a horse, which was, my sister was the horse rider, she had a pony, I should really say, and she absolutely loved her.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:25.180
Even though there's only 18 months between us, when you're a child, a sister 18 months older than you doesn't, you know, doesn't want to know you really.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:34.880
So she was the one and her friends, a lot of her friends had horses or ponies and she used to take it to like pony club events.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.540
But frightened the life out of me, I wasn't a horse rider.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.680
I may have been daring in some things but horse riding wasn't for me.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.480
You were jealous?

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.440
I wasn't jealous, no.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.260
My father did a silly thing to me, it was his fault I didn't like.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.940
It's a silly story, I don't know if you want silly stories.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:05.580
But he made me get on the horse and I got on and then he threw a stick at the horse so the horse would run off with me sitting on it.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.620
And that was it, finished.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.540
I wasn't, I wouldn't go on the horse again.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.580
So it was his weird sense of humour I reckon.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.760
Perhaps he didn't want to buy another horse.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.860
He didn't want to buy another horse.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.560
I don't know what made him do that.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.040
He must have thought it was funny.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.800
So you had two sisters and a brother?

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.440
Yes.
