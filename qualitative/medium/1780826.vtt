WEBVTT

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.560
And I'm just going to say at the top of the tape that I'm Marcia Marnie and I'm with Margaret

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.980
Prosser and I can't see the name of your farm.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.120
What's the name of the farm?

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.120
Croynant.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.180
C-R-Y-N-A-N-G.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.960
Croynant Farm and it's Rudry.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:14.720
Rudry?

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.480


00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.140
Near Cuffilly.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.960
Near Cuffilly.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.280
I thought we were near Cuffilly.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:18.840


00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.660
And it is Friday, September the 6th, 2019.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.300
So I'm just going to pop that down there.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.120
When we were coming over the hill I could see, I thought, are we near Cuffilly?

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.960
I couldn't believe it.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.180
I didn't think we were that close.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.800
You came up this road here.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.420


00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.560
So you're looking across there.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.520
It's a different perspective because it's gorgeous looking across the levels there,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.920
isn't it?

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.880
Yes, yes it is.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.240
Yes, yes, yes.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.240
And then when you get on the top there you can see Clevedon Pier.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.560


00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.360
Really?

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.640
That's amazing.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.700
I might have to come back when it's a clearer day.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.680
Yes, that's right.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.120
Yes, it's not so clear today.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.120
I suppose if we'd had a rain this morning it makes it more limited, more on show.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.920
You've met Marjorie Neale, have you?

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.200
Yes, I've met Marjorie.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.860
Yes, yes.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.100
Are you related to her?

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.480
No, no, we're great friends.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.200
Oh really?

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.240
I'm from a young farmer's days.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.480
Oh crikey.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.780
Yes, yes, yes.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.420
Oh, yeah, everyone's, it's so lovely.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.060
Everyone, I have to say Margaret, everyone I've met have been just adorable and so open

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.760
and welcoming.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.380
It's just so lovely.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.600


00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.300
It's making my job so much easier.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.620
Because Marjorie was born there on the moors, she was born there.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.300
Would you know Steph Davis?

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.740
Oh, what's her maiden name?

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.060
I can't think of her maiden name now.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.880
She was born at Lower Newton House, I think.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.220
Stephanie.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.080
Stephanie.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.980
I can't think of her name now.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.240
I'll think of it.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.640
But I wonder if we can just start off, if you could just tell us when you were born

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.840
and where you were born.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.640
I was born at 31 Herbert Avenue, Riska.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.400
As I say, my mother was a farmer's daughter and my father worked in the steelworks.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.100
We moved from there then to Park Place at Riska.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.640
We lived there for quite a few years.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.740
And then we moved from there then and took the farm at Langorse.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:31.360
And that was 1946, 47, that's right.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.640
And then I moved back down then to Sluson in 1956 when I married Dewan.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.040
So what was your father's name?

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.880
William Benjamin Thomas.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.100
And your mother?

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.120
Minnie Harris.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.720
Oh, that's a nice name, Minnie.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.660
So your father worked in the steelworks, he says.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.140
Yes, yes.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.780


00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.240
In Pontymester Steelworks, which is not there at the moment.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.540
That was taken down some years ago.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:56.860
Was that in Newport?

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.680
Riska.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.600
Ah.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.500
Pontymester Riska.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.160
Yeah.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.080
So he wasn't a farmer at all?

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.560
No, no, no.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.000
And then he had his sister, Evelyn Mary Thomas, and she was 44 years in Riska at a radio

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.340
and a natural gas shop.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:21.860
And then his other sister, Auntie Phyllis, Phyllis Thomas, she was a teacher up in Abercarne.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.320
And they lived in, I've got to think of the name of the place now.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.360
Oh dear, that's terrible.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.060
They lived in Woodland Drive in Rogerstone.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.280
I don't know whether you know that area, do you?

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.540
No, I don't.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.540
Do you know Riska at all?

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.940
Not very well at all, no.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.440
No, you go up through Woodland Drive, Rogerstone up to Riska, and then of course you carry

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.380
on up the valley then.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.220
So your mother was from a farming background?

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.940
Yes, yes.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:49.800
Where was she from?

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.940
Newhouse Farm, Pontaig, near Pontipour.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:53.120
Okay.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.380
Well Newin it was really.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.380
So how did she meet your father?

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:04.980
Well I think my grandparents on my mother's side, father's side, lived in Newin.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.220
And I think that's where dad used to go back and forth, you know, to see them and that's

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.300
where they met I suppose.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.100
It's funny how people do meet, don't they?

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.180
So your father had to learn how to be a farmer then, seemingly.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.320
Yes, he was always interested.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:23.120
His cousin used to keep the Mardie Farm, Courcourneau, just below the Courcourneau Golf Course.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.720
Yes.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.040
And he spent a lot of time there.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.080
So that, you know, he really got fed up with the, as the saying is, the stearworks.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.900
So he thought they'd branch out and they had this farming land course then.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.820
And we took that over Lockstock and Barry.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.220
We took over the, when they say Lockstock and Barry, we took over the stock and rented

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.060
the farm there.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.380


00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.500


00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.920
Land course and I liked land course very much.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.000
We'd look out for the door and you could see the plenivan.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.900
Oh yes.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.300
Yes.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.260
And 1947 was a winter.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.220
Oh terrible.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.960
Was it really?

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.020
Oh shocking yes.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.740
I mean we had tremendous snow.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.120
The milk didn't go from there to the, with the lorry for over a week.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.620
Wow.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.940
Because we were snowed up.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:06.280
Yeah.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.460
We went out to the hedges.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.900
Crikey.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:17.700
And then there was a camp of Italians at Bulk and there was another, the Germans in, Italian,

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.980
German soldiers in Brecon and they kept through really.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.020


00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.540
Amazing.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.020
Yes it was, it was horrendous.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.320
So and then I used to go to school in Brecon then from land course.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.000
Walk up to the hill.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.040
I used to hate school.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.280
I'd rather be home doing the work there.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.460
And I used to, I was sightless sometimes but I'd walk at the times and I used to really

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.320
doodle you know.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.520
And then I'd hear the train coming around from Talga to Brecon and stop at the Land

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.380
Course Halt and I'd try to, but no I never got there and I came home and then my father

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.380
said look you cannot do this you see.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.280
You must, you've got to go to school.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.240
I said well I don't like school.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.900
So I left when I was fifteen.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.920
So that was my story of school in Brecon.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.580
Crikey.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.320
So how old were you when your family moved down here?

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.340
Or when I say here, over there?

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.080
Oh to Berry Hill.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.880
So where is Berry Hill?

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:20.140
It's on the main road, go through Castleton, it's Newport and before you get down to where

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:26.200
there's a big walk over a bridge, well it's on the right hand side before you get there.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.840
Yes.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.180
It's not there now.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.060
Is it gone?

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.800
No the farm is still there.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.340


00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.180
Well they were, pick your own.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.100
But they haven't done that for some time now.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.700
And there's a bungalow that's built next to it which the person that took over after

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.620
my mother and father finished, he was there for some time.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.060
Well I'll tell you who was there, it was Robert Peel.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.320
You know Robert Peel, this is his grandson but his name was Robert.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.020
Really?

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:54.460
Yes.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.160
Amazing.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.140
So why did your parents move from Langhorth?

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.320
Why did they come here?

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:06.960
Well because, well it was a bit bigger farm and we liked this area more because my parents,

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.420
well my father particularly moved from this area and as I say his cousin used to farm

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:17.340
the farm down below so there's quite a lot of, you know over there with them.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.440
And then, so did your parents move to Sleuth's Farm or was that you?

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.060
No I moved to Sleuth's Farm.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.880
I married from Berry Hill and married Dilwyn from Sleuth's Farm.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.620
So how did you meet Dilwyn?

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.660
Oh Young Farmers.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.020
It's quite a matter of how many places we did.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.020
Yes Young Farmers, that's who we belonged to.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.800
So was it very active then Young Farmers?

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.660
Yes we were, yes.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.020
St. Malan's Young Farmers it went under.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:50.000
But I did belong to the Llynsefad and Young Farmers in Bracken or Langhorth when I was

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.260
there.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:54.260
And yes we were quite active you know.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.560
Yes we slept and fenced, we'd go to different shows and so forth you know.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.020
But oh yes it's quite a matter of how many places Young Farmers had.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:04.160
Really?

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.020
Yes.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:10.460
I've heard that so many times people who've met through, it must be an informal marriage

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:10.980
bureau.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:11.620
Yes.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.020
Crikey.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.640
Oh yes, yes.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.480
So you met Dilwyn and then he was already living at?

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.920
He was born down in Sleuth's.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.600
He was born there.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.200
Yes, yes and he's got two sisters.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:30.120
One is Betty which is two years younger, older and she's living in Gloucester.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.380
She's 19 now.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:36.240
And then the other sister lived at, did you see who met Derek?

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:36.740
Yes.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.400
Well Derek's mother was his sister to Dilwyn.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.180
Oh okay.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:40.760
Doreen.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.300
Yes.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:46.900
She died, oh she wasn't very old, she was quite good cancer bad and very sad it was.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:47.640
Yes.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.220
And that's right Derek.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.200
So how have we met, how did you come to meet Derek, excuse me, ask it.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.980
Well Derek and Andrew were both through John Souther who worked for the drainage board.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:58.900
Ah right.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:08:59.460
Yes.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:04.840
Yes he's the chap that goes round cleaning them and talking to all the landowners and

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.060
stuff.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.640
So John introduced me to, he said you've got to speak to Derek and Andrew Prosser.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:10.360
Oh.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.860
So that and then that's why I'm here now.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:13.340
Yes.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:13.580
Yes.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.620
Very grateful to him.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:14.900
Yes.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.540
Well my father Prosser he was on the drainage board and he was supposed to lend at different

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.700
meetings and that you know.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.540
So that's Dilwyn's father.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:23.720


00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.120
So what was his full name?

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:25.700
Winford.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:26.940
Winford Prosser.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.240
So what.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.900
And his wife was living at Lansoy and I don't know how they met.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:43.620
Let me see, I think Dilwyn's father had a housekeeper and then my mother-in-law Marjorie,

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:50.800
she was Marjorie, she came down to meet her and then they seemed to get friendly and then

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.820
they married you see.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:52.460


00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.500
Yes Lansoy.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.700
Lansoy at the side desk.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.840
So what was, sorry what was his name Winford?

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.400
Winford.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.000
Winford.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.140
So he was on the drainage board.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:03.720
Yes.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.560
Yes and Dilwyn was on the drainage board.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:06.400


00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.440
So I'm getting confused.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.040
So Winford is Dilwyn's father.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:09.700
That's right.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.120
So Winford was on the drainage board.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.540
So what can you tell me about Dilwyn's parents on the farm?

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:25.920
Well, Dilwyn's dad Winford has got a brother, I'll show you photographs of them afterwards.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:31.680
Campbell Prosser, he was a barrister-in-law and he was out abroad for a long time in Singapore.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:32.500
Really?

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.460
And then he had a sister, which I've got the photograph, the whole family's up there,

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.440
you can see later on.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:51.680
And then he had a sister that lived in Cardiff Road and then is Missy Campbell and then there

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:58.720
was Dilwyn who was killed in the war, first world war and that was Winford.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.960
Well I'll have to, I can show you the photograph.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.820
It's on the wall so it's easy for you to have a look at it on the wall really.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.320
So that was, that was Dilwyn's father's side, you see.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.940
And they had butcher shops in Cardiff, Clifton Street.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:14.600
Yes.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.960
There was a big butchery in there.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.160
And that was their business more or less, you know.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.640
So a butchery shop.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.260
Yes.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:22.760
Butcher shop.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.820
So when did the farm come into the...

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:31.220
Well Winford, he wasn't keen on the butchery shop so he went farming then.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.860
So he took over, took sluice and rented sluice.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:35.520
Oh right.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.660
And then of course the milk.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.380
And then they used to have a milk round with a milk van and everything.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.160
And Dilwyn used to go occasionally when his father had a meeting up in London but he wasn't

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.780
so keen on the milk round.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:54.420
But he used to do it when his father had to go to London for meetings with the drainage

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.340
port and that, you know.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.620
So why did they have meetings in London?

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.400
I don't know really.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:05.820
And of course they used to have the meetings out at Magad, didn't they?

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:06.520
Yeah.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.400
That's the place.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.260
Is it Magad?

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.700
Yes, Magad, isn't it?

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.800
They used to have the...

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.520
Oh, Nash?

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.440
Nash rather.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.040
That's right.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:13.680
Pie Corner.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.760
That's right, Pie Corner.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:15.360
Yeah.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.060
Yes, Nash.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:17.120
Yes, yeah.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.840
So was it always a dairy farm then, the sluice farm?

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.520
Yes, yes.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.360
Yes, they had cows and everything and sheep.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:33.860
But, and then we moved up here later and then they moved there but then they went out to

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.080
the cows and so the Andros only got the sheep at the moment.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.000
So then you met Dilwyn?

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.280
Three young farmers.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.240
Three young farmers.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:46.360
And so where did you marry actually?

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.040
In Coorkeen O'Church.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:48.500
Oh, did you?

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.980
It's a dear little church, yes.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:50.200
Yeah.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.360
It's a house now that's been turned into...

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:52.580
Yes, Coorkeen.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:58.320
Do you know, do you know, well, you know the main one I said about this article is you

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.600
turn down for Coorkeen for the golf course?

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:00.980
Yes.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.260
And it's just before you get to the golf course.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.400
Or just after the golf course, sorry.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:05.980
On the right?

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.780
On the left-hand side you've got a little lane up to the church.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:09.900
Really?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.400
Hmm.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.200
Oh, I don't think I've been to the church.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:12.860
Oh, I don't think...

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:13.740
It's a house now.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:14.660
It's...

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:15.780
Was it a chapel then?

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:16.320
Or was it a chapel?

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.140
No, a church.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:17.880
Hmm.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:18.480
Really?

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.240
Yeah, Coorkeen O'Church.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.220
Oh, I have to go back that way afterwards.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.420
I might go and have a look.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.940
Yes, yes, yes.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:24.100


00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.400
And I think there's three or four houses there.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.000
Hmm.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.360
Because there was a farm next to it but they've gone into, into homesteads, you see.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.400
So then, so did you then start your married life at Soos Farm?

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.160
Yes.

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.480
You moved in with your in-laws?

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:39.840
Yes.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.680
No, no, they moved, they built a house.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.240
Do you see the house on the side there?

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:43.560
Yes.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.580
They built that.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:44.920
Oh.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:49.600
And then we went into the farmhouse and they built, built that and went into there.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.540
So this would have been what, the mid-fifties?

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:53.940
Yes, 57.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.020
57?

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:55.660
Yes.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.560
So, so what was the farm doing then?

00:13:58.740 --> 00:13:59.560
Was it...

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.020
Milk.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:00.520
Milk.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.700
Milk and milk round.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:02.260
Yeah.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.660
Yeah, and they'd fill the bottles, you know, and wash the bottles then in the little shed

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:07.200
that was there.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:07.820
Yeah.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.200
That's...

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.540
Yes, I think I've got a photograph here.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:12.860
Excuse me.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.660
How many cows did you have, Margaret?

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:17.020
Hmm?

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.420
How many cows did you have?

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.140
Well, not like they got today, they got hundreds today, haven't they?

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:22.540


00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.080
But they were only about 125.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:24.900
That's dope.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.420
Which was quite, you know, big for those days, I suppose, wasn't it, you know?

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.420
Yes, I've got a photograph here, I think, aren't there?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:32.000


00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.760
And that wasn't all hand-milked, was it?

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.380
Was that all milked by hand?

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.540
Well, it was years ago and then they went in with the machines then, you know.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.700
This is a photograph, this is Lewis House.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.360
This was before 1963.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.740
That's where it was when I used to live there, you see.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.280
Oh, crikey.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.960
There was a milk van right there.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:57.400
Yeah.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.500
A dairy there where they used to wash the bottles.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.000
Yeah.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:02.320
Cows used to go into there.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:02.760
Yeah.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.260
And then this was the garden, I mean, Anne's got a beautiful garden down there now.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:06.860


00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.120
And then there was just a shed where we kept chickens.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:09.760
Yes.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.980
So it all altered, of course, because all this is buildings here now.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.560
This is all changed, isn't it?

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.000
Yeah, all different.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.240
I mean, it's all built up.

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:17.820


00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:18.580
Very rural then.

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:19.480
Yes, yes, yes.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.060
It was.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:20.580
Crikey.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:26.700
And then in this field here, which was owned, that's where they built the house, you can

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:27.500
see Wyvern.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:28.360
Oh.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.780
You know, they built that there.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.540
Did they build that because Dilwyn was getting married?

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.120
Yes, yes, they built that to go in there.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:40.220
And, oh, it was only thinking the other day.

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.620
I think it was about 90.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.820
Oh, I've forgotten the money.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.920
I'm just thinking about how much it costs the other day.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:53.300
The bridge costs nearly more to get across the reed to get to the house than the house,

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:53.620
I think.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:54.300
Really?

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.080
Yes, it was.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.680
You forget about that, don't you?

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.280
Yes, you do.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.240
You have to get across the reed.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:58.700
That's true.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.040
Yes, yes.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:04.280
So what were your first impressions when you moved down there and started married life?

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:09.320
Well, I used to go back and forth there before we were actually married, you know, and have

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.880
supper and things with Mother-in-law and that.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:18.660
And, yes, well, I liked it very much because we had ground with Berry Hill.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.620
We had two fields on the moors, as we call them.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:22.420
Okay, yeah.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.340
And rented those.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.880
And so it wasn't any different for me really, you know.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.300
Yeah.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.420
And then, of course, we used to go to young farmers there.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.880
We used to go to young farmers club in St. Melan's.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.440
Did you?

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.340
Yes, yes.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.780
St. Chaple used to hold the young farmers meetings.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:38.120


00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.380
But, oh, yes.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.420
So I enjoyed life.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:42.820
A farmer's wife.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.300
So I've spoken to lots of farmers.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:53.040
And so as a farmer's wife, would you have been aware of and concerned with all the reams

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.640
and the maintenance and stuff?

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:59.400
I mean, I guess what I'm trying to ask is, was there very much a clear, this was what

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.000
the woman did and this is what the men did, or was it all mixed up?

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:09.720
Well, I think I used to enjoy going out and feeding calves and things and that, you know.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:14.380
And then when I was born, we used to put him in the plan, put him in the corner of the

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:18.480
milking shed and he'd be sat there, you know, watching the cows coming in and out and all

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:18.580
that.

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:24.840
And before we had a parlour that was the milking parlour type of thing, you know, where you

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.280
could get up and in and mushing.

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:30.880
But, yeah, I've always been interested outside.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:36.140
I used to spend quite a bit of time before we went to Langhorst with my grandparents

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.340
at Newhouse Farm, Pantague.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:39.660


00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.320
You know, just go out there and stay when I was a little tot, you know.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.680
Put me on the bus and you put my aunt with me and you in.

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:47.800
How lovely.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:48.520
Yeah.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:52.000
So did you ever get involved in the bottling of milk down there?

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.880
I used to have sometimes and that helped.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:58.420
My father probably used to, you know, mostly he'd do that.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.640
I'd have to come back off the road.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.640
And then wash the bottles and get them ready then to fill up the next morning.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.580
You know, it's, yeah, oh yes.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.500
Oh yes, I've had a very enjoyable life really.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.900
You can tell that.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.040
It shows in your face.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:14.700
It's lovely.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:15.740
Yeah, it does.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.240
What about the poultry?

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.300
Was that an important part of the family?

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:23.440
Yeah, we used to sell eggs on the milk farm quite a lot, you know.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:28.540
And then if there was any surplus eggs then, I used to bring them to the husband brothers

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:37.520
who used to have, well, I don't know, what do you call it, an egg centre that they would have eggs

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.460
and then they'd take them out on different rounds.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.220
Where were the husband brothers based?

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.260
It's in Lysvyn.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.080
Oh really?

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.000
Yes, yes.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.040
But that's all different now altogether.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.440
You know, places change, don't they?

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:51.140
Yeah.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:56.060
Well it's interesting, look at the news photograph, because you must have seen enormous change

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.480
in your lifetime down there.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:02.600
Oh yes, yeah, especially now, more buildings up for stock and everything, you know.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:03.060
Yeah.

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:07.440
And I mean, I used to try and keep it, well, clean, tidy and all this.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.720
And we used to have a boy living in then, you see.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:10.420
Did you?

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:15.060
Yes, yes, you know the, excuse me, you know the kitchen.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.060
You're going for the back door, don't you?

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.300
That's the dining room, the kitchen for every day.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.960
Then there's the kitchen, isn't there?

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.280
Yeah.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.400
Then there's the other room.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.460
We used to have a boy living in there.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.000
Did you?

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.380
Yes, yeah, and he had his bed in there and there was a stove in the corner, we used

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.280
to have for the fire and he had an armchair.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:33.720
Yeah.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.880
He always ate with us.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:35.280
Yeah.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:39.260
And yes, so we always had a boy living in.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:43.140
And who was he, was it a series of people or?

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:48.520
Well yes, different, we had a few from St. Brides that didn't live in, they came back

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.080
and forth, which is, you know, from Cocoonia.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:56.940
But a couple of, they actually lived in there, you know, with us and they'd eat with us and

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.380
all this business, you know.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.620
I mean, he had a television, well not a television, a wireless monitor, but he did have a television

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.660
towards the end.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.180
And yes, we always had a boy living in.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:13.860
I suppose the farm could support that, whereas it would be difficult to do that today, wouldn't

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:13.960
it?

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.900
Well I suppose, yes, it's the different ideas today, isn't it?

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:19.340


00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.420
Yeah, different world today really.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.140
It's a strange lot to really be farming, isn't it?

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:25.820
But did you have sheep then?

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:30.080
Yes, we had some sheep, yeah, pet lambs and something, you know, feed those.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:36.400
Yes, I can't remember how many sheep, we didn't have so many sheep as well now, naturally,

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.900
because we had the dairying as well, you see.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.520
Yes, oh yes, I've enjoyed my life up until now.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.620
So Antem used to go up onto the seawall and bring the sheep in on pony.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.160
Yes.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.840
Did you ever get involved with that?

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.960
No, not really, no, no.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:05.120
Yes, we'd put sheep over on the seawall and then my Doreen, Derek's father, Philip, would

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:09.820
come over and he'd have this horse and a little trap thing, you know, and they'd sit in there

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:14.040
and then they'd go up then to get onto the horse and to bring the sheep up and all this

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:14.680
business, you know.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:20.540
And then one day, I don't know what happened, but anyhow, the pony started kicking the bottom

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:26.460
of the possum and of course got out of the showers and left these four or five of them

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.460
and the possum went backwards while it was suffering.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:31.920
What, backwards down the slope?

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.340
Well, it went back, it went back, back, you know.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:35.360
Oh, I see, because the horse had gone.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.100
There were the showers hanging over them.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:38.960
Were they OK?

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:43.720
Well, they were all right and the dog jumped out a bit quick and the dog was in as well.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:50.080
Oh dear, yeah, they used to come up every Sunday and go down and see the sheep and all

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.260
sorts of those and bring them up.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.360
Because the sheep used to graze on the other side of it.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.500
Yes, yes.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:56.640
So.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:00.720
Until, like, the tide used to come in so far, you know.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:00.840
Yeah.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:06.000
But they hired the, I think they hired the bank then.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:12.700
Yes, they did hire it because of course the sea, the water was coming, the sea was getting

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.060
higher, wasn't it, you know.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:16.740
Because you're very close to the seawall there, aren't you?

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.960
Oh yes, it's only the field really, isn't it?

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:19.080
Yes.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:19.540
The field across.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.360
Did you ever experience the water coming over?

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:26.500
You see it sometimes if it was very rough, just splashing up a bit, you know.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:32.760
That's, you know, I never had the thought in mind of thinking, oh gosh, I hope it doesn't

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.380
come over there.

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.800
I never thought of that.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.120
No.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.600
Which I suppose it has, well, it has in some places over the years, hasn't it, you see.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.700
Did you ever use the shore where the sheet grates?

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.260
Is there like a picnic spot when you had children when they were little?

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:52.280
Yeah, we used to go over there and like a lot of the, have you been over there?

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.680
You've been over there, of course.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:54.240


00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:54.600
Hmm.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.440
I haven't been over there for years really, so I don't know what it's like.

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:03.120
But we used to have little, what's the name of the water coming in, where there's been

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.000
bits and digits.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.400
Yeah, like rivulets.

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.860
Yes, yes, yes.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.080
Hmm.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:11.900
Yeah, yes, we used to go over there with our neighbours, Edins, Snackers Farm, Loose Farm,

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:15.060
that would be, the one just on the side of the road.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:20.720
And, yes, we'd go over there for picnics and, yeah, we used to have a, you know, now and

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.620
again, have a good time.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:30.040
Was it, was it, was there a real sense of community there then?

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:34.540
Down the village, yeah, you mean the village itself?

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.040
Yeah.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:41.660
Oh yes, because those opposite the hall, those are all built, you see, because when

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:45.020
I went down there first, there was no houses there then, you know, so they'd been built.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.800
And at the back of the hall is a little cul-de-sac.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.280
Yeah.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:54.160
That's the council houses further over, they were there when I went down.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:55.280


00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.860
And different houses had been built around there, you know.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:04.520
Yes, oh it's nice, I mean, I'm quite upset really, because WI had been a member for 62

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.560
years down there.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.160
Have you?

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:06.640
Yes.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:10.660
And I used to take my mother-in-law, because she didn't drive, during her mother's

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:11.240
didn't drive.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:17.460
So when then, after lunch, we'd go down on the second Tuesday of the month, I used to

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:21.720
pick her up and we'd go down, because she was president at that time, and there was

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:25.920
the back of the old black stove, I don't know if you've seen the old black stove,

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.180
it was like that.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.260
In the village hall?

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:29.260
In the village hall.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:34.020
And then put the chairs and tables up, and then go back then, and I'd pick her up then

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.520
at sea then to go to WI.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.740
And yes, we did that for years.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:44.540
And then I used to have the milk van then, I had the milk van for a couple of, or for

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:50.180
about a week or more in the afternoons, to go to a place in Bremne to get a sanding machine,

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:56.220
and then put in the back there, and then we'd do the floor, you know, get the floor nice

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.160
and, well, slim you know.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:57.660
Yeah?

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:57.940
Yes.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.660
Oh, we've had some good times down there.

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:00.480
Really good times.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.500
Somebody was telling me that St. Price WI used to have a canning machine.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:06.360
Yes.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.320
Do you know about that?

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:11.000
Yes, yes, and Mother Prosser had it, and where it is I don't know.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.340
Yes, because we used to put fruit into our own canning.

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:15.320
Yes.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:20.880
I wonder where it is, now I've forgotten about that.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.320
I wonder where that is now.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.800
Yes, now I wonder where that is.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.120
You've got me thinking now.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.720
I'll be trying to explore where it is.

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:40.260
So would the WI rent it out, or would they take it out to people and say, do the canning

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.000
for people?

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.100
I couldn't, I can't say that.

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:49.840
I mean, I know we used to borrow it and do our own, at least Mother Prosser did more

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:55.160
than I did, but I'd give a hand, you know, but that's interesting how you brought up

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:55.740
that canning machine.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:56.580
That's going to bother you now.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:57.740
I'd be worried about that.

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.520
It'd be lovely if it's still around somewhere.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.960
Yes, yes it would wouldn't it?

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.680
And it's still going, the St Brides WI?

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.700
St Brides, no, no, it's folded up a long time ago.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:10.260
Oh really?

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:10.700
Yes, yes, yes.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:11.520
Oh that's a shame.

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:17.460
So a lot of the people from there now come to Peterstone, and this is why I'm rather

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.760
upset that Peterstone is talking about folding it.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:20.600
Oh.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:26.940
I mean the secretary, she's moving away down to Swansea, well that's fine, the president,

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:32.780
she did say that she'd do it for another two years, well the two years has come up now,

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.260
and no one else wants to take the responsibility.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:36.720
That's such a shame.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:38.340
It is a shame, it is a shame.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.660
And it's been going how long?

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.180
Well I've been down there 62 years.

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.240
That's phenomenal, Margaret.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.500
And it was on a long time before that.

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:47.400
Oh.

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:48.740
Yes, it's sad really.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.620
How many members have you got down there?

00:26:51.880 --> 00:27:00.620
There's, from St Brides area, around Asda where people live, I expect there's 14 people

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:07.840
come from that area, and it seems such a shame that no one will take it on.

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.060
After all that time?

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:15.460
Yes, it is, because I was president for about seven years after Mother Pross has given it

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:19.180
up, I don't know how long she was, but no, it's quite sad.

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:27.380
I was quite upset about it really, but I'm hoping that I might join Kevin Madley, Michael

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:33.380
Stoneman, which is nearer, but the distance didn't make any difference to me.

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:35.260
It's a longevity though isn't it?

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:39.120
Winds and weathers, pick up a couple of ladies from our school on the way down.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:39.920
Oh, how sweet.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.680
Yes, you just enjoy it.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.220
That's how it goes, isn't it?

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:49.220
So you said Mother Pross used to can fruit.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:50.460
Yes.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.200
Where did her fruit come from?

00:27:52.580 --> 00:28:00.720
Oh well, we had plum trees, we had trees, we had plum trees, and we had a couple of trees around here,

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:08.900
plum trees and things, and well, that was our garden then, you know, and then we'd have beans and stuff like that,

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:10.360
you know, to roast it.

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.340
But yeah, I've forgotten about that canning machine.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.260
So what was the process then?

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.840
So you'd pick the fruit and then wash it?

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:26.620
Yes, and then make a syrup, and then put it in the tins, and then with the machine you'd seal it all,

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.540
and that would be your tinned fruit.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.640
Gosh, and that would last all the winter?

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:35.320
Well yes, if you make as much as you can, you know, or we could.

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:39.840
And yes, gosh, I'm glad you thought about the canning machine.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.520
You've got me worried now.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.320
Well it's come up a few times, you see, so I thought, I'm curious.

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.160
I've never heard of a canning machine before.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.640
And that St. Bride's WI has a canning machine.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.140
It just sounds really resourceful to me.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:58.300
Yes, that's right. Yes, yes. I wonder where that is now.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:08.000
Did the WI, because in the past the WI has been absolutely fantastic at recording local people and their memories,

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.840
did the St. Bride's WI ever do anything like that?

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:17.700
No, they folded up as I said, and a couple of them came from there then, which are a few more now,

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:22.360
because the president it is now, she lives in one of the houses by our stairs,

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.920
and of course a couple of her friends have come as well.

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:29.920
As I say, I was quite upset last week when I knew it was going to fold up.

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:30.920
Oh, that is upsetting.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:31.640
Yes, it is.

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:34.920
But there we are, people are not interested.

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:38.320
You can't force people to be.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.120
You can't.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.240
You can try and encourage.

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:49.160
So as a young woman, a young wife, was it part of one's social life, the WI?

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.240
It was really.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:55.240
Yes, yes, I went up to London for the two AGMs.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:03.600
WI was something that you did as a young wife, and you have continued to do for a long time.

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:13.320
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, I enjoyed WI. I went to London to the AGM on two occasions, which is up at the Albert Hall,

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.600
and that was very interesting, where they come from all over the country.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.860
Yes, it's gone back a bit.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:27.420
But what struck me about down on the moors there, that it's quite a different landscape, isn't it?

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.720
It's flat, all the water courses.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:30.120
Oh yes, yes.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.460
Was that a challenge in some way?

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:37.200
I don't know whether you were a friend, because there's people living in the church now,

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:43.940
and on about, what am I, five foot, am I five foot or nothing?

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:49.860
It's up about, well I should know the place, where the Great Flood was.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:50.740
Yes, yes.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:58.540
Yes, and the bank, you can see the bank, now we're one of the fields of one of the farms up, as you go down the road a bit.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:30:59.360


00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:06.400
Yes, well I think I'm right in saying that the water more or less came up nearly up to Cancelledon.

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.320
Yes, because it goes down, doesn't it, apparently?

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.460
Yes, yes, it's very low, very low.

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.540
Did you ever experience flooding there?

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:20.820
No, no. The rains would fill up quite a bit, you know, but no, no, we never had any flooding as such, no.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:25.240
What was it like having young children around those things though? Was it ever a worry?

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:36.740
Oh yes, yes. Now the neighbours, on that farm down to West Farm then, they lost a child that drowned in the water.

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:42.180
And also in St Brides, the child drowned in St Brides in the rain.

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:42.700
Oh really?

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:50.440
Yes, yes. But I suppose if you're born down there you get used to it.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:32:04.800
I know the one that came down further on down the road was from London, came down to see the sister, came down and brought the little one, of course went down the steps and drowned in the rain there, you know, which was very sad.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.580
Oh gosh, that's so sad, isn't it?

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:10.740
Terrible, terrible. Yes, but...

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:15.560
When you first went to Sleuth's Farm, was there electricity and stuff?

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:20.060
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, because when I lived in Langorce we had no electric.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:20.680
No?

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:32.820
I got the Aladdin lamp there, the hanging Aladdin lamp, and I've got a little table lamp that's in there, that's with oil, and we didn't have any hot water, cold water, anything like that.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:37.560
Can you talk about the winter of 47? What was the winter of 62, 63 like?

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.240
I was down here then, of course.

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:40.940
Oh here?

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.580
Yes, it was bad then.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:50.980
I used to go up to Castleton with the tractor to have the lorry to come down, you know, to bring it down.

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:51.480
Really?

00:32:51.480 --> 00:33:04.460
And then in the evenings then, a couple of the locals there, the youngsters, they'd take me down the six bells on a big boat, drag it down the road, you know.

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:09.640
Oh yes, we had quite a lot of snow. Yes, yes, yes, but we had more when we were in Langorce.

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:16.780
I can remember seeing on Pennavan, down one of the crevices, in June, there was still snow.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:17.600
Really?

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:18.820
I can see that now.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.700
My goodness. It went on and on and on, didn't it?

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:21.860
Oh it did, it did.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:24.960
Did anyone ever go skating on the Reens or anything like that?

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:34.780
On the lake. Oh sorry, on Langorce Lake they used to go, but I mean, well it was frozen over and a motorbike went across and it's never known before.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:35.340
Really?

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:36.660
It went across the other side.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.100
I've never heard that before.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:43.500
Yeah, they rep me did. But yes, I should say, but many did freeze, didn't they?

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:44.060
Yeah.

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:53.320
You know, it's just, and yeah, we used to go, we used to go and, a crowd of us, we lived in Langorce, we used to take one of these little boats,

00:33:53.680 --> 00:34:00.420
we used to go down to the other side of Langorce, Langasty, and I don't know, even with Langorce.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:07.940
And if you look across there, there's a little hall, about three feet from the end of the river, I'll say, and Langasty Hall,

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:15.620
and we used to go across there to dances, and we'd take one of these gift boats, you know, and we used to row across there.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:16.480
Did you really?

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:16.560
Yeah.

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.540
That's quite some distance.

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:23.360
Yes, it was really, back when you were younger, no, just distance, dear, I wouldn't do it now.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:29.840
And we used to tether it there and walk up these two feet, go to the dance, come back, then and row back.

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:36.120
My goodness, imagine if my daughter was doing that, I'd be, you know, it's good our parents don't know what we're doing.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.220
Yeah, yeah, what we used to do then years ago when we were young.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:45.280
Do you remember the, did you ever help with haymaking as a young farmer's wife?

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:54.580
Well, yes, dry the tractor perhaps and that, you know, the baling, and of course we had a photograph, I don't know,

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:59.140
I might have got a photograph here where, excuse me.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.020
What's this prize here then, Margaret?

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:07.760
Well, this is when I was first lady chairman of St. Mannon's show.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.080
Now, that was a big show, someone said to me.

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:16.640
Oh, yes, oh, it was lovely, oh, yes, fair play, it was, no, no, I still look forward to St. Mannon's show.

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:23.280
So is it a very strong farming community? Is it a very close-knit farming community?

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:28.220
Yes, I think so, yes, yes, you know, we do a lot of things together.

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:37.280
We had two donkeys and this donkey down Slose and then we put her in full and oh,

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:40.580
you've never seen such sweet things when this little one came.

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.800
I think the whole village came down to see it.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:43.160
Really?

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.740
Oh, just the deal thing.

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:48.700
Someone told me that farmers kept donkeys because they were good luck.

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:54.700
Well, yes, they, they, they, they do, a lot of people had donkeys with the cattle.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.460
Hmm, I've never heard that before.

00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:03.420
Yes, yes, I don't know whether it's, oh, there's the, I spent it this hand, this one, ten grand.

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:03.580


00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:07.780
This is in 1955, I sold my sheep and I bought the little sports car.

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:10.080
Is that you?

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:14.420
Yeah, no, that's not me, that's my mother and my aunt, but that's the little car I bought.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:15.400
You bought it?

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.580
Yes, I sold the sheep and I bought the little car.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:23.180
Oh, I think that's so impressive. That must have been very unusual for a young woman there.

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:27.340
Oh, yeah, we used to have some fun. We used to go following the hounds.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:27.920
Did you?

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:37.720
Yes, on the top there and, yeah, and then one day, walking back to the car and here comes the local policeman with a steering wheel in his hand.

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:39.740
He'd take the steering wheel off.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:40.240
Why?

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.780
I went to Blackpool in that and back.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:46.040
Oh my goodness, you and me, what sort of car is it?

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:51.800
It was a, a built-up Le Mans, the Singer. It had a Singer engine.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:58.400
I am so impressed with you. Oh my goodness. And then you followed the hounds down on the moors?

00:36:58.580 --> 00:36:59.280
Yes, yeah.

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:01.100
Really? Derek was telling me about that.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.960
Yes, yes, the Tredegar Hunt.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.940
Oh, so where would you go?

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:12.220
And the Tredegar Hunt was based in Beyslech, but it's all been built on now.

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:12.640
Yeah?

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:16.560
So they've gone up to Gelligeir, the hounds up there.

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:16.940
Yeah.

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:21.480
So, I mean, we use them if we have dead stock or something.

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:21.820
Yeah.

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:25.860
We pay so much a year for them to pick it up, to take it up to the, you know, us, them, you know.

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.360
But then you would follow them in your car, would you?

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:28.620
Yeah, yeah.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.280
And who would you do that with?

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.700
On the top of Penelan, I don't know, Penelan.

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:32.960
Yeah.

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:34.280
Up there, we'd be up there.

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.980
It's like an orchard there.

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.600
Yes, yes, we used to have trees.

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.540
So did you get apples off those as well?

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.060
Yes, apples and pears.

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.320
Did you ever make cider from them?

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.280
No, no, but we used to can them.

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:47.840
Can them?

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:49.580
Gosh, that's lovely.

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.020
So where was the orchard then?

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:52.440
This was my...

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.100
So where was the orchard here?

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:54.880
There.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:55.980
Oh, gosh.

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:56.540
Yes.

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:57.160
Okay.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.260
And this was my garden out by here.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:04.260
Did you ever have horses on your farm?

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:05.640
No.

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:06.260
No.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:06.900
No.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.080
No, just the two donkeys.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:09.140
Oh, we did...

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:10.860
Oh gosh, that's me when I was...

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:12.160
Oh, I shouldn't be showing you this.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.120
This is 1951.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:13.760
Oh, please do.

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:17.980
I represented Langorce in Breckenshire.

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:19.740
Really?

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:24.580
So when it was haymaking, would you have had to make all the lunches for everyone coming

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:25.620
in who was helping with the haymaking?

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:30.000
Yes, usually in the evening I'd cook ham, potatoes and stuff like that.

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:31.860
They'd come in at a separate time.

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:32.500
Yes.

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:33.620
Not so much in the daytime.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.080
I mean, they'd have someone to eat sandwiches or something.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:36.420


00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:39.320
But I used to cook dinner in the evening for them to come in.

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:40.600
Yes, and they'd come back.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:40.800
Oh.

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:44.060
Yes, we had a lovely life really.

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:44.940
And that was me.

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:50.360
So did you ever... you were probably then too young to have ever thatched hay ricks then

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:50.940
and stuff?

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:54.480
Well, yes, I've seen them done.

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:55.240
Have you?

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:55.820
Yes.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.420
When I was up, my grandparents, they used to do it there.

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:04.140
But of course we've always had the bands and of course the bales now, but we used to do

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:05.140
small bales.

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:05.600
Yes.

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:11.220
I think there's a certain amount of small bales now, if I remember rightly, because

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:12.720
it's the round ones now, isn't it?

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:13.620
Yes, of course.

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:15.120
Yes, big round ones.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.900
Yes, all times have altered.

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:21.560
So was there any... there's something I've been meaning to ask and I've forgotten to

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:29.600
ask everybody else, but was there... excuse me... any food or meals?

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:37.900
So for example, my parents are Irish and a traditional meal we would have would be boiled

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:44.280
ham, parsley sauce and something called chump, which was potatoes and onions and cabbage.

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:44.920
Yes, yes.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:48.040
Is there anything on the morse that was traditional like that?

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.540
Any particular dishes or...?

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:51.060
I used to always boil ham.

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:51.720
Yes.

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:55.880
You know, I liked boiled ham, sliced and potatoes and stuff like that.

00:39:56.580 --> 00:40:05.700
No, I suppose... I think it's a thing that's... a farmhouse meal, isn't it?

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:05.960
Yes.

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:12.440
Boiled ham, potatoes, peas, parsley sauce, you know, that type of thing, isn't it?

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:16.800
So you would always be in the kitchen providing food for people working on the farm?

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:18.560
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.440
Oh yes, yes.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.480
Yes, yes.

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:25.260
And yes, I used to go out and feed the children with the chicken in there.

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:27.680
I used to feed the poultry and all that.

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:34.420
But yes, and they'd come in then about two-waps, ten, eleven o'clock and then they'd sit down

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:37.300
and have supper and then they'd go about twelve o'clock, one o'clock.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:38.320
Wow.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:40.040
Yes, yes.

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.240
I used to enjoy the haymaking.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.200
The harvest time used to be lovely.

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:46.000
Why did you like it?

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:47.480
Because it was just a...

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:53.880
Well, me too, they used to come in and have a rest and then, you know, we'd go haul in

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:57.000
the bales and all this business, you know, the loose hay years ago.

00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:57.540
Yeah.

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.480
I thought I had a photograph here of...

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:01.540
I haven't got one.

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:04.480
I thought I had a photograph here of the...

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.000
Oh, what was it?

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:10.440
So do you remember any of the people who used to work for the drainage board that used to

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.640
come round and clear the reams and stuff?

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:16.280
Erm...

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.400
Oh dear, what was his name?

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:17.980
Hmm.

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:20.440
I can see him now.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:21.300
Oh really?

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:24.860
Oh.

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.280
Oh, they're looking to me in a moment.

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:30.800
Yes, he was just slashed over the long-handled hook.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:31.780
Oh, do you remember that?

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:32.280
Down the Broadway.

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:32.900
Yeah.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.100
Down the Broadway particularly.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:34.660
Hmm.

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:36.160
Erm...

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:36.600
Oh.

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.240
Ha ha.

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.960
Well, the one that's died now, a couple of months ago.

00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:45.460
Hmm.

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:47.240
Erm...

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:48.960
Oh.

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:50.260
Hmm.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:51.960
I can't think of the other gentleman.

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:54.680
I can see him now doing it, you know.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.080
Well, that's silly, isn't it?

00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:58.760
It'll come to you.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.480
It'll come.

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:00.220
Yeah.

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.380
And so Dilwyn was on the drainage board?

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:05.460
Yeah, Dilwyn was on the drainage board and his father was before him.

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:05.960
Yeah.

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:07.300
So what did that mean?

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:11.480
Does it mean just, you know, was it an important role?

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:13.000
Erm...

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.500
Well, I suppose it controlled the reams and everything really, wasn't it?

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.420
The drainage board more or less, you know.

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:24.480
It's to see that they were cut and the reeds were cut and everything from off the sides.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:24.880


00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.360
Or something.

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:29.220
And I suppose control the gates.

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:29.680
Yes.

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:32.860
It opened out opposite the bottom of the Broadway.

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:33.620
Yes.

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.320
The gates are automatic.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.860
It's all automatic now, you see.

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:37.280
Yeah.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.240
Years ago it used to have you be done more or less by hands.

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:40.540
Yeah.

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:41.180
You know.

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:45.340
So it's the most very interesting really.

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:46.280
Hmm.

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:48.780
Very interesting, aren't they, in different things?

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:49.500
I think so.

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.180
I think it's fascinating actually.

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:51.380


00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:51.420
Yes.

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:52.040
It's very different.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:53.420
What about fish?

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:57.140
Did you ever get eels in the ream or...?

00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:58.200
Oh yes, yes.

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:01.200
Down the bottom of the dry out sluice, you know.

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:01.420
Yeah.

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:02.920
Used to have eels out of there.

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:03.480
Did you?

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:04.640
Yes, yes.

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:05.120
Hmm.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:06.220
What, you used to cook them?

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:07.880
Oh yes, I used to love eating them.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:08.800
Really?

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.620
So how did you catch them and cook them?

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.620
Oh you'd catch them, you know, you'd catch them with a...

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:16.320
A rod?

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:16.740
A rod.

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:17.220
Yeah.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.820
And put them on the end of it, you know.

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:18.920
Yeah.

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:19.620
Catch them like that.

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:21.100
And you'd put them in a bucket then.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:21.520
Yeah.

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:27.100
So as, you know, they'd have fresh water, so you'd kill them and eat them.

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:27.780
How long would you...?

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:28.640
I wouldn't.

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:29.740
He wouldn't.

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:30.200
Oh no.

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.460
But you would keep them in the fresh bucket for a few days, fresh with water?

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:36.620
Oh yes, change the water for a day or two so as they get the...

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:37.900
The earthy stuff.

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:39.240
The earthy stuff.

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:39.560
Yeah.

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.440
Otherwise you'd be eating earth.

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:42.680
So you would do that?

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:43.160
Yeah.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:43.820
Really?

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:44.400
Yeah.

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.020
And then you would skin it?

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.860
Skin it and then cook it, fry it in the frying pan, chop it up in bits.

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:50.700
Really?

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:52.480
But they were very keen.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.240
I mean, I enjoy anything.

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:54.960
Yeah?

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:56.700
Or everything, put it that way.

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:57.160
Yeah?

00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:58.080
I'm not...

00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.300
First, even my food I enjoy a lot.

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.500
That's a good free source of food though.

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:02.880
Yeah, it is, yes.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.140
What about Elvis?

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.260
Was that something anyone ever had down there?

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:06.760
No.

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:07.240
No.

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:08.320
I don't think so.

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:09.300
No, no.

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:16.720
Down the bottom end of the drive of Boston, you have them down there.

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:16.960
Yeah.

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.600
And you get them up through the...

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.260
You know, up the piers you get them in the...

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:22.680
The Bostons.

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:23.380
Did you?

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:23.840
Hmm.

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:24.320
Pretty.

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.260
Yes, yeah.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:26.320
Crikey.

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:26.720


00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:28.900
Oh yes, it's...

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:32.100
It's fascinating to read it, you know, when you think back what you've seen and done.

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:33.660
What about church?

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:37.180
Did your family ever go to church, you know, when you were down living on...

00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:40.480
Yes, I used to go to St. Peter's Church, which is the big church in the village.

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:40.900
Yeah.

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:42.160
But of course that closed.

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:42.860


00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:45.280
And it's a house now, person.

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.140
Is that something the whole family would go to?

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:52.660
Yes, Sunday morning we used to try and go to church on a Sunday evening.

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:53.120


00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.340
I mean, Father Prosser was a church warden there.

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:55.940
Was he?

00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:56.340
His father.

00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:56.980
Yeah.

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.400
Oh yes, he was a big churchman.

00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.180
Was he?

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:00.120
Yes, yes.

00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:02.120
And Mother used to go, Mother Prosser used to go.

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:02.620
Yeah.

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:08.640
And they were on occasion and they were married in Peterstone Church.

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:12.820
But of course it closed then, a little while after.

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:16.780
And it's a house now, people's got it as a house.

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:22.700
They were living in there, I don't know, unfortunately the gentleman died now only last year.

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:25.660
His wife and the child are still there.

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.620
But apparently they were...

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.060
I've never been in a sense, naturally.

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:31.860
But they were living in pods.

00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:33.220
Were they?

00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:38.080
It's a big church, man, it's huge, high, cropped, tremendous height.

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:38.560


00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.620
Been up the top of the tower, lovely view from there.

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:42.080
Really?

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:43.980
Yeah.

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.460
Would the congregation have been very big?

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:50.680
Well yes, it varied then.

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:58.200
You know, it's like Marshfield is a bigger church, or they do get more congregation there.

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.300
Because I suppose it's in a bigger village, isn't it?

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:03.120
And that's a nice church too, St Mary's Church.

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:09.600
I've got a rose tree down there for doing, but I've also got a casket up in the field up here.

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:10.260
Have you?

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:12.080
Of his ashes, yes.

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:18.680
Do you remember any characters that stand out for you that you remember?

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.620
Well, before the buildings that are over the other side of the road now, there were buildings, but not like they are now.

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:28.420
And there used to be an old fellow living in there.

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:28.840
Yeah.

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:31.420
And Dennis his name was.

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.800
And he used to wear a long, long coat.

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:41.380
He lived in there and there was a grate in the corner, where you'd have a bit of a fireplace if you wanted it.

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:46.920
And Dennis, and he'd walk from there then into town, or Romney, and walk back.

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:48.880
I can see him now, it was in the stages ago.

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:49.320
Yeah.

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.080
But he had this long, long black coat.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:58.060
And then there was another one down at the farm down at St Brides.

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:02.960
And his name was, he was another character.

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:07.980
I'm trying to think of his name.

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.060
He lived in a barn.

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:16.540
I don't like to use the word tramp, but kind of like just somebody who used to.

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:21.220
Well, they were, yes, they were kind of a tramp type of person, you know.

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:22.140
Yeah.

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:23.700
Billy Mitch, that was down there.

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:28.600
That's right, and Dennis used to be in this one, in our barn over there.

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:38.460
No trouble, I mean, you know, actually I think Father Prosser went over there one day and he died in the last time.

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:39.380
Really?

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:41.040
So he had to get the police and all up his back.

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:41.760
Yeah.

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:46.220
But, no, there were characters about then, weren't there?

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:47.840
Years ago, like that.

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:53.760
I can see them, I can place them now.

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:55.740
It's gone back a little while.

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:59.260
Yes, Dennis and Billy Mitch used to call him.

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:06.560
And they reckoned that if the airplanes were coming over during the war, because that was when he was there during the war,

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:09.940
he'd turn his pipe upside down in cases.

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.420
Oh, isn't that lovely?

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:14.180
Yeah, yeah.

00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:18.160
It's a compliment when you think it was a nice thing, because they made a huge pipe.

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:19.360
Oh, right.

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:23.460
Oh, Jesus, really funny, yeah.

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:27.700
Someone was telling me, now, where was it now?

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:29.700
I can't remember.

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:36.420
Oh, something about that, was it St. Brides or was it somewhere else?

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:40.960
I might be wrong, but on the Sunday the pubs used to be closed in Wales.

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:46.840
This is when the border was different, so people used to flood over to here to use the pubs on the Sunday.

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:47.760
Is that right?

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:49.400
Maybe I've got that wrong.

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:57.980
No, they used to, there was a law, wasn't there, where the pubs used to close in a lot of places.

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:03.300
But I can't remember where that was.

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.540
I might have got that wrong, actually.

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:11.160
I feel very sad, really, the six bars was closed.

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:11.660
Yeah.

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:16.820
There was two cottages at the side of that.

00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:20.860
Was it a popular pub?

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:21.960
Oh, yes.

00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:26.200
We've had a lot of lovely times down there, especially Christmas time.

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:31.720
We'd go down there and somebody would be playing the organ, have a good old sing-song and that.

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:35.660
Oh, I think I've got a photograph.

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:37.880
I'm boring you with these photographs.

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:42.100
You are not. I love photographs, Margaret. I really do love photographs.

00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:49.940
This is the six bars with all the horses.

00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:54.320
No, that's interesting. I think I might have seen that photograph before.

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:55.200
Have you, maybe?

00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:58.660
No, I think.

00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:00.700
He was no master.

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:04.560
So what hunt, which pack is this?

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:10.220
This would be the, what's it, Tredegar.

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:10.940
Tredegar?

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.180
Tredegar Hunt, yes.

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.120
And this is the one you used to follow in your sports car?

00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.900
Yeah. Yes, that's right, yes.

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:19.020
Oh, and who's this?

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:22.120
Do you know where this is taken?

00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:24.480
No, I'm not certain of that.

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:28.280
Yes, and let's see, there was two cottages at the side of the six bars.

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.480
Oh, yes, yes.

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:34.160
And then this is, what was this, Cairn Filp?

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:37.140
Oh, I don't know, last year.

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:39.480
Because it looks like it's been closed for years, doesn't it?

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:41.660
Yes, it does, yes. It looks a bit messed up.

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:42.460
Yeah, yeah.

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:45.080
Yes, it's a shame because we've had a lot of fun down there.

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:46.100


00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:49.380
I just, thinking about St. Melan's show.

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:51.200
Yes, that's folded now.

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:54.300
That's folded, but I understand that was a huge event in its time.

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:58.640
Yes, yes, it was very good. We had tremendous times with the show.

00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:04.620
We used to be on the, first of all, St. Melan's show was to be at Rimley,

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:07.200
on the top of Rimley Hill.

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:12.340
And then it came then to, oh, what's there now?

00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:17.180
Oh, the only one, Cud Curnow.

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:19.440
Bakers used to have the farm.

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:25.620
Oh, well all these, oh dear, I can't think of the name.

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.100
Oh, that's silly, isn't it?

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:32.100
You know, when you go down now towards Newport,

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:35.740
all these buildings on the right-hand side and this left-hand side.

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.380
Like a radiator plant and stuff.

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:38.720
That's right, that's right, yes.

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:40.480
We used to have the show there.

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:41.280
Did you?

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:44.000
And then we came then to Cairn Mabley here down the bottom of this lane

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.620
where you came over the bridge by the farm park.

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:48.140
We used to have it there.

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:48.640
Oh, really?

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:49.920
Yes, in the big field there.

00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:50.860


00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:55.280
And, oh yes, and then we went then to Jadika House.

00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:55.800
Yes.

00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:58.240
But it was never the same, not really.

00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.280
You know, we used to get, I don't know why it was,

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:02.540
because it was a nice site,

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:06.500
but we didn't get the agricultural side of things.

00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:07.680
Yes, it changed.

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.040
It changed altogether.

00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:12.340
So where it used to be by Coy Curnow,

00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:15.120
what was it, so where that area is now,

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.660
it's completely developed, isn't it?

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:17.480
Oh yes, yes.

00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:18.780
Was it just farmland then?

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.200
It was farmland, yes.

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:21.580
It's hard to imagine.

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:22.760
It is, it is.

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:26.580
So before the motorway and everything, it was...

00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:27.880
Yes, well of course they were talking,

00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:31.800
they were putting another road up onto the motorway.

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:32.560
Yeah.

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.160
I don't know whether it's going to happen, I don't know.

00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:35.560
But it was just farmland?

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.900
Yes, yes, because it was still there.

00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:41.500
And it was where all the local farmers would go along there,

00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:44.860
would they to present, show their livestock?

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:45.600
Yes, oh yes.

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:46.720
It was a proper agriculture show?

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:49.360
Oh yes, it was, definitely, everything was there.

00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:50.120


00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:54.020
And the local show now is Macken Show.

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:54.680
Okay.

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:56.820
And that's always on the first Saturday of July.

00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:57.320
Yeah.

00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:58.380
And that's a nice little show.

00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:58.860
Yeah.

00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:01.360
And that's as big as what St. Melan's was, you know.

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:05.600
But, oh yes, oh yes, we've had a lot of fun at the shows.

00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:06.820
Yeah, lovely.

00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:09.820
But there, things have altered, haven't they, over the years?

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:10.600
Yeah, they do.

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:11.600
You know.

00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:14.220
I was just going to ask you about the lighthouse pub.

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:17.540
Is that something that locals would have ever used?

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:20.200
Was it something people from out of town would use?

00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:23.180
Have you been down to the lighthouse pub?

00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:23.560
Yeah.

00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:24.540
Oh, it was very pleasant.

00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:27.860
And a lot of people used to walk on the bank, you know, across the bank.

00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:28.420
Really?

00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:29.240
Mm-hmm.

00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:32.680
But would people walk along from the Cardiff along here?

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:35.840
Yes, well, yes, sort of from Remney perhaps, you know, walk.

00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:36.260


00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:38.240
And then you would see them go back and that, you know.

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:39.500
Oh, yes, yeah.

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:41.160
Oh, it was very pleasant on there.

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:41.940
It was a nice day.

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:42.640
Yeah, it is.

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:43.080
It's nice.

00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:46.100
You know, it's, you go up and you can see both sides.

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:47.040


00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:55.560
I'm sure he was telling me that, that people used to stay in almost like a chalet, seat

00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:59.600
shack in, in, on the, by the sea wall.

00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:00.480
Is that right?

00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:01.180
At St. Brides.

00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:02.180
At St. Brides?

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:02.580
Yes.

00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:03.160
Or was it?

00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:04.980
They've got caravans there now.

00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:10.100
I don't think he meant the caravan, that people would rent out, would come out for the weekend

00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:12.480
and maybe he did mean the caravan actually.

00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:14.580
I didn't think he did mean that.

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:15.960
Maybe I got that wrong.

00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:20.480
He said people would come out for the day on their bikes and...

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.740
Oh, a lot of people used to go to St. Brides.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:23.240
Really?

00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:23.920
Yes, yes.

00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:24.280
Yeah.

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:25.580
Yes.

00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:29.020
And of course they'd have these little tent things, wouldn't they?

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:29.500
Oh, really?

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:30.940
Yes, yes.

00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:32.160
You see those, don't they?

00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:33.620
What, like people would camp?

00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:36.560
Yes, yes, they'd sleep in there and then, you know...

00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:36.560


00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:39.280
But along by the wall or...?

00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:44.800
Not so much at all, but before they put the caravan site, because there's a fair bit of

00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:48.060
caravan site at St. Brides apparently, which I haven't been there for years.

00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:49.260
Excuse me.

00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:55.080
And they used to have these little tent things, you know, you see it on the television, don't

00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:55.180
they?

00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:56.080
Really?

00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:56.580
Yes.

00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:59.100
Oh, I didn't know that.

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.500
Yes, yes, times have changed, haven't they?

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:03.720
Yes, they have.

00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:04.460
They have.

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:05.200


00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:08.260
I just have one thing I have to ask you about, because I was asking about it, because part

00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:15.060
of what I'm doing is talking to people who live along the moors, but that includes people

00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:16.500
from the Gypsy community.

00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.980
Do you remember any Gypsies coming through?

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:27.920
Well, when we had ground, we had ventured ground on the corner down in Simpra, I think,

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:35.080
down where the Gypsy caravan site is now.

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:36.920
There used to be the old...

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:39.920
She was an old Gypsy in the proper old...

00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:41.860
Rantel?

00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:42.340
Yes.

00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:47.120
And they were there for years on the corner of our field, and we used to have to just

00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:50.780
pass them, you know, to go into the field, and they'd give no trouble at all.

00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:52.580
But these are not Gypsies, are they?

00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:54.500
Not being unkind, they're travellers.

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:54.820
No, I know.

00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:55.860
Yes, yes.

00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:56.160
You know.

00:55:56.560 --> 00:56:03.480
And I mean, they got horses tethered, and a friend of mine, she saw this little tiny

00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:06.800
pony one day, and she thought the pole was in a hole, sweet.

00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:10.080
She came home and took some hay down to give it on the road.

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:10.080


00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:12.060
You know, it's sad.

00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:13.840
No, these are travellers more, I think.

00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:17.760
You know, they're not the proper Gypsy, I don't think.

00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:19.700
There we are.

00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:21.140
That's life, I suppose, isn't it?

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:22.260
It is, I suppose.

00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:24.380
And there's so many of them now, isn't there?

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:29.120
So do you know, you go towards Cardiff and Rumley from where it lives now.

00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:29.500
Yes.

00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:34.560
I mean, again, when you first arrived, was that just agricultural land?

00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:35.980
Oh yes, all just fields.

00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:39.020
It's hard for me to imagine.

00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:40.440
Yes, yes, yes.

00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:46.640
Yes, and of course there was the KLG, which is a bit firm opposite, isn't there?

00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:47.880
Yeah.

00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:49.500
Doing motor things.

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:53.460
But, oh yes, it was all, it's most unfortunate.

00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:58.460
I mean, there's a little house there as you go down towards the caravan site.

00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:03.080
On the right-hand side, he was the coalman, Mrs Sadler.

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:11.320
And I look at it now and I think to myself, oh, if he came back and saw us, yeah, he'd be very, very upset about it, you know.

00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.340
He was the coalman.

00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:13.900
Yes.

00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:14.760
So he delivered the coal?

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:15.500
Yes, he delivered the coal.

00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:17.280
Yes, he had the bags of coal.

00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:18.500


00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:19.460
So.

00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:20.720
Mrs Sadler.

00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:23.720
His son is still alive and he lives in Bramney.

00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:24.960
Oh.

00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:26.540
I've seen him for some time, actually.

00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:29.620
But as the house was, it was a maclet, you know.

00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:34.680
But as it is now, the slate's gone and it's a mess.

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:36.240
He'd break his heart.

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:41.020
Do you remember a nurse, I'm sure it was Nurse Cox, she was the midwife.

00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:43.460
Oh yes, yes, yes.

00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:46.660
Now, she lived on the top of Penderland, didn't she?

00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:47.760
That's right.

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:55.340
There were two cottages there and I'm very friendly with Betty Stevens, her name is now, she was Betty Bridge.

00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:58.840
She lived in there, one of those, and her brother.

00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:02.800
And those, what of course, are they gone?

00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:04.480
Yes, Nurse Cox.

00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:09.480
And there was another nurse, she lived up there too, because Nurse Cox moved down to Castleton.

00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:10.320
Yes.

00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:14.220
On the left-hand side, as you go down off the main road.

00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:17.380
Oh yes, she used to go around delivering the babies.

00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:20.800
Yeah, did she deliver Andrew and your daughter?

00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:22.840
No, I went into Glossop.

00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:23.580
Oh, did you?

00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:25.480
Yes, yes, I went into Glossop Tens.

00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:26.020
Yeah.

00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:28.800
I just said it with both of them, actually.

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:34.100
But, yes, you bring back memories for me as well.

00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:36.380
Oh, well I met her...

00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:41.040
Well, I suppose we've got hedgerows here, where as down there, there's the reams.

00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:41.660
Ah.

00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:42.440
You know.

00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:42.840
Yeah.

00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:45.960
But not really, I suppose, no.

00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:47.780
No, the grass is green.

00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:49.240
Yeah, yeah.

00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:51.700
And you drove a tractor from Iorlion?

00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:53.700
Oh yes, yes, yes.

00:58:54.120 --> 00:59:02.900
I drove, when we moved from Langhorst down to Berryhill, and Ferguson, Ferguson, 25, excuse me.

00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:08.060
I did three journeys from Langhorst down to Berryhill, and took me four and a half hours.

00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:09.140
Really?

00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:13.080
With the trailer behind, with implements and stuff, brought them down to Berryhill Farm.

00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:20.080
And then when I was going back, do you know the way, do you know Pontypool area, which...

00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:23.020
I've been to Pontyboil recently.

00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:23.780
Pontyboil?

00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:24.160
Yeah.

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:25.000
Oh, right, yeah.

00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:30.120
Well, when you go, it wasn't the new road then, because we wouldn't have been able to go on the new road anyway.

00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:30.580
Yeah.

00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:33.840
We wouldn't be able to go on the motorway, you know, with the tractor.

00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:34.400


00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:35.620
The same then.

00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:42.360
And I used to go down past the horse and jockey on the bottom, and I used to go down the hill and knock it out of gear,

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:44.500
and go down that hill like the crappers.

00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:48.120
And I often think, well, what if something came across the road?

00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:49.540
I wouldn't have a chance.

00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:50.260
Oh my goodness.

00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:51.820
You do things when you're young, don't you?

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:52.600
Yeah.

00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:56.180
Yeah, I did three journeys, that.

00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:59.800
I brought the plough up, and I brought a big trailer up with implements on.

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:02.940
And, yes, it took me four and a half hours.

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:04.720
And were you the only child?

01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:05.260
Yes.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:05.920
Ah.

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.100
I haven't even got a cousin.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:08.240
Really?

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.380
No, because my two aunts didn't marry.

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.180
My one aunt did marry, but she didn't have any family.

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:16.020
And then my uncle, he married.
