00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.900
I worked on an elderly ward, so that was about 30 beds,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.080
a few males with dementia.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.780
And that had a Florence, like the Nightingale ward,

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.300
so you could see everybody there.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.260
The new staff, I worked mainly nights there,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.660
so there'd be two staff on night, 30 patients.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.940
It was hard work, but I think, I don't know whether

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.060
it was okay, it was okay.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:38.180
It was very regimented, you knew who was doing what at a certain time.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.140
Then we used to have to mop the floors.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.140
I just remember in this ward, cockroaches.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.320
I remember watching a panorama program a few years later

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.720
and seeing that these were big cockroaches.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.440
There were big cockroaches there.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.300
So we used to have to mop the floor.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.800
If you'd put the light on in certain areas, you could hear them.
