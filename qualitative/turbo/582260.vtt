00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020
And many of the children there at that time didn't go out at all.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.460
They never left the hospital premises.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.840
So one of the things she did was to take them to the swimming pool at Guildford Crescent.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.800
And this is gone now.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.080
It's a Chinese restaurant or hotel or something now.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.840
But she used to take them once a week down to the...

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.500
And that was the first time many of them had ever been out.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.660
And it was a struggle to do because she used to have to go on the bus with the children.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.060
And I used to go with her and used to come back on the bus.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.500
And people in the public were sometimes quite...

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.000
I wouldn't say they were rude.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:55.160
But it was like as if they hadn't seen people with learning disabilities out in the way that they were out with my mother.
