00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.880
I worked on an elderly ward, so that was about 30 beds of males with dementia.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.040
And that had a Florence, like the Nightingale Ward, so you could see everybody there.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:22.520
And you staff, I worked mainly nights there, so there'd be two staff one night with 30 patients.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.660
It was hard work, but I think, I don't know whether there was use, you know, it was okay.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.860
It was okay.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.740
It was very regimented.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.900
You know, you knew who was doing what at a certain time.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.060
And then we used to have to mop the floors.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.520
And I just remember in this ward, cockroaches.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.660
I remember watching a panorama program a few years later and saying that those were big cockroaches.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.160
They were big cockroaches there.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.800
And, you know, so we used to have to mop the floor.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.960
And if you'd put the light on in certain areas, you could hear them, you know.
