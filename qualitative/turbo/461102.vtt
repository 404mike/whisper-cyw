00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.460
Do you think that television has had an effect on your use of leisure time over the years?

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.060
Oh yes, definitely. Without a doubt.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:11.420
Yes.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.980
We do see we select the viewers,

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.600
because quite often we don't often put the television on until 9 o'clock,

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.720
but television does play a very important part in our lives.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.620
There's no doubt about it.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.640
I think it plays an important part in everybody's lives.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.920
I think anybody who says it doesn't are kidding themselves.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.920
Because Wendy knows I'm an avid news watcher.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.160
I must have this 6 o'clock or 10 o'clock news on.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.080
And when I knock it off, I'm depressed.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.480
And of all the things that you've seen over the years,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.240
what has left the greatest impression on you?

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.980
Oh, it's got to be Mandela.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.580
We had the pleasure last year of going to the British Lines.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.960
And we went up to Robben Island.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.180
The moment we arrived there,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.840
Wend started crying,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.700
and didn't stop crying until we got off,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.040
until we got back on the boat.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.180
And I wasn't far behind.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.720
But that day when he walked free,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.540
oh dear me,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.720
that will be everlasting.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.320
And it's cemented now,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.460
because we've been there,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.260
and we actually went to the cell,

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.140
where he spent all his years.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.400
We've had the background of all that he did,

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.320
the background of all that he stood for,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.660
all the things he refused,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.220
because they couldn't break him.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.040
And when we found out that they offered him this,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.580
that and the other,

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.600
he said,

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.180
no, no, no,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.160
offer it to us all on nothing.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.720
Oh, the character of the man,

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.680
the principle of the man.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.280
And because we've been there as well,

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.240
it's just there now.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.680
Whenever you see that walk now,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.680
oh, boy, oh boy,

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.460
it gets better and better.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.820
But there's another as well,

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.060
I think,

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.740
that had an impact,

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.020
a similar thing,

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.540
great man,

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.300
JFK.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.620
You know,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.680
the time he got shot,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.440
we all know where we were,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.420
I certainly knew where I was.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.280
And that,

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.480
as a teenager,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.680
had a very big effect.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.940
And I couldn't get enough of watching it,

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.480
because I never,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.580
ever subscribed to the theory

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.940
of the assassination.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.980
You know,

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.420
and we'll never know the truth.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.580
I'd love to,

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.280
but we never will.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.740
But that,

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.040
again,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.960
the mystery of surrounding it as well,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.600
has added to it.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.540
But the assassination of Kennedy,

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.920
as a teenager,

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.240
oh,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.820
dear me,

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.340
huge impact,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.020
huge impact.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.980
He's our hero.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.140
You know,

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.660
a young man,

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.800
taking charge of the world,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.600
assassinated,

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.100
and then all the plots,

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.060
and counter plots,

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.080
that came after it,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.860
kept the news going for years,

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.320
and years,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.960
and then theories come out.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.040
So we've never lost it.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.060
Never lost it.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.260
But,

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.420
and two great men.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.540
But I think Mandela more than anything else,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.560
because we've,

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.340
our friend,

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:46.820
actually met him.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.340
And you've got a photograph

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.400
on his wall with Mandela,

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.720
so,

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.060
and the greatness of the man himself.
