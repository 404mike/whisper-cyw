Welcome to Mouth Off, a podcast brought to you by Forget Me Not Productions.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.660
My name is Clary Sadler, and on today's episode, I'm going to be talking about the I Plus Matter

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.360
project, which is a heritage lottery funded project conceived by T. Gwynn Special School

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:26.160
in Cardiff and inclusive arts organization Forget Me Not Productions. I Plus Matter

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.620
provided multiple opportunities for meaningful assistive technology experiences. These were

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.660
interwoven with the arts, and music was used as a motivator to enable individuals with the most

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:48.460
complex physical and cognitive disabilities to share their own history and celebrate their

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:55.840
independent achievements. The project was launched in February 2020 and was due to conclude in July

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.780
of that year. We were going to have a training event called I Plus Matter Festival, and it was

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.820
going to involve professionals in the field of special education and social and health sectors.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.400
It was also going to be a celebration of the achievements of all involved. The participants

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:23.500
would use a range of assistive technology such as eye gaze, switches, and touch monitors in order to

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.260
help them achieve and independently take part in music and arts sessions.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:37.480
Due to COVID-19, the project was postponed and we had to adapt the sharing event and the training

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:44.720
event to fit a virtual platform. Pupils at five local special schools, adults from a local day center,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.840
and three individuals all with complex needs took part in assistive technology and inclusive art

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.760
sessions called Music Can. Music Can is a protocol developed by Forget Me Not production, and it uses music

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:07.240
primarily as a motivator to engage individuals with the most complex needs in assistive technology.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.380
T. Gwynn School were the project lead and other partners included My Sebu Special School, Trinity

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:22.020
Field Special School, Park Lane Special School, Gadliss Day Center, and three private clients that had all

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:30.200
worked with Forget Me Not productions in the past. Most of the face-to-face Music Can sessions had resumed by the end of 2021,

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:38.450
but sadly due to ongoing COVID-19 restrictions, Trinity Field Special School had to pull out.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.990
Luckily, a Skolhenvelin Special School stepped in and had the remaining sessions, enabling us to wrap up the project.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:54.110
So what exactly do we mean by assistive technology? Well, for the purpose of this project, we are using the term

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.490
assistive technology to include any specialist technology that enables access to a computer.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:09.530
So things such as switches, touch monitors, eye gaze, which is a computer that is operated by eye movements,

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.870
and these are linked to specialist software for teaching cause and effect, choice making and beyond,

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.830
augmentative and alternative communication, or AAC, specialist controls for wheelchair driving,

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.190
and access to toys and play.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:33.430
So when eye gaze first became commercially available, it was really mostly suited for

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.590
people who were already at a level of using AAC, and perhaps were using AAC with switches,

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.750
switches being very effective, but slow, slow and laborious.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.470
Another focus of iPlus Matter has been to provide staff members with the opportunities to be trained in

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.790
the implementation of assistive technology systems for those with the most complex disabilities.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.210
Why do you think projects such as this, iPlus Matter, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund,

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.190
are so important for the individuals that have been taking part from your school?

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:15.430
When they see assistive technology, like we did have ideas on case machines here, but they've become old,

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.850
and they've been broken, and they're obsolete. So it's only now that we've started to use the

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.990
ideas because we've all returned to your project and brought them in, and we're using one pair of

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:32.210
different ideas in. So we're trying to re-establish those, and also we want to start training the staff,

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.590
and really to see what opportunities we can use with the ideas. It's wonderful with your project,

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.030
because you can see how well the children have responded to it, and how much you really need that in our school.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.730
What have been the main benefits that you've seen from the individuals that have taken part in the project?

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.630
So to see how much they've progressed in the two weeks has been amazing. I think it's fantastic.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:02.110
When they get to experience technology, and staff get to see what they're capable of by using that

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:08.110
technology, which gives us input as then to move forward with purchasing them ourselves and developing

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:15.510
those skills. And pupils get to be able to be part of a project. Parents can share and see that project,

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.790
and see what the children are working on. And I know the way that our pupils have responded, they've

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:27.030
focused, and they've really enjoyed it. And I think music is such a wonderful access around

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:33.470
pupils anyway. So it's just a wonderful way for them to be focused and to be able to get into that

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:39.670
niche, and they are there. Absolutely. What are the main barriers for these individuals

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:46.170
achieving independently within a school or daycare setting? The challenge is they need more

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:54.430
like consistency, and they need more technology things to come in for the children to help them progress

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:01.790
higher than where they already are. One of the main aims of the project has been to empower individuals

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:08.470
identified as experiencing profound and multiple learning disabilities, or individuals that have

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:16.550
complex physical disabilities. These individuals use assistive technology to experience independent

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:23.030
achievement. And throughout the project, we use the Music Can framework to motivate engagement with this

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:32.410
technology, changing and shifting the focus from disability to ability. When I started making music with

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:39.050
forget-forgetting the not productions, it changed my life. Music transformed me. We hope to raise awareness

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:45.830
also of the historical development of assistive technologies and the potential impact for independent

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:54.070
learning via new technologies and new techniques. We speak to Mel Sadler about the history of assistive technology.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:07:01.850
But of course, by far, the biggest development for assistive technology, particularly for those individuals with the

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:09.050
with the greatest cognitive impairment has been the development of eye gaze. So eye gaze worked really well for that group of

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:17.190
people straight away. But it took some time for eye gaze to be suited for software to come out and be made available

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:25.410
for people with more significant intellectual impairments as well as their physical disability. But once software such as

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:32.130
look to learn and sensory eye effects and some of the inclusive technology softwares became available

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:39.830
for eye gaze users, it's really opened up a whole new world for that group of learners, which is just amazing.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:51.530
And you see people making choices using eye gaze, who I would have considered it being very difficult to teach them to make choices using switches,

00:07:51.530 --> 00:08:01.830
because using switches to make choices is a much higher cognitive load, if that makes sense. Yet, they can do it with eye gaze.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:11.370
We also talked to assistive technology guru Carol Thornette. Dr. Carol Thornette has been involved in the field of

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:18.650
assistive technology since 1986. She was a pioneer in exploring the use of assistive technology with individuals

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:25.690
experiencing profound and multiple learning disabilities. In fact, it was Carol that developed the first mobility platform,

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:33.250
which was originally part of the Spastic Society research project and had the aim of enabling children with cerebral palsy

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.830
to explore mobility when their peers were able to.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:42.710
With mobility, trying to get children mobile at the same age that their peers would be mobile,

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:49.990
since they extrapolated to those with learning difficulties and a physical difficulty obviously as well.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:56.630
But initially, it was just a physical difficulty. That proved to be really exciting.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:06.250
And I think it's quite sad now that I've seen so few with independent mobility. They should be in their usual seating.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:14.950
Because that was always such a problem if they went to a wheelchair service, in that, you know, what seating would they use?

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.990
So this was, you know, that's really the reason why it was a platform.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:30.310
That you could attach the whole seating system so that you started by looking at whether they could control it and what they would do and, you know, if they stopped.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.790
And stopping is as important as going and so on.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:38.990
The historic Criager Park School has also been our heritage partner throughout the iPlusmatter sessions.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.850
Criager Park House is a country house in Pentirk, Cardiff.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:47.790
It was built in 1914 for a colliery owner named Thomas Evans.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:58.610
Evans died in 1943 and Criager Park then came into the possession of the National Coal Board before being sold in 1954 to the Spastic Society.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:06.930
They opened a residential school site in 1955 and the house still operates as a residential care facility today.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:14.470
It is also a special school for young adults with learning disabilities, which is operated by Salutum Healthcare.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.590
The school I work in is catered for people with disabilities.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:24.990
Research the school you're going to work in and the students you're going to work with.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:31.470
And then it's just a case of getting to know your colleagues and them getting to know you.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:37.090
And that should make your job hopefully a lot easier.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:44.470
That was one of the first things people used to look at and say.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:53.250
That I'm probably a student, but that doesn't happen anymore because I'm older and I grow beards and stuff like that.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.670
So that tends not to happen anymore.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:06.570
Well, my powered wheelchair, it can, well the batteries last longer, which means I can stay out for longer.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.950
I can socialise for longer and be in work for longer.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:30.750
So as you can see, the chair, the chair that I'm sitting in is actually rising, which then also helps me in my job professionally when I'm working with students with standing frames,

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:39.590
who aren't in standing frames, sorry, and also helps me socially when there is no seating available for other people.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:44.490
I can then rise myself up to the level that the person is standing to.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:49.030
And then when I'm, when I'm done, you just go back down.

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:53.310
So it's basically far different now to how it used to be.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:12:00.850
Um, there's no comparison because now I can turn lights on using my voice.

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:16.010
Whereas when I was younger, I wasn't able, well, I wasn't able to really, I wasn't able to really reach the light switches due to them being on a different level.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:28.610
So what would you say you're most proud of something you've achieved, maybe through your use of technology that's helped you achieve that thing?

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.510
Could be related to school or it could be...

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:33.970
Games.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:34.750
Games?

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:41.590
And remote control.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:43.270
Controls.

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:50.110
Yes.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:54.110
I need help trying out accessible instruments.

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:59.430
I need help accessing music tech and recording studios.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.670
This is what we're doing through us really, isn't it?

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:03.550
I guess remotely in the house.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:09.310
When I started making music with Forget Me Not Productions, it changed my life.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.530
Music transformed me.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.650
I feel like I'm finally using my brain properly.

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:19.890
Join me next time when I interview Yvonne Kinnicky.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:25.330
Yvonne is a programmer and curator specializing in black independent film.

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:26.730
Music

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.830
Music

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:28.850
Music

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:28.910
Music

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:28.950
Music

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:29.930
Music

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:31.110
Music

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.110


00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.690
Music

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:32.050
Music

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:32.050


00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:32.690
No.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:32.670
