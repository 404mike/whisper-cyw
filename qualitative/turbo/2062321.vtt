Next we come on to the Hunslet which was used underground to all supplies. It was used to take

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.420
men underground. It would be bringing the men out. It would be fitted with a diesel engine.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.700
You couldn't fit a petrol engine. There'd be too much danger in gas. Diesel was totally enclosed

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.540
and was quite safe underground providing the exhaust was long enough unmuffled. To your right

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:34.080
there's a lump of steel that was a steam hammer. This came from Coignant collier to Blindant

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:43.700
in 1968. When it was in commission in Coignant the anvil that you see next to it would have been

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:52.400
actually underneath the hammer and protruding through the oblong hole in the hammer and the hammer would

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.060
have been steam operated. You see the steam engine on the left. This would have worked the hammer up

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.560
and down for shaping large sections of steel.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.560


00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.560


00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.560


00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.560


00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.560


00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.560


00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.560


00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.860
