00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040
At home we had no television in 1953, but I had an uncle who lived in Triallo, which did.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:13.180
So I can remember that we went to Triallo on the day of the coronation to actually try and view it.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.900
Because again, the quality of picture wasn't very clever. It was all in black and white, very crackled.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.560
So I can vaguely remember that.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.440
And remember it because people's opinion were quite different in those days.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.140
And I suppose that a lot of the family were ex-service people.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:42.400
So at the age of four I could sing the sort of national anthem, especially for that particular day, I suppose.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.400
So yeah, I do remember the coronation.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.320
What was the atmosphere like? Do you remember anything of that?

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.320
In addition to being able to see it on television, of course there were street parties.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.600
There were street parties and there was lots of decorations.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.700
And different streets did different things.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.860
I remember on the Seat Road where I lived, of course we couldn't decorate them.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.640
It was the main road.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.120
But on the side streets there, Whitten Street in particular, was highly decorated.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.540
And they put on this magnificent play of theirs.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.620
And they used the Catholic Church Hall in the Seat to do it.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.480
And it was funny to see people of all ages taking part.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.560
Everybody got involved.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.440
A really truly sort of local community spirit in those days.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.320
Truly different to what it is nowadays.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.960
faced...

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.320
...

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.660
And we would interrupt as a truck city Mmm dlatego watch a destination,

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.660


00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.660


00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.660


00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.660


00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.660


00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.660


00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.660


00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.660


00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.660


00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.660


00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.640
