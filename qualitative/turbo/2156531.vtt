WEBVTT

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:22.980
Yes, we're ready to go now. Today is Friday the 23rd of September. My name is Jill Willey and I'm at Habit Hardware talking to Mr. John Jones, who has lived in this area all his life.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:31.420
John, thank you very much for agreeing to have a chat with me. First of all, could we just start with your year of birth, John, please?

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.840
I was born on the 2nd of February, 1948.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.980
And can you tell me where you were born?

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.060
I was born in a bedroom up a Llanfadog.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.980
Llanfadog. Can you tell me exactly where Llanfadog is then, John?

00:00:49.980 --> 00:01:01.260
Well, as you go from Rader up the Llanfadog, you go past the Llanfadog Hotel and it's the next farm on your right, about 300 yards away.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:13.480
Thank you. And what sort of facilities do you remember as you were growing up? Things like running water and etc. Can you give me some details of that sort of thing?

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:25.880
Well, we had no electricity. The toilet was outside, about 50 yards away. And the water we had from the spout.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:42.360
And my mother did all the washing and that out there by the brook. And bathing was a tin bath brought into the back kitchen, perhaps twice a week, sometimes only once a week.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:55.020
And no electricity. So we had these paraffin lamps that you had to pump up all the time when the pressure dropped.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:04.160
I see. And how much work did you yourself do around the farm, John, as a young boy growing up?

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:18.980
I did quite a bit. When I attended Llanfadog Village School, I used to milk a cow every morning by hand because we sold milk around the Llanfadog Village.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:30.300
And that was my contribution. I milked this one cow, perched on a little stool, and then I walked to the school afterwards.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.560
And you actually got your water from where exactly, John?

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:48.840
Well, between the house and building at Llanfadog, there was a brook coming down. And we had a spout and a little pool there. And that is where the water came from.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:03:06.120
But when I was about 10, we had it piped about 500 yards from another well out in the field. And that was wonderful spring water. And the only time I saw that go dry was in the hot summer of 1976.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:15.560
Indeed. And were your family born at and grew up in Llanfadog Upper?

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.740
My father was born there. My father was born there. And my mother was born at the Gunvind Llanfadog.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.460
Now, were you a large family, John, in Van Baderog?

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:47.860
Yes, we were. I was the fourth. But there was a baby loss between me and the sister above me. So we were five, really. And so there was five of us. But I was born a long time after.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:04:02.660
My two older sisters was 22 and 20 when I was born. And two up to my three sisters were married with children. So I have nephews and nieces older than myself.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.900
That's quite unusual. But of course, it does happen.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:15.380
What sort of major events can you remember in the Llanfadog as you were growing up, John?

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:36.000
Well, I suppose the first one was when the Queen came with the Duke of Edinburgh in October 1952. I would have been four years old. And I just remember standing outside the hotel over on where the bicycle path is now with our flags.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.720
And my sister, Joan, was a waitress in the Ellen Valley and she waited on the Queen.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:54.600
Oh, what an accolade, my word. And what places did you have to play in and to generally just explore in your Ellen Valley area?

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:05.640
On a farm. You had plenty of places. You had fields all around you. But I think me and my nephews enjoyed going down the brook to where it meets the River Ellen.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:14.640
And we were catching minnows there until I was old enough to have a rod and line. And I loved fishing in those days.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:26.400
Quite a lot of that goes on at the Ellen Valley, doesn't it? Right. Now, what memories do you have of the big shearings that took place in the Ellen Valley, John?

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:39.800
Oh, well, it was the highlight of the year. Like you swapped men with neighbouring farms. So, you know, there might be 30 men would come to your shearings.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:52.060
And it was the day of the year. And you started off with breakfast and then you had lunch and tea and hopefully you finished about five o'clock.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:06:05.120
And we had one hill which was up above the Clurwyn Dam. So, them sheep had to be driven down on a two-day drive sort of thing to share at Upperland-Vadag.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:13.060
And then that night they were taken back up to the Hen Run and they went on from there back to their hill next day.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:23.680
And sharing was a wonderful thing. As a boy, the highlight was after dinner, we'd have a game of football with all the younger men.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:38.520
But what I remember, there was four or five old men sat outside the barn on a bench all day and all they were sitting down and talking about tales.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:45.660
And they seemed very old to me. But when I think back, they were probably only in their late 60s, you know.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.720
But the way they dressed and that, I thought they were a hundred.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.140
But I'm sure they had lots of interesting memories to share.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:03.760
Yes. So, would you say that despite the rural locality, you had plenty to do and a very good social life, you knew everyone?

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.260
Oh, yes. I knew everyone.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:20.420
And as I'd got two nephews living behind the Ellen Valley Hotel, the three of us sort of played together most nights and played football in the field at Len Badog.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:29.940
And later on, when Birmingham City Police Cadets came to Ellen Village, they had goalposts put up on the green.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.680
So, we used to go up there to play football.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:38.760
And I've seen a cycle down to Lanworthville to play boys of Lanworthville.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.960
And everywhere we went, we cycled.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:49.160
And I was a founder member of Rader Young Farmers.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.560
And that started in 1963.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:57.180
And till we were old enough to drive, we went there on a pushbike.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.060
Which was up in Brintirion then, they held the meetings.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:08.760
And Brintirion, I understand, is the then secondary school of the area.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.620
Yes, it was.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:16.300
The only time I ever attended Brintirion was to try my 11+.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.560
Right. We'll come on to that now then, on to school life.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:29.520
Can you tell me where you went to school and what age you were when you started, John?

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:35.740
I went to Ellen Village Primary School at East...

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:36.920
1953.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.120
My birthday was February, so I had just gone five.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.220
And my sister Joan took me to school the first morning.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:55.260
And all the other pupils were stood in the entrance, I think waiting the newcomer.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.940
And I was there till 1959.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:05.280
And I had many a happy time looking back in the Valley School.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.640
We were never more than 20 pupils.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.700
And I think when I left, they were down to 12.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.420
And there was two teachers there.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.840
The first teacher was Mrs. Jim Price or Mrs. Betty Price.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.600
And the senior teacher was Miss Chew.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.640
I have heard those names.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.600
Right.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.520
Could I add one more thing?

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:32.920
Please.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:38.180
The only thing I hated about the Ellen Valley School,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:44.140
every June, the Lord Mayor of Birmingham came down and we had the June tea.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.720
And of course the tea was nice.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:47.860
I loved that.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.940
But afterwards we had to perform on stage.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.420
And every year they seemed to have me to sing a solo.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:01.960
And after that the Lady Mayoress presented us all with a book for what we'd done during the year.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.300
If you've done well, you had the best books.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:07.940
Right.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:15.340
And am I right in thinking that the school at the Ellen Village was where the lodge is now?

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.340
Yes, it was.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:24.720
There was a school immediately above it when the works were going on.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.320
But this new school was built in 1909.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.260
And my mother went to the old school just above it.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:42.360
But my father was not allowed to go to that school because he was living in the Radnorshire side.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.400
And he had to walk three miles to come to the school every day.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:56.160
So you yourself went to the Ellen Village School but you were still in what was then Radnorshire, weren't you?

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:02.120
So were there many other children from Radnorshire in that school?

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.480
No.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:03.820
No.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.260
I think at the time I left there was just two of us.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.520
The other boy didn't try the 11 plus.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.240
So he went straight to Brinturian.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.900
There was three the same age as me living on the Breckenshire side.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.660
So they went to Bilf High School.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.540
And they didn't have to try the 11 plus.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.280
I was the only one out of the five of us that had to try the 11 plus.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:37.360
And was that because Radnorshire and Breckenshire being different authorities had decided different rules regarding the 11 plus?

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.200
Yes it had.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.260
I mean it's different now.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.680
You can go to any school.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.140
But in them days it was Radnorshire and Breckenshire.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.980
And I only lived 200 yards from the River Ellen.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.940
And if I'd been the other side of it I'd have been in Breckenshire.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.380
And would not have had to take the 11 plus.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:57.980
I see.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.320
Now having taken the 11 plus what school did you then go to John?

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:07.440
I went to Landrinder Grammar School in the first week of September 1959.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:16.940
When a school car driven by Mr Harold Ashton from the shop down opposite Jimmy Lloyd's yard.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:24.800
And then we met the bus up by the Smithfield in Rader.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.100
And there was a boys bus and a girls bus.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.640
And how long were you at that school travelling to and from then John?

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:44.260
Well I left in 1963 because I'd had a couple of run-ins with Mr Howell's headmaster.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:49.120
And he said that I had to try my O-levels and I said I'll show you.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.280
And I left.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.740
You left.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:55.560
Right.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:01.840
John you must have seen quite a lot of changes in the valley.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:07.160
Would you like to talk a little bit about the development of the valley as you know it?

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.320
Well I've seen lots of changes.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.500
Not for the better in my opinion.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.860
I, you know, although I'm a proud Welshman,

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.960
Birmingham were very good landlords.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.960
And they were good to the farmers.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:28.400
And they would provide new gates and hurdles and fencing material every year.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:34.940
And then when it changed over to Welsh water it was a downward spiral.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:41.740
And I think the valley was much better in those days.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.100
Much tidier.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.480
You could fish from the Cabin Dam to Garrick D.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:51.540
That railway line had two or three sheep in it and it kept all the foliage down.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:57.100
Now it's just like a jungle and you can't fish one yard of it.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:05.040
Very, very unfortunate because fishing is really quite a prominent activity in our area, isn't it?

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:06.260
Yes.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.880
Speaking about the livestock now,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.320
how often did you actually come into Raida to the market or to any other market?

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.120
Well I don't remember coming much.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:24.760
My father, you know, would bring a cow or cow and cab or something occasionally to the mart.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:29.240
And we'd always sell our sale ewes in the autumn.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.520
And we drove them down with two dogs.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:38.280
And I sometimes walked in front and my father behind.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.020
And we never lost one.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:45.280
We always got them to the market and tied the dogs up there all day.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.300
And sold.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:52.600
And one year the prices were poor.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.140
So we didn't sell.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.320
I was about 16 at the time.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.200
Anyway, my father was getting on then.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.260
And a car stopped when we were driving these sheep home.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.280
And he offered father a lift home.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.680
And he said, I'll leave my dog with you.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:15.700
And soon as father got in the car, the dog went back towards Raida.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:19.020
And unfortunately he got killed by a car.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.140
And I got the sheep home with my dog.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:29.560
And then my sister Joan went back to Raida in the van to look for this dog.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.360
And found him dead on the road and brought him back.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.340
That was a sad day.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.940
How unfortunate one that I'm sure.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.800
And we took the sheep to the next fair and didn't do any better.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.640
So we may as well have sold them on the first fair.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.600
All memories of course, Joan, aren't they?

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:49.000
Yes.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.720
Now if we could come back to the school.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.280
I believe you had some relatives that actually taught at that school, John.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:59.660
Can you tell us a little bit about that, please?

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.480
Well, they didn't teach at that school.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:07.800
They taught at the old school up the cabin which is now under the water.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.780
I think they moved here in 1891.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:20.080
Elizabeth Abley and her sister Alice Ann Abley, who became my grandmother.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.760
She married Evan Jones from Upperland Paddock.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:31.960
And they were brought here to teach English because they knew that the dams was coming.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:37.600
And there was a lot of English and Irish and Scots people moving into the area.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:42.540
So that was the end of the Welsh language in the Ellen Valley School.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:51.880
The demise of the Welsh language in the valley is something I'd like to touch on now.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:58.700
Prior to that, your family would have been Welsh speakers, presumably, your ancestors.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.220
Yes.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:07.660
Do you actually remember any of your family, older relatives, actually speaking Welsh as their day-to-day language?

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:17.680
Well, my father could speak Welsh quite good, but as he had an English mother, there was English spoke at home, you know.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.500
But his father was fluent Welsh.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:27.580
And then on my mother's side, the family, they were all fluent Welsh.

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:32.580
But, you know, they had died before I was sort of born.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:53.420
And my grandfather and grandmother from the clean, they were more English than Welsh because they were both, well, one was brought up at the Gunford and the other was brought up at the Dunford Newbridge on White.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.400
I see.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:24.840
Yes.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:25.140
Yes.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:30.660
When I went to London, I had the choice to either learn Welsh or French.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:36.900
And I was taught Welsh with a teacher called Annie Griffiths.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.200
Right.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:49.960
So, sadly, well, there's a real resurgence now in learning Welsh, of course, but it's, you know, it's a little sad.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:55.900
Yeah, my two grandchildren now, Arthur and Marnie, are both in the Welsh unit.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.340
That's a very good idea. That's here in Rhaedra, is it?

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.660
Yes, in Rhaedra, in Tyrion.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.340
Oh, right.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:10.420
Which I'm very pleased about, because I am very Welsh, you know, in my thoughts.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.320
Very commendable, John, I'm sure.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.460
John, could we touch on pony trekking?

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:21.580
I understand you had quite an involvement in that in your younger days.

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:27.520
Yes, I was on the pony trekking committee for many years.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.800
They were called Rhaedra Pony Trekking Association.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.380
And Mr. David Evans was the secretary.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:40.200
And people like Kinsey Morgan and Gerald Morgan were chairman and vice chairman.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:49.360
And I was always interested in it, probably because every year a lot of pretty girls came along.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.180
And I met one called Gina Day.

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:59.200
And after an on and off romance for four years, I married her.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.820
And she is now still called Gina Jones.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.300
But unfortunately, we got divorced.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.060
But the trekking was a wonderful thing.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:14.600
And I've seen up to 100 ponies going out on a day, you know.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.440
A terrific line of trekkers.

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:23.000
And they came from all over the, well, all over Europe, actually.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:28.340
But in the end, I was guide for two years.

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.300
And it was a much harder job then.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:35.980
Because instead of having a trekker for a week who would pick up things,

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.940
you had day trekkers.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.740
And half of them couldn't ride.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.000
And you couldn't go any faster than the slowest rider.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.220
Or the poorest rider.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.360
And some of you had to lead, you know.

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:53.740
But I always found out that if anybody arrived on a motorbike,

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.160
they could ride.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.320
The balance was right.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.240
I've never seen a poor rider off a motorbike.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.640
Using the same muscles, I wouldn't doubt.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:06.960
Fine.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.580
Now, John, you've spoken about riding your bike a lot.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.680
For recreation, etc.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:19.500
Did you use horses as a means of transport for getting around generally at all?

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.300
Oh, yes.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.960
My father was always on horseback.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:26.620
He used to do all the gathering of sheep on horseback.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.900
And I rode a horse a lot.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.480
Like, I was probably riding a three-year-old.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:36.740
I think I started off on the donkey in Aberystwyth.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:39.040
But I've got a photo of me on that.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:46.760
And we had a hill above the Clirwyn Dam called Crothia.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:57.260
So, when we wanted to gather that, we would ride up to the Henfren and then go over the top of the hill and drop down on Clirwyn.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:11.600
And then drive them down to Llanfadog on horseback.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:26.100
And then drive them down to Llanfadog on horseback.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.360
And then drive them down to Llanfadog on horseback.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:31.100
Things have certainly changed, haven't they, in the transport department?

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:32.200
Yes.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:39.140
And, John, I understand you've worked very hard and long on compiling your family tree.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:45.340
And am I right in thinking that it takes you right back to the Lewis Lloyds, the original landowners?

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:46.180
Yes.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.820
Well, me and my son Tom have done a lot of work on it.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.620
And I've had help of other people.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:58.400
But being as they were sort of landed gentry, it was quite easy to trace them.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:07.600
But Tom has gone back, I think it's 700 years, to the Powells from Lanarkow who married into the Lewis Lloyds.

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:12.320
And I've got it down to this present day, which I'm very proud of.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:21.620
And now when the dams are very low, the walls of Nankwilt have all come in sight of the gardens, you know.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:27.480
And that's where I think, you know, that it all started for me in the Ellon Valley.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:33.540
Well, it's wonderful to see these houses suddenly arising out of the water, isn't it?

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.040
It makes you want to do that.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.260
You mentioned the Llanarkow.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:44.380
That was Nankwilt, I believe, where the Lewis Lloyds lived.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.500
Were they actually in the Ellon Valley or were they in the Clydwin Valley?

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:55.520
Well, it's actually on the banks of the Clirwin River, isn't it?

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.180
The Nankwilt estate.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:05.900
But, I mean, they own so much of it right up to Clirwin Farm, which, you know, is miles above the Clirwin Dam.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:18.660
And one of my ancestors, Peter Jones from Aberguesson, who already was a huge landowner over there and had thousands of sheep,

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:24.960
he married into the Lewis Lloyds and the rest is history, as they say.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:29.860
And how long have you been working on this family tree then, you and your son?

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:34.700
Oh, you're never finished.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.280
You know, there's something comes up new all the time.

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:42.940
I found a cousin in London the other day, Sanders.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.160
Her name is Miss Sanders.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:51.160
And there's a lot of them out in Perth and Patagonia.

00:24:51.900 --> 00:25:00.440
And mother's great-uncle, David Jones, had a farm out in Buenos Aires.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.820
And the name of the farm was Alvira.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:08.680
And my mother named my oldest sister Alvira Mary.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.720
How nice.

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:12.500
Right.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:14.660
You have grandchildren now, John.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.440
Are they enjoying being at the valley and enjoying the places where you grew up?

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:24.980
Yes, because I've still got some ground belonging to Apple and Laddook.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.300
And they love it up there.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:33.300
Arthur went up the other day to burn a bit of cardboard or something and he thinks it's wonderful.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:38.560
And Marnie's up there every night with her father running a dog round.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.680
And I think it's nice to get out of town.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:50.800
Well, what better place, indeed, than the beautiful Ellen Valley.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.840
Well, John, it's been absolutely fascinating talking to you.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.480
We could go on all day, really, thinking about things.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:03.720
So thank you very, very much for your input, your time and all your fascinating information.

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:09.480
Thank you very much for you asking me these questions.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.120
You're welcome.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:11.120
