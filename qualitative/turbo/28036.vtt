00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
Audio Point 2

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.880
From here, you're able to sit and enjoy the view from the bench.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:16.380
Straight ahead and slightly to the right, perched on top of a smaller hill, is the hillfort of Moelagair, Llanbedr.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:25.400
Samantha Williams is the Hillfort Conservation Officer for the Heather and Hillforts project, and is involved in the work on Moelagair.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.580
She talks about what it may have been used for.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.800
From here, you can see Moelagair, Llanbedr.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.660
Hillforts possibly have many functions.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.080
They are defended in closures, so they are something that is defensive.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.160
They have massive banks and ditches, which are called ramparts, and they would have had a wooden fence on top called a palisade.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:56.000
So that does suggest that their aim was to keep people out, so possibly places that they retreated to in times of trouble and conflict.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.400
But it could also be that they were sort of farming centres on top of the hill, a bit like a Havod site in the medieval times.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.040
So you turn your flocks out onto the hill during the summer.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:18.340
So there could be centres where those people collected their flocks when they needed to sort of do shearing or something.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.100
And today, our greatest predator is a fox.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.080
But in those days, they had things like brown bears and wolves.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.620
And we forget that they were massive creatures.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.000
So it could be to protect your stock from those animals as well.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.120
And also, hillforts are on top of great massive hills, and they are really obvious features within the landscape.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.260
So there could be centres that people could gather to, to maybe celebrate births, deaths and marriages.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.860
Or for trading centres, where they could trade goods with other Celtic settlements around in the area.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.160
So they could have many, many functions.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.400
We just don't know.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.760
Next, hear about the Bronze Age from Fiona Gale, Denbyshire County Archaeologist.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.880
As you're sitting on the bench, looking out towards the Vale of Cluid and admiring the view,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.160
just look slightly to your right and you'll see this heap of stones.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.700
Higgledy-piggledy heat doesn't look as if it's got much shape to it.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.640
But actually, that's the remains of a Bronze Age cairn.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.380
Presumably, originally, it either had more stone there or was covered up with tubs.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.220
Earth and earth.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.120
And somehow, that's become eroded.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.220
Possibly, in the middle of there, we've got a burial from 2000 BC, 4000 years ago.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.540
Maybe even some later cremations added into the mound.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:53.160
Difficult to imagine now from that heap of stones, but we've got to picture maybe a group of people coming up to bury their mother, father or whatever.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.020
And feeling much as we would at a funeral too.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.660
So we've got to try and put ourselves back in the shoes, if they wore shoes, of people in the Bronze Age.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:11.540
When you're ready, follow the path onwards until you reach Audio Point 3 on a wooden way marker opposite another bench.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.980
On your way, you will catch your first glimpse of the Jubilee Tower in the distance.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.980
For additional information on hillforts from Samantha Williams, continue listening, otherwise hang up now.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.300
The features of a hillforts are that they have ramparts, which are big banks and ditches.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.820
Some hillforts even have more than one.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.060
They also have interned entrances.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.260
So the banks turn into the entrance, which would have been protected by a massive gate.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.200
So that made them quite a defensive structure again.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.540
On top of the ramparts, we would have had a palisade, which is a big wooden fence.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.380
And there would have been roundhouses within the hillforts as well.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:08.740
A roundhouse is a circular structure that's made of timber, which would have had a thatched roof, which would have gone pretty much to the floor to keep the walls dry.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.360
And the walls would have been made up of wattle and daub, which is hazel or willow that's weaved through stakes.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.880
And then covered in daub, which is a mixture of clay, animal dung and straw.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.580
And inside the roundhouse, there would have been a central hearth.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.200
So a fireplace in the middle to keep everybody warm.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.300
And that fire would have gone up into the thatch.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.260
And that would have killed any bugs that was in the thatched roof and kept it nice and snug and warm inside.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.360
And they could have also had meats and things hanging from the ceiling.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.240
So it would have smoked the meat and kept it for the winter months.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.980
So it would have been a nice, cosy structure inside the hillfort nestled in.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.760
And could have been used possibly in times of retreat if the hillfort was a defensive structure.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.560
Or maybe during the summer months, they might have lived up there in the summer months.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.000
The roundhouse comes in different sizes.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.520
So there might have even been different functions for roundhouses.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.380
Maybe somewhere like your garden shed is today.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.340
There is evidence for grain stores as well.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.660
At Moolagaia Rezesmoor, which is just off the Cluidian range outside our project area.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.200
They did a big excavation there and they found four post holes and a square in the ground.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.960
And it's believed that these are grain stores.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:34.080
A square structure raised off the ground that they would have put grain in to keep it and store it over the winter months as well.
