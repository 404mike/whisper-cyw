00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.900
I suppose I watched, I think when I was in the sixth form, we did watch television in the evening a little bit more

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.160
because I didn't have the, I didn't do the amount of subjects then.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.960
Things eased off in the sixth form.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:23.080
But my viewing pattern, I think, well, see, I've been moved about a bit.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.500
Now, when I went to college, we did have a television in the common room, but we didn't watch much television there.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.840
I don't remember much about television in college.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:40.980
And then when I went to work in Liverpool, we did hire a television set, you know, on what do you call it?

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.760
What do you call it? On a higher purchase.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.400
A DER it was.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.240
And do you know, there were four of us in the first year working there.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:01.980
And this girl, no, when we went to the shop, the man said to us, you know, we asked him about it.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:08.060
And then when he realised we wanted to have a television, he wouldn't sell it.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.500
He wouldn't let us have it.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.440
And I said, why?

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.300
He said, you're too young.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.500
I said, we're teachers.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.540
And he didn't believe me.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.140
They wouldn't sell us.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.560
And do you know, I also had somebody who wouldn't sell me the news of the world either.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.540
They said, you're too young.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.880
This woman had, the papers weren't on the counter, they were at the back.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.960
And this old lady wouldn't let me have the news of the world.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.640
We must have looked young.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.520
We must have done.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.220
Oh, dear me.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.680
I wish that happened now.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:48.220
Anyway, the thing was, so yes, we had this, we eventually, we did have a television from another shop, DR it was.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.820
But I don't know that we watched a lot of television.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.920
I don't recall watching programmes much on it, except the news maybe.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.980
I remember on one occasion, there was something about the pill, which was quite controversial at the time.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.880
I don't remember watching anything much.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.320
I can't remember a programme.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.860
Oh, Coronation Street, because my friend was, oh, she's been faithfully watching Coronation Street for years.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.780
And so we did watch that.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.340
But I suppose we went out more in those days.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.220
When you're younger, you go out more, don't you?

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.340
And I was very much in with a Welsh group in Liverpool then.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:36.160
And then I went to London and we had, we didn't have a television there.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.060
But I was only there a term anyway.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.140
And then I came back to the Wirral.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.220
And yes, I did have a television, but not immediately.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.720
I did go out more in the beginning.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.960
But then I had my own flat and I had a television there.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.460
Which was black and white.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.760
Most people had black and white then.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.340
And I think I watched Coronation Street.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.100
I've always liked Coronation Street.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.660
Don't watch any other soap.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.060
And the news as well.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.880
So I've always been clued up to the news really.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.760
And I used to watch the golf and a horror film on a Monday night.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.680
Not that I like horror films now.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.220
And sports.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.240
I love sports.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.580
I like watching rugby.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.700
I like watching Formula One.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.600
And tennis.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.280
I watched tennis there.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.580
And we used to discuss the games at school as well.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.740
Because in those days, Wimbledon started about two o'clock, was it?

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.040
Yes.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.220
So we finished work at three o'clock.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.080
So we used to be rushing home at that time.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.800
Because things were easing off then with summertime.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.040
It was nearly holiday time, wasn't it?

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.640
And so to watch the matches.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.540
It was at the time when Chris Evert was in a heyday and people like that.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.640
And, wait a minute.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.560
Yes, I remember watching those.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.240
I think, I suppose, really, I watched more television when I had my own flat.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.040
I know at home, my father used to like wrestling on a Saturday afternoon, which I didn't.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.720
So I didn't watch that.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:33.780
But, yeah, I think, I suppose, I was more aware of television in the 60s, 60s, 70s.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.040
And I've always been a selective viewer.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.600
But I do like certain things, you know.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:56.240
And I like, I love historical drama, you know, like, oh, and things like Silk.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.720
And another one I loved, well, this was, I was still at school then.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.820
They used to have a programme called No Hiding Place.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.240
It was a detective thing.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.960
But it was lovely, lovely programme on a Sunday night, I think it was.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.700
I think it was a Sunday night.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.580
And they had quite nice music to introduce it as well.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.760
Yeah.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.740
And then in later years, I watched Van der Valk.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.920
Do you remember that?

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.580
I'm probably talking about things you don't know about.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.760
Van der Valk, that was another television programme based in Holland.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.140
And that was a very iconic music.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.240
Have you ever heard of that?

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:34.860
Yes, that's it.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.960
And, oh.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.820
Yes, there have been some, I love documentaries if they're, you know, if they interest me.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.520
And, of course, in later, well, I'm sorry now that Learning Zone is on in the middle of the night.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.100
Although I'm late, you know, I'm late up and it's too late, it's four o'clock or something.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.200
But they used to be, it used to be on about midnight at one time.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.360
And I used to love watching some of that because it's quite educational.
