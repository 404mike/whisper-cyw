Community House was run by the Christian Church to start with. It isn't any longer, but it was.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:14.180
And so the boys in the Asian Youth Club were coming into a Christian environment.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.840
Now, was this a problem? Was it seen as a problem by the boys or by you?

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:27.320
I think, I mean, I'm not looking to be boastful here, but I think Eton Road and Community House at the time were quite lucky

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.740
that they were working with people who were, had a legitimacy in the community.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.560
They were people who were respected in their communities. People like Monis Moflahi, myself.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:46.340
We had a lot to do with the local mosque in Harrow Road. Monis had a lot to do with the mosque in Alexander Road in Pell.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:54.240
We had a young lad from Llanwern Street, one of the local Pakistani lads who was very well respected, a very good footballer.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:02.000
And a Bangladeshi lad. So we had a range of people from different areas, different skills, different knowledge,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.800
and who could relate to the young people. So we almost acted as a bridge between Community House

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:18.280
and, in inverted commas, the church in the background, and the wider Muslim community in the area.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:27.860
I think we looked at the building and we saw, we realised there was a church element to the building,

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:37.360
but we always saw it, we always saw the community part of the building as the greater part of the building.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.560
Now, I don't know why we did that. There was nobody ever said to us, well, this is a community centre more than it's a church.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.360
But for some reason, we just kind of imagined it so, and we were happy to, you know, to go along with that.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.100
But I think more important than the building and the church was the people who were coming to the building,

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.000
the young people. We as workers, people like Brian, other people who were involved with the building.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:15.120
And it was the people who kind of acted as, you know, the bridge and made contact with other people and spoke to other people.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.640
So I think the role of the building was secondary.
