00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
The two devolution campaigns, the first in 79, the second in 97,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.600
did you follow those debates on television?

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.460
I followed them as best I could.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.040
But, to be quite honest, I had very little interest in the first one.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.000
I didn't think we were ready for it, and so it turned out.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.380
It was an almighty defeat.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.480
I think the majority of the Welsh people felt like I did,

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.820
that perhaps the time wasn't ripe.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.220
And it was in 1979, wasn't it?

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.720
Callaghan's government.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.020
Well, he was ready to go anyway.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.920
Everybody knew that.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.620
So I thought, I think there was a bit of a backlash in that,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.500
with unemployment being quite high,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.560
and his government likely to be kicked out if they hadn't already been.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.340
I can't remember what month of the year it was.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.200
When was it?

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.940
It was March, wasn't it?

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.240
Well, he was definitely in power then, wasn't it?

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.820
Because the election wasn't until later with Margaret Thatcher.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.300
And I think it was a backlash.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.940
Because his government had sort of pushed the idea,

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.500
or presented the idea, offered it,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.480
most Welsh people decided, no, we're not doing it.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.880
But of course, when it came to 97,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.040
there were different propositions altogether by then.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.160
Because in the meantime, television had played their part in a big way.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.740
There'd been a...

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.980
Margaret Thatcher had...

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.840
United Wales, in a sense.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.500
For the wrong reasons, perhaps.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.900
But United did nevertheless.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.220
And therefore, there was a growing feeling that perhaps Wales would be better off on their own.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.900
Without the...

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.000
I mean, we've had to suffer the English for the last 800 years, haven't we?

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.920
So...

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.440
And I like what it's...

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.840
If they get a no vote today, it'll carry on for a few...

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.800
much longer, you know.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.380
Are you being able to get home and vote, or what?

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.820
Yes.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.220
You are?

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.540
Yeah.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.200
Oh, it's up until 10, isn't it?

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.440
Oh, it's up until 10, yeah.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.060
That's right.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.600
Yeah, you've got to go down later.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.120
No, I think the...

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.580
And I mean, in 97, they only just scraped through, didn't they?

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.160
50% to...

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.300
50% point...

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.840
50 point something, to 49 point something.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.720
And it's strange, really, because Wales has always been a radical country.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.260
A country of radicals, if you like.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.040
Chartist movement, and Quakers, non-conformists, Wesleyans, Methodists, and so forth.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.880
I mean, I'm Annie Bunwer.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.740
My father was a Wesleyan Methodist.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.740
My mother was a Baptist.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.840
Lots of my friends were Quakers.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.540
I mean, America's built on Quakerism, a lot of it.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.360
It started off...

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.940
The Mormons were in the same type, from the same ilk.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.380
A lot of Welsh people were Mormons.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.120
So I think we were ready for some change, and I think...

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.980
I can't see that the Welsh Assembly has done any harm to be quite nice, and a lot of good.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.640
I see Scotland are following Wales now with free prescriptions.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.600
So they must have done something right.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.000
There's always the feeling...

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.080
Amongst the Welsh, amongst the working class, that MPs who've never done a decent day's work in their lives...

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.880
I'm quoting other people now...

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.040
Are all for what they can get out of it themselves.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.240
Well, that's unfortunate.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.340
But it's because of the MP expenses, which TV highlighted, as well as the newspapers...

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.420
That has caused people to be angry about things.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:55.580
So, as soon as people nowadays, like the Welsh Assembly ministers, put forward an idea...

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.920
Welsh in particular, they're like, aye, aye, what's he saying that for?

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.960
What are they going to get out of it, you see?

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.840
And that's why people are worried, like my wife.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.740
What's it going to cost us if they get a yes vote, you know?

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:19.420
But at the same time, is it right that what we want to do in Wales should be governed by people in England?

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.720
What was...

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.200
Oh yeah, True Wedding.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.040
Because I can remember True Wedding and Capil Kelly getting drowned.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:41.080
And at the time, it was evident that all 40-odd Welsh MPs had voted against it.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.640
And they were outvoted by their English counterparts because they were in the majority.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.640
I mean, what sort of a democracy was that sort of thing, you know?

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.720
When Liverpool could have got their water from the Cumbria, the wettest part of the United Kingdom,

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.960
apart from Wales.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:09.880
And the irony of it was that once they'd flooded Capil Kelly to create True Wedding,

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.940
there were houses overlooking the reservoir who couldn't get water

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.520
because Liverpool wouldn't give supply pipe water to them.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.440
And oh my God, you know.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.480
If we could cast ourselves adrift and float away like Ireland,

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.820
have a river between us or a water between us, we'd be better off, I think.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.980
Yeah.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.980


00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.980


00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.980


00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:30.000
...

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.000


00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.000


00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.000
ETA

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.980
