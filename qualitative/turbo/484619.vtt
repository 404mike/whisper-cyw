00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:09.980
Interview number three, interviewer Steve Fletcher, Artistic Director of Swicker Carnival, interviewee Rob Davey.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.780
Rob, could you spell your name for us please?

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.720
Yes, Rob is R-O-B and Davey is D-A-V-E-Y.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:22.740
Thank you very much. So please, can you tell us how did you first get involved with the Cardiff Mass Carnival?

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:32.400
Yes, I remember it well actually. 1992, my wife Alva got herself involved in the Carnival, which I think was held at Fitzallan that year.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:48.420
And my recollection of that year is that I was working most of the time, but came down on odd occasions during the evening to have a look and see exactly what my wife had got herself and our children involved in.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:58.020
And thought it probably wasn't really for me. It seemed to be a lot of sewing and chatting and a huge amount of material going on there.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.880
And it didn't seem to be something that I really wanted to get myself involved in.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:13.760
However, I certainly watched that carnival and then the next year I decided that if I had any chance of actually seeing my wife and children for three weeks that summer,

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.260
and probably the forthcoming summers, I probably had to get involved myself.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:28.620
And that's really what I did. And I think that year I messed about with some face paints, did a bit of stewarding and generally caught the bug.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:38.360
And then the following year, which is 1994, the blues year, as I recall, there was a lot of blue paint going around,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.980
which left an indelible stain on our bath, at least for many, many weeks.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.980
I did actually get myself into a costume, something that I would never have thought I would ever have done.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.540
And we never looked back for the next sort of eight, nine years, I think. Got myself into costume every year.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.660
Messed about, sang a lot of songs, chanted a lot of chants and generally had a good time.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.080
Is there one costume in particular that's a standout costume for you out of the many that you played over the years?

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.360
Yeah, I think so. I think it's pretty obvious. I think it generally agreed amongst the family is probably the player of games,

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.720
which was, I don't know when that was, mid to late 90s probably.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.920
I don't know whose idea it was, but I know my wife made the costume.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.380
And I remember standing on the steps of the museum wearing this darn costume.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.300
And it was a pretty, pretty smart costume, actually. I enjoyed wearing that one.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.180
Yeah.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:51.600
In terms of the value of Carnival and its impact, if you had to describe some of the benefits that perhaps you've seen personally

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.500
or amongst your family or as a long time, you know, 10 years of Carnival involvement, you'll have seen a lot.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.080
Yeah. How does it affect people?

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.900
Well, I think from this perspective, which is some time after, we've not done it for a number of years now

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.960
because we moved away from Cardiff, so we've not been able to really.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:17.060
I think it's fair to say that it's definitely changed and enhanced our lives.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.260
But I think more than that, I think it's actually informed our kids' lives

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.960
because they started doing Carnival when they were quite young.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.800
I don't know, about 9 and 11, something like that.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.320
And I don't know if there's any question that, as far as they're concerned,

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.580
their lives have been changed because of it.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.180
For instance, my son, Guy, went into theatre, where he remains.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.900
And I think that was certainly helped by being involved in Maz.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.620
And Tasha, my daughter, went to Africa, went to Senegal and married a Senegalese man.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:58.760
And I think the fact that we lived on the face of it, a suburban middle class life in Cardiff,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.540
would have meant it would have been quite difficult for us to have been involved in

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.680
and with the sort of people that Maz brought us into contact with.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:16.420
And whilst I think we had the values of multiculturalism and integration with other groups of people,

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.760
I think it would have been difficult to realise without the Maz.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.800
And I think that's what the Maz has done for us and has done for many people.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.640
It's brought people together who otherwise wouldn't have come together.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.840
I think that's its essence, really.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.920
You mentioned chanting earlier.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.860
Do you recall any of the chants?

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.920
Would you care to share one with us for posterity?

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.860
Ah, well, yes.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.840
I do recall the chants.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.460
I remember my kids getting very involved with the workshops.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.900
And actually, Tasha, who was quite a small girl then,

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.660
she was probably only about 10 or 11, leading some of the chants.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.660
And, you know, I think we all recorded them as a family.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.280
And they're certainly somewhere around.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.460
I'm not sure if I can remember them well enough to actually sing now, to be honest.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.620
That might come back to me.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.240
No worries.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.700
No worries.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.500
Obviously, after three weeks of workshop, there's the big blowout, the parade itself.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.160
What kind of audience reactions can you recall?

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.840
I remember, in fact, today, because we've been talking about Maz today,

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.740
and I was looking at one of my diary entries from the early days.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.100
And I actually said in my diary that, I think that was the year I was drumming,

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.620
and I actually said, didn't really see anything of the Maz at all.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.060
Didn't really know what was going on.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.000
I was so involved with the drumming, and because drumming certainly wasn't my forte,

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.140
I think I was doing a lot of counting during the Maz itself.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.300
So certainly that one, I didn't really see much of at all.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.020
Gradually, as I got more used to the Maz, I think you tend to look up and look around.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.980
And I just remember huge crowds lining the streets.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:19.720
And I do remember wishing that the crowd would actually interact more with the actual Maz.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.780
And I think, in a way, we were doing it for ourselves.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.820
I think it was a wonderful thing for people, and people kept coming year after year to watch us.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:35.960
But I know that within the Maz group, we were doing it because we wanted to do it more than the crowd.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.300
And personally, I wasn't ever that aware of the crowd.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.560
I knew that they were there.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:55.780
I do remember one year with Jouvet, which is the night before the carnival, cruising through the cafe quarter in Cardiff, which had just then opened.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.460
It was a brand new cafe quarter.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:08.360
And something that we hadn't really ever seen before, people sitting outside on the pavements, drinking and eating, and getting a huge response from them.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:20.460
But during the actual Maz itself, I was pretty wrapped up in what we were doing, really, to be anything other than just vaguely aware of this huge body of people somewhere around us.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.120
Yeah.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.360
Unless you care to give us a chant, I think that was the top-hole interview.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.600
You touched on everything I could hope for.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:31.080
Okay.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.940
I don't feel obliged on the chant front, because Natasha really did sing a heart attack.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:35.240
Yeah.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:35.980
No, that's fine.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.020
I'll leave that to Natasha to take things.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:38.500
Thank you very much.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.480
I'll switch that off.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.100
That was brilliant.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.380
There was a number of...
