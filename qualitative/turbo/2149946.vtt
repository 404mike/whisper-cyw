00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.740
you know when you were born in the country yeah so you were born in the valley yeah but the farm was down in the valleys

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:36.620
we had to go through a gate and then walk down to the farm and your dad was the farmer yeah my father was yeah

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:49.780
was that Astridge or what was the name of that farm can you remember the name no a long time ago no no gosh so when you were small were you

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.620
helping out around the farm yeah what what they used to have you doing what what did your dad

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:07.160
used to ask you to do I know he was on the tractor and on horses plowing with horses then I went on the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:17.760
tractor after that what age were you when you were driving the truck I know small nine or ten and that was quite

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.500
something to have a tractor then yeah because I remember my father telling me you know it was mainly

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.340
horses wasn't it quite a thing to have a tractor yeah can you remember what tractor it was

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:42.960
a fordson major small one before they had the blue ones what color would a fordson be then blue blue the big one yeah

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.480
so you from a very young age then you were working outdoors doing outdoors

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.760
I was walking around with my father when he was plowing yeah and with the tractor yeah

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.240
do you remember the name of any of the horses

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.720
we had two did you

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.680
brown one with the white face and they used to use horses here at the garden didn't they

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:16.240
look before we were all around there's a photo isn't there yeah yeah so when when did you can you

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:25.480
remember when you first came here then Brian first came to Stadpole I think when I went to the anchorage first I think

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.700
I was going to have a very good idea what I was doing

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.780
no

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.040
so you're how old are you now you're 83

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.200
three gosh yeah 84 Monday week

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:53.120
oh really oh did that go on there then yeah 84 Monday week and so what did you do between sort of finishing at the farm were you working other places or

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.420
I went to the golf refinery then

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.000
right right and I grew up working in the canteen

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.860
ah so you they love you in the kitchen if they hear that here

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:16.640
yeah so you think would it would you have been around 50 when you started working here or older

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:30.400
I'm not sure a bit older but a bit older yeah yeah about 20 or so years ago probably I suppose that's when yeah yeah things really got going here

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.680
yeah

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.800
is there anyone else here now who was here when you first came

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:49.440
no no no no so you really are the one that hmm you know what's what then yes okay

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:57.680
so you said to me a little earlier that when you first came here the garden was in a bit of a state

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:08.400
overgrown yeah what was it like what was growing a lot of nettles and brambles and trees trees

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.220
yeah small trees big trees like that

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.120
wow

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:23.540
from the gate you couldn't open the gate it was well you opened the gate but it was full of brambles and nettles so we had to clear it all down

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.040
wow wow so it was like clearing a jungle yeah

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.040
so that was that the first job then just cutting your way in yeah

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:39.180
how would how did you do that hmm what what sort of tools did you use can you remember

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.040
saw secateurs and clippers

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.780
no no power tools no no strimmers back then

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.960
I can't remember no don't think so

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.840
and was there a big gang of you then or was it just three or four

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.880
a few of us

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.500
and was mr bateman here then or

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.700
yes george george bateman ah right

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.380
he was the head grinder then

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.500
and did you see many members of the public in those days were there many visitors

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.580
yeah i think it was a few walk and row right

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.260
so once you once the place had been cleared then was the uh

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:42.640
hmm were there the the area that is now vegetable beds was that the first bit that was cleared

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.960
yeah and we worked on them then do them over

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.040
and were there was there a greenhouse

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.040
hmm was there a greenhouse

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.580
yeah there was but i one year then

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.920
oh right okay

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.240
yeah so you do you remember that first sort of

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.560
spring or whatever planting

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.460
was it you know quite something to find

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.180
make enough space to do your planting

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.020
yeah what do you remember about that

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.400
digging and did you choose what to plant then

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.380
yeah

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.620
what did mr bateman tell you was it who was making digging in the tunnels

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.380
yeah

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.860
or the tomatoes

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:43.780
so that was when you got the tunnels underway was it get just out here or yeah yeah

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:49.000
so you grew tomatoes from an early early stage then

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.480
yeah

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.840
all right

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.340
and what else were you growing back then

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.080
what else were you growing back then

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.080
can you remember tomatoes

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:06.720
yeah onions leeks potatoes

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.560
yeah

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.340
and was there um

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:16.980
pardon

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.760
did you have that little tractor

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.500
was there a little tractor back then

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.080
was that

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.180
yeah we had a small

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.260
forts and major

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.060
right

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.260
was it the same as the one as you'd had at home

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:28.840
no

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.780
no

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.180
small

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.000
grey one

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.440
ah

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.680
but you felt

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.620
sort of okay about the tractor obviously

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:37.240
yeah

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.080
yeah

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:38.280
yeah

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:40.800
and

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:41.780
did you

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.040
how many times a week then did you come was it

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.960
just once a week or

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.940
i think it was

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.140
when we were clearing the

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:54.900
garden

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.840
and what was your general feeling did you

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.780
you know want to come back

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.860
did you find it satisfying to work here

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:04.460
yeah

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.080
in what way then was it more like going back to your

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.880
your roots sort of thing

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:14.180
yeah

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.680
did it remind you of when you were a child on the farm

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:21.960
no

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.400
no

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.820
the tractor and stuff there wasn't

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:25.200
fun

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:25.720
yeah

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.200
yeah

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.080
yeah

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.100
so would the with the crops you were growing then

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.760
you were growing onions potatoes leeks tomatoes

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.500
where where did all of that produce go to

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:43.140
you know they used to take some veg into the shop in harford west

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:43.980
oh right

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.600
next to the one

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.260
next to the pub i think

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.380
what was the name of that spar

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.000
oh yeah

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.560
in in bridge street in harford west or

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:58.880
no

00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.700
uh

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.700
in the town

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.900
next to the king's arms

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.160
all right there you are

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.860
yeah there's a shop there and they used to buy veg

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.460
off us there

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.160
and i think you live in harford west now don't you

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.920
were you living there then

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:17.080
when i was here

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.200
no

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:18.620
no

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:19.640
i see

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.820
because the charity

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:30.260
pembrokeshire mencap was originally started off in harford west so i guess that's probably the link

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.420
for selling the vegetables over there isn't it

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:41.200
did you know ian or you know ian that comes down

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:43.100
from the committee

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.420
yeah did you know him then was he here then

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:51.540
i can't remember i think he was probably did overlap i should think yeah

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:51.920
yeah

00:10:52.960 --> 00:11:00.120
we can hear the um blasting in the background that's the the military isn't it down on castle martin

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.220
you get used to that noise don't you

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.740
on the ranges because it's part of life here isn't it listening to the

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:07.620
the guns going off

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.160
so um

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.040
so you were you would have been coming once a week then

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.880
yeah i think so

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.260
how did you get here

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.960
on the van

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.520
on a van yeah

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.000
like a minibus

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.520
yeah

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:22.820
yeah

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.400
with with other people who were coming to work

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:25.960
yeah

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.740
who would be doing the driving then back then

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:30.980
george basement

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.420
george would come and pick you up what sort of time of day

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.780
half past nine in the mornings

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.160
and then you'd be here for a whole day would you

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:41.520
yeah

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.660
putting a day's work

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.080
you bring your dinner with you then did you

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:46.940
yeah

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.480
yeah yeah you bring your lunch yeah

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:49.400
yeah

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.500
were there women in those days

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.280
any women on the bus

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.120
i think so

yeah

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.160
so what is it you're working on today brian

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.240
oh we're digging the

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.520
sides out

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.340
when we put my pecs on top

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.180
tuck

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.500
tuck it in

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.380
to the trench then

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.160
and then fill it back in

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.220
all right so is that this

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.040
and it'll hold it

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.400
that my pecs down

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.000
this is the stuff that the strawberries will go underneath

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:43.700
yeah

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:44.060
yeah

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.240
make holes in the

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.780
plaster in the mypex

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.440
and plant them through like the tomatoes

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.000
so you're establishing a new strawberry bed isn't it

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:57.520
is that

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:57.820
yeah

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.520
and is that good because does strawberries

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.140
does it need to be sort of refreshed every

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:04.060
yeah

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.260
tell us a bit about that

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.200
they grow better then

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:07.880
do they

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.680
when they're planted with a mypex

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.040
yeah and mypex is like this sort of film like a

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.200
it helps to stop the weeds does it

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:16.360
yeah

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.360
and is it particular strawberries do you grow el santa

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.500
what strawberries do you grow do you know

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:25.840
any kind

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:29.640
they're some they're quite early though aren't they

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.220
because they come i always seem to think they come quite early here

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:41.440
and have people always come to pick the strawberries do you remember people doing pick your own in the past

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:41.940
yeah

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.480
yeah

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:43.480


00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.960
i think they grow better when they're in the mypex

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.960
do they why is that the birds gets at them when they're

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.860
loose and some goes bad

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.920
so we get jays coming in and stealing them don't we

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.340

yeah it was all right

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.200
so you came here with a lot of experience

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.100
you you knew you knew what was what sort of thing

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.140
in terms of the

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.520

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:54.920
yeah

00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:00.800

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.260
keeps you fit

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.500
yeah

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.760
do you ever

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.540
if you ever see the doctor does he tell you you're a fit

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:11.520
you're doing well

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:11.900
yeah

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.740
i saw two not long ago

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:19.520
lady doctors she was going to test my legs but she said there's no need because i was fit

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.460
oh well done

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:20.800
yeah

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.660
she checked my toes and said they're fit

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.220
that's in case you get diabetes isn't it i think

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.560
she said you get a small stand and put your feet up

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:37.160
rather than down because it helps your veins when your feet is up

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:43.600
but she thought you were pretty good well it's bound to be you're moving a lot

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.900
during the day and i would imagine that helps then yeah

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.440

so you get some produce from that yeah what so what do you usually do with what you grow then where does

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:17.780
it go to

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.900
it takes it home man

what do you think of that

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.360
should be good

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.040
different isn't it

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.180
interesting isn't it

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.100
yeah

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:36.740
yeah

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:44.280
yeah it'd be good the day we can all sit down and enjoy a glass of wall garden wine won't it

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.500
that'd be all right

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:45.960
yeah

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.140
that'd be the day

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:48.520
yeah

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:49.700
yeah

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:49.820

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.000

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.440
you're pretty keen to get back to your strawberry bed i understand

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.860
while it's sunny

00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:58.460
yeah

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:01.640
so shall we stop it there and then we'll maybe

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.580
come back to you in the future with a few definite questions

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:07.460
yeah yeah

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.960
maybe when some of the things that you've just planting now we could talk to you about them

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:13.720
yeah

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:18.380
well you know when you start planting it later in the summer and ask you a bit about those

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.060
thank you Brian

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:20.600
