00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
But I love it. Been here 56 years now.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.800
56, same as me.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.360
Same as us.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.180
I wouldn't move from you though.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:09.600
Oh no.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.580
No I wouldn't.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.520
I love badges.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.640
I love badges.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.980
And when I hear people saying about badges.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.760
Oh I love badges.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.740
And I get such a bad name.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.120


00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.940
I get annoyed.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.300
Well it's better than Dufferin.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.220
Well why not?

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.220
Everyone got their badge in good places.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.620
You shouldn't do that.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.120
Should you?

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.980
Well when I was working in the spa room.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.640
On Malpice Road.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.820
There was people at work there.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:34.360
Yeah.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.620
That came from Betis.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.360
And if you heard them.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.360
You never think they came from Betis.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:39.660
No.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.680
Oh everything is bad about Betis.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.380
I know.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.080
And if you want.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.200
I say hang on a minute.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.920
Hang on.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.480
I do.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.860
Stand on the lane.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.100
And watch the children.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.520
The majority of them go up Malpice.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.400
That's what I say.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.680
So don't come here saying about Betis.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.600
I won't have it me.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.840
No.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.740
I don't have it.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.160
Well they got bad and good everywhere.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.660
Even here.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.960
That's right.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.280


00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.200
That's right.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.800
You know the posh parts.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.520
Everywhere.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.220
Yeah.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.780


00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.940
You shouldn't do that anyway.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:04.080
No.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.620
You've got your good and your bad everywhere.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.580
Don't care what you say.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.800
That's it.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:07.060
Yeah.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.860
Anyway.
