00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080
I am married to a gorgeous husband called Mark in Ambulenad.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:14.060
We got married 2014 to September the 5th 2014.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.820
It was the best day of my life I could think of.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.820
A lot of people turned up, Mark's family turned up.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.680
Glad in a way that my family didn't turn up because I didn't want them there.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:49.360
Basically, it was a very emotional time of day because I absolutely broke into tears and whatever because it was an emotional day.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.860
Mark's family broke into tears as well.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.740
We've got our emotional and upset.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.680
Some of my friends were upset on the day because of me getting married.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.660
Happy, upset?

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.620
Happy.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.700
How did Mark propose?

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.200
With a wedding ring.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.300
With a wedding ring?

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.040
Yeah.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.620
Did he plan?

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.720
What happened?

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.920
We got married in a posh hotel in a...

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.980
I can't remember the name of the place but I don't think the hotel's there anymore.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.000
I think it's closed down or somebody's overtaken it.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.840
Basically, we stayed in a hot tub and the hot tub was absolutely out of this world.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:55.760
We were in the hot tub fully naked and we were both absolutely pissed out of our heads.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.740
I meant we were drunk.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.020
I meant we were drunk.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.020
