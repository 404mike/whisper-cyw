00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.740
I'm interviewing Mrs. Ares Williams of Edmonton.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.960
You were asking about the Welsh language.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.600
Now, this is very interesting, Glenys,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.420
because it goes back to the very beginning of what I said about the Welsh church here.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:30.800
This has been a very integral part of the keeping of the Welsh culture of the language,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.100
particularly possibly for my sister's generation and mine.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.440
It was completely Welsh service, of course,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.420
and they carried out the format of the service,

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.200
much as they do in the Welsh chapels in Wales.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.440
And we simply had to go in front during the service,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.880
as many of the children did,

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.140
to recite Welsh verses or verses of hymns,

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.140
biblical verses I was referring to, first of all.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.500
And that, I think, is where we got our real grounding

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.400
of the pronunciation and, well, and the understanding of it.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.240
And though my parents were as Welsh as anyone who ever came out of Wales,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.600
my father was Mr. T. Morris Hughes from Mould in Flenshire,

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.300
and our mother was from Rithyn.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.480
And they spoke every word of Welsh in the house,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.300
but somehow didn't carry on the conversation with Stella and myself.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.560
And we often mentioned it to them in later years.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.000
Mama used to say,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.480
well, you had your grounding in the Welsh verses

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.420
and the way you memorized,

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.800
and it's really rather difficult to understand

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.720
why they didn't keep it up.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.060
We understand practically every word.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.580
And then, of course, I was very fortunate to marry Len,

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.340
who is from Anglesey, from Llanborog, Anglesey.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.160
And to this day, I tease him that he thinks in Welsh

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.580
and speaks in English.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.760
And though we don't converse,

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.560
he has never lost his Welsh.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.180
As a matter of fact, 16 years ago, we went back to Wales,

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.620
and he spoke as fluent Welsh as he did.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.560
At that time, he'd been out here 35 years

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.100
and simply thrilled everybody.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.920
So, of course, he kept my Welsh up.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.220
I used to do a little bit of singing,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.040
and, of course, he did too.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.920
And our son, Glyn, learned his Welsh hymn,

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.920
which he sang as guest soloist

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.240
in San Francisco National Command there

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.920
through coaching by his father, Len, of course.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.320
So we have been very fortunate

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.400
in being able to keep the...

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.940
to a certain extent, the understanding.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.520
But I'm not very fluent

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.240
in the actual conversational French, Welsh.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.100
Would you like to say just a few words in Welsh to finish?

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.580
Well, I rather stun my listeners occasionally.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.260
As a matter of fact, not too long ago,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.180
I was describing Anglesey

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.820
and mentioning about the littlest town there

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.100
with the largest name

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.820
and Llanbair, Pullgwingil,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.900
Gogerrach, Hurran Drubull,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.720
Llandisiljogar Gooch.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.420
And I often play the record

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.740
of the male voice choir.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.240
And I'm always tempted,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.480
which I practically always do,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.760
tell them that it's all right

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.160
to say they're from Hros,

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.800
but for those who know better,

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.760
they come from Hros, Llanbaird, Rhegog.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.560
And believe it or not,

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.460
I found that really more of a problem

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.860
than Llanbaird Peejee.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.900
But, oh, I don't know.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.760
I think possibly I'll carry on this program.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.720
It is unique.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.680
As far as I know,

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.680
I don't think there is another Welsh program.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.020
In North America,

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.060
I had never heard of any in the States.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.760
And I'm quite sure

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.500
there isn't another one in Canada.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:39.860
If there is,

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.180
I would most certainly like to hear of it.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.120
But CKUA is rather a unique station.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.520
It is non-commercial

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:57.080
and just is centered around ethnic groups

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.780
and has been a great help

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.160
to the Welsh community of Edmonton.
