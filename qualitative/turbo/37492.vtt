00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
I attended a School of Erwen primary school, which was the Welsh medium primary school in Cymarthen.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.700
It was the only, and still is, the only Welsh medium school in the town.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:19.140
It hadn't struck me until I reached secondary school how large the school was.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.260
It had 300 or so children, so it was quite a large school.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.560
But at the time, I hadn't realised its size.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.860
Within the classroom, we had a blackboard.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:45.640
Certain classrooms had a revolving blackboard, which was posh in comparison with one blackboard on the wall.
