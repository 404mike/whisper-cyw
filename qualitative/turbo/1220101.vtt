00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.760
I've got all good memories really you know I was very lucky with I had a

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:11.400
really happy childhood I had good parents and other than that had a good

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.160
teenage years we used to go out a lot with friends and parties and cinema and

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.320
all the things young people did in those days

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.140
Were your friends mainly Jewish or missed you?

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.100
mostly because of the clubs you know I went to clubs and that's where I met but

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.460
I had my school friends as well who would always come to a party you know I don't

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.120
I don't remember everything social seemed to be amongst the Jewish community I have

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.480
to say in Jewish friends or we'll have a parties and everybody we had a field we

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.140
had a big garden the bottom of the garden it's all built over now it's we called

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.280
it the wimpy estate it's all built up all behind there we had a field and in the

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.480
field we had chickens and a couple of goats a couple of geese that used to

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.060
frighten the life out of us because they weren't very friendly and a horse which

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.280
was my sister was the horse rider she had a pony I should really say and she

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.900
absolutely loved it even though there's only 18 months between us when you're a

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.280
child a sister 18 months older than you doesn't you know doesn't want to know

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.980
you really so she was the one and her friend a lot of her friends had horses or

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.400
ponies and choose to take it to like pony club events but frightened the life

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.500
out of me I wasn't all sure I may have been daring in some things but of course

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:49.800
riding wasn't for me I wasn't jealous my father did a silly thing to me it was his

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.920
fault I didn't like it's a silly stories I don't know if you want silly stories but

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.260
he made me get on the horse and I got on and then he threw a stick at the horse so

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.040
the horse would run off with me sitting on it and that was it finished I wasn't

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.880
going to put me going on the horse again so it was his weird sense of humor I

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.660
reckon he didn't want to buy another horse so I don't know what made him do that he

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.060
must have thought it was funny

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.120
yes
