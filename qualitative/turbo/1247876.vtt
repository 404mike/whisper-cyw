WEBVTT

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.960
originally I did but

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.320
after so many mishaps I've had

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.960
you know what

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.160
love at first sight can go sling one

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.560
I do believe in love at first sight

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.560
just because of

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.820
love is another part of either friendship

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.320
or

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.740
relationship as well

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.260
that it can bring a positive outcome

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.560
in someone and they kind of you can kind

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.040
of help them to be loved and be secure

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.800
and comfort

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.540
probably you can do that in friendship as well

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.980
yeah but in a different manner but

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.080
love can be either relationship or be a family member or something or

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.700
and I think it was hard for me when I was younger because

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.520
I probably didn't believe it if I was younger but

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.360
as you get older you do because you kind of feel more

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.100
as part of life then that I think you realise that you need someone in your life probably

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.060
to feel that way

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.960
but I think

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.020
I thought I felt love at first sight but I'd say probably about a few years ago when I was starting

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.720
at my college because that's why I want you know college was perfect for me because I knew that

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.400
getting a girlfriend today is quite half and half but

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.100
I had a couple of girlfriends in there but

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.860
it was just

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.480
they lived quite far away but

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.940
you know finding love as well at first sight it's hard

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.040
oh it is like I generally thought love at first sight

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.100
was it when I was going through primary school up into comp and all that

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.580
then into college

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:53.980
yeah and of course I was kind of I've been in about six maybe seven relationships in total

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.320
but the one that I don't think you met or you might have is Jess

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.240
yes that was a couple years ago

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.640
yeah that's when I was living with her for seven months

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.160
yeah that's when I generally thought it was love at first sight

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.560
I know and as we've said it's hard when you're happy and something bad happens to you that you think

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.140
am I doing anything right or wrong

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.280
I know and they won't even tell you

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.620
yeah

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.120
and I think that's

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.260
I think I'm lucky with mine

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.280
when I seen Kimmy and Ponti bus station back January 2017

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.120
well I loved her but she kind of looked down

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.340
because I think she probably felt the same love at first sight

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.620
and we kind of knew there was something there

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.040
so I think that's why we're still together now

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.580
I think my first reaction was

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.500
and they call it puppy love

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.440
yeah

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.440
yeah

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.780
and I think you know

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.880
some of the people are lucky when you have someone you know love

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.920
and you see them first

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.040
you think right is it you know

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.860
that's definitely the girl

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.640
and that

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.340
yeah

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.500
I think

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.280
sometimes you know

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.900
part of life that you might not be lucky

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.420
you might be

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.360
you just want to think positive

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.920
and to say

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.920
hey it's good for it

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.040
then if not it don't work out

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.280
you know

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.920
yeah because there's plenty more fish in the sea

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.500
as they say

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.660
yeah

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.840
but

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.140
love is not

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.720
you know

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.000
it's a very powerful source

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.440
I think

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.160
yeah

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.120
you know for you Alex

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.540
I think it

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.120
you know

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.600
it'll come and go for you

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.920
but I think it's

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.620
because I think it's hard for you

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.760
because of who you are

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.560
to believe it

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.160
and you know

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.860
it's like so

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:38.340
I think

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.020
I believe it

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.620
believe it is

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.040
I thought at one point

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.120
I grasped it

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.380
and then

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.840
out of the blue

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.640
and I was just like

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.240
nah

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.940
I haven't grasped it

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.660
still got to do a few tweaks

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.300
you and me

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.240
but

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.200
I have been doing those tweaks

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.020
but

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.800
yeah

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.840
just don't work as much

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.900
work as much as

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:03.640
what it was

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.760
without the tweaks

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.760


00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.880
the tweaks

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.980
Let's go.
