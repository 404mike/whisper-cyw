00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:21.740
What is your full name? Helen Lewis John. Do we have permission to record this interview? Yes. Where and when were you born? Swansea in 1932. How did you meet Father Paul Satori?

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:39.640
I received a letter in 1979 from a friend of my Aunt Nell's. I took it to work because I didn't have time to open it.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:55.220
When I read the letter I was shocked and upset as Frances was because she assumed that I had known about my Aunt Nell dying and being buried.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:11.800
And the fact that Aunt Nell was a very staunch Catholic and the fact that she had just been buried without the Eucharist, the Requiem Mass, that upset us very much, both of us.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:22.000
So the person I spoke with at work was a Catholic and attended the church in Haverford West.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:29.040
So she took me down in our break to seek Father Saulte Tauri.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:37.000
So I showed him the letter and I did explain to him that I was now a lapsed Catholic.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:45.240
There was no sense, he wasn't judgmental at all, he didn't, you know, he didn't criticize or anything.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.300
He was very, very sympathetic, very, very kind.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.820
And he said, I'll do my best to find out what happened.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.480
And I'll speak with you in a few days time.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.320
Which he did.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.320
He actually rang his brother in Swansea, who was also a priest.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.800
And he got the information from him.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:24.460
And then when he rang me again, he said that because I was a lapsed Catholic, I was no longer a Catholic, he wasn't allowed to give me a service in the church.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.080
But he arranged for me to go to the little convent in Haverford West.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.400
And the mother superior there conducted the service.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.260
And it was lovely.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.600
You know, and it, it, what did it do?

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:48.760
It made me, gave me the courage to say goodbye to my auntie Nell, who I loved dearly.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.540
Yeah.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.380
So was that your earliest memory of Father Paul Saulte Tauri?

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.080
Yes.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.520
Did you ever meet him afterwards?

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.960
No, unfortunately.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.340
How would you describe him as a person?

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.660
I know if you only met him the once, but what did he, what did he come across as?

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.080
He came across as a, as a very kind, outgoing person.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.760
And I would think, I don't know, that he would have had a lovely sense of humour.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.760


00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.520
Can you think of, do you have any other stories of Father Saulte Tauri or did you have any other connection with him?

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.840
Was it just that one incident?

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.500
That was just, that was, that one incident.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:43.860
That's, that's when he, the hospice was founded, I made a, I make a donation.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.000
I've got a direct debit and I make a monthly donation to the foundation.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.120
I feel that's, that's all I can do to say thank you to him.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.720
That's marvellous.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.820
That's the plan, that's excellent news.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.840


00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.280
I think that's kinda what happens you're really short Ã©taient and told her to me.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.280


00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.500
thousands of, you know, I'm not alone, it is just my time I'm, it came across

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.680
the model didn'tovator years since I played a film and not film as much as we shown up on

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.800
a theater that Mattisa was actually took the atau wood at fantasy.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.800
