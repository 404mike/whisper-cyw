00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:15.620
Jill Jones talking to Shirley Davis, continuation. So Shirley, when the Minera Limestone Quarry

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.580
closed, can you tell me a little bit about what happened next there?

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.060
Yes, it was closed for quite some time and there were a number of us in the village who

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.760
were quite concerned about what was going to happen in the line works, what the future

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:40.860
of it was going to be, because it was an area where many of us did walk, but it was becoming

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.360
very overgrown, we were finding it more and more difficult to get in and out of there.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:57.240
And we heard via my husband actually, who was on the council at the time, that it was up

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:06.920
for sale. And as a result of this, a few of us got together. We got together in the City

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:15.020
Arms, which was a pub that was open at the time. And at that first meeting I was appointed

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:24.260
as the chair of a new group, which was looking into what we could do about the quarry, about

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:32.120
the line works. We then went for a brainstorming session, which was up in the cycle centre up

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:42.100
in Sandengla. Yes. And we formed a committee and from that committee we then decided that

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.260
we were going to do our level best to get it for the people of the community, the community

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:57.620
of Monera, for them to have it as a facility. Yes. For the whole area. Yes, as an outdoor,

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:08.340
general access. Yes. And many of the meetings went on in my house. Yes. Yes. It was open

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:16.260
house. We continued to meet. We struggled, we really, really struggled very hard trying

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:23.720
to get people to listen to us and to agree to us doing, having something done with it.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.860
Yes. And it was only eventually when we managed to get the North Wales Wildlife Trust on board

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.640
with us that we were able to secure it for the people of the community and make it a facility

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:47.160
rather than what was becoming an eyesore and a problem. Yes. So we, we, I then stepped down

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.940
from being the, the chair. Yes. And it was taken. I've been a couple of chairmen after

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.720
that. Yes. But, um, I'm quite pleased to say that, um, as a result of, of the efforts that

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.440
the group made, it wasn't just me, but it was the group. Yes. The committee was really good

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.240
and hard working. Absolutely. Yes. And met on a regular basis and we, we managed eventually

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:20.040
to, to, to get the Wildlife Trust on board and, uh, with their help and what have you.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:28.160
Yes. It's, it's now a good. It is. It's a good local facility. Yes. And, and hopefully it's

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.920
going to go on and be an even better facility, um, in, in the future. I think, I think it's

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:44.000
got such possibilities. It's such a, a brilliant area and it's such a large area. Yes. Um, that

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.480
we could do all sorts of things. Uh, I've still got lots of ideas of, of things that could be

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.560
done, but, um, but we've, we've met a lot of people. We've had a lot of important people

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.180
that have come up and looked at the area. Yes. Yes. Um, and have all said, you know,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.700
what, what a wonderful area it is and what a wonderful, uh, thing that we should do, um,

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.300
that we were doing to, to actually try and save it for, for the community. Because there's

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:23.880
the industrial, archaeology and there's the general wildlife anyway. And, um, there's,

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:35.780
the nearness for the community. Yes. And even if they don't walk the mile and a half to

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:44.660
get there, so we need car parking space there, uh, they're still, they don't know how many

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:51.980
miles they walk once they're in. Absolutely. Absolutely. Yes. Yes. You know, it's, it's a place

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:58.800
of entertainment, it's a place of, of learning. Yes. It's a place of, well, education. It's

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:06.760
a place of, um, leisure. Yes. People just go there leisurely. They, they walk their dogs.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.040
They do all sorts of things within it. And, uh, I think that we've, we've managed to do something

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:20.500
really worthwhile in, in, in ensuring that it's, uh, going to be kept in, hopefully, for

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.700
many, many years to come. Yes. It will be used by the, by the community. Yes. With local,

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.460
with local open access. Yes. And everyone. Yes. And I do, do meet people now when I'm up there,

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.880
uh, I do find that some of them now, we do have Welsh speaking people going up there quite

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.420
often. Going back years ago, most of the people that were up there were Welsh speakers. Yes.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.280
Um, most of the quarry workers would have been speaking Welsh, singing Welsh on their way back,

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:56.540
they would be, um, yeah. But now, for a long time it's been a lot of English speaking people,

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.780
and now it seems to be going full circle. It's turning back. Absolutely. And we seem to be having

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.560
a lot of Welsh people up there and, uh, you know, taking more notice. We do have lots of

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:13.500
foreign people coming as well. Yes, we do. Yes. Uh, yeah. Yeah. So, I don't know that I can

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.860
extend that one more point. Well, that's it. So, thank you very much, Shirley. You're very

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:23.960
welcome. Very enjoyable to talk to you today and for you to come and meet us both. Oh, I've

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.200
enjoyed it too. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.800
Thank you.
