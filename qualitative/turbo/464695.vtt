Has television influenced your leisure time over the years?

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:04.640
How has it?

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.800
Not a great deal, no, because we came from a family that really,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.000
as I think I pointed out too, when you first phone,

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.060
television was not the main thing, as you see when we go into some friends' house,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.780
a great big thing stuck on the wall.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.060
When ours was always discreetly put in the corner,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.540
it was a very nice veneered cabinet, didn't it, worn with doors.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.620
And for some reason, everyone used to cover them with cloths in those days.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.480
Why was that?

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.400
What?

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.560
My friend-mum was telling me yesterday, when I was saying you were coming,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.060
her mum always used to put a big cloth over the television at night,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.080
and my mother too, whether they felt that it would keep the picture clearer

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.240
or whether it would keep the rays away.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.920
And at one time, we were told not to sit within three or four metres of televisions,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.440
weren't we?

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.920
But I don't know if that warning still exists.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.980
We never hear of it now, do we?

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.240
Usually the engineers used to advise where to put it and where the seats were,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.340
when we had one.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.760
But no one's mentioned that lately, have they?

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.120
Thank you.
