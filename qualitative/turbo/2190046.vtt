00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.740
I'm Vicki MacDonald and I'm at Holy Trinity Church, I don't know, during The Longest Yarn.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.640
And I'm speaking to Wendy Lonsdale, who has memories of her parents during the war.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.600
Wendy, what do you want to tell me?

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.260
Well, I was born in 1941, so I was always called a war baby.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:31.440
My mother used to, we lived actually in Porthogest and we had an antique business in Port Maddock.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:42.120
So when the phony war came, my mother panicked and thought that the Germans were going to land on Black Rock Sands.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:51.860
And so she started taking all her valuable antiques down into the cellar until I think my father told her not to be so silly.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.900
So that was the first story that I can recall.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.080
And I do remember that my father was in the Home Guard in the first few years of the war.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:18.740
And he was stationed up below Snowden, near Kapilkirig, guarding the line, the pipeline, which was water.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.120
Water.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.440
I gather it was a water.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.060
Yes.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.340
But I didn't hear very much about that.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:42.280
And then at the beginning of the war, anybody who had a house with a spare bedroom was told they had to take members of the services or they had to have somebody to live with them.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.360
So my mother decided, or evacuees.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.000
So my mother said, oh, well, we've got the premises above the shop.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.900
We'll go down to the shop and live over the shop in Port Maddock.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.320
And we'll let a family come and live in our house in Porthogest.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.120
And I'm not quite sure how long we were there, but I was born in over the shop.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.660
And I remember my mother saying to her mother, well, I don't remember this, but she was told, she told me this,

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.120
that, oh, I can't possibly have a baby over the shop.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.300
And my grandmother apparently said, you'd be surprised where you can have a baby.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.160
So during the war, obviously, I was a baby.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:35.940
And my mother took me on the, I think we must have had a, we went by taxi, I think, to Liverpool,

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:43.620
because that's where her mother and father lived in Liverpool, but not in Liverpool itself, out in Great Crosby.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.120
And my grandmother apparently used to say, they'd telephone and say, do you think it's safe to come?

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.500
And my grandmother said, well, there haven't been any bombs recently.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.220
I think you're safe to come.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.480
So then apparently we were, I was taken as a baby in arms up to, up to Liverpool.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.860
And as soon as we got there, the bombs started dropping.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.220
And at nearly the end of the war, my father had then been called up because he was older.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:21.620
He was called up and he was in the Royal Corps of Signals and doing, learning how to do codes and things like that.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.980
And he was, I remember he was in Scarborough.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.720
And for some reason, we went to stay in Scarborough.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:36.040
We went on the train and I can remember going on the train and all the soldiers on the train,

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.260
sort of making a big fuss for me because I was a, you know, little girl.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.460
And we got to Scarborough and stayed there a few days, I suppose.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.400
Those are my earliest memories.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.980
And you told me one memory about your mother and the knives.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:04:01.900
And yes, so because it was an antique shop, she had a lot of, well, knives, very, obviously, very dangerous knives from the Far East.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.240
And there were Dutch commandos stationed, I think, near Harlech.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:16.220
And they came into the shop and wanted to know if she had any sharp knives.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.920
Because we'll get the so-and-sos.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.220
They were going out to the Far East.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.940
They were being, they were stationed.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.160
She sold them the knives.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.700
Oh, yes.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.420
She sold whatever she had.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.920
She was glad to get rid of them, I think.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.220
What else was it?

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.780
So, you had, your mother had quite a busy wartime.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.440
There were other memories?

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:41.340
And the other, yes.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:51.040
Well, so then talking about the being, because I was born in, over the shop, as it were, the house was, she obviously.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.620
Sorry, I stopped the tape for a moment.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.140
Wendy's going to continue.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:03.220
Just to say that we, a family came from London and lived in our house during the war.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.640
Vacuees.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.080
Well, I suppose you'd call them a vacuees, but yes, it was a family.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.780
It was instead of having soldiers, I suppose, because otherwise we'd have had soldiers living in it.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.140
And it was a very nice bungalow in both the guests.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.980
So, thank you, Wendy.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.800
Thank you for your wonderful memories of the war and your mother's war as well.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:33.920
Well, so did you, she survived it all and the antique shop stayed open after the war, did she?

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.100
Indeed, yes, until 1950s.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.320
Oh, that was lovely.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.240
Thank you so much.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.220
Thank you for doing that.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.780
Thank you so much.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.800


00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.800


00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.880
Thank you.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.880


00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.880
