00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
just above Manchester,

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.720
then there were huge cold tips.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.220
So there's a wonderful area to play in,

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:05.520
you know,

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.980
and we'd play all sorts of cowboys,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.680
Indians hide and seek and all that,

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:10.680
you know,

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.440
sort of areas,

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.340
but we'd also have a tin sheet

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.700
and slide down these tips,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.140
you know,

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.840
that was another thing I vaguely remember now.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.280
Yeah,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.980
certainly the cinema had some effect on us,

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.420
but I mean,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.220
we didn't think we could be Superman,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.760
but certainly cows and Indians

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.760
as a big part of being a junior school child,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.000
anyway,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.340
over in the 50s,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.660
obviously,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.920
yeah.
