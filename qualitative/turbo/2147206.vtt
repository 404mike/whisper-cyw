00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.140
Can you please introduce yourself please?

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.380
My name is Raquel Smith.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.320
My name is Raquel Smith.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.960
Can you tell us where you were born and what it was like growing up there as well?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.620
I was born in Pakistan,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.560
I was born in Pakistan,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.020
near Faisalabad, district Faisalabad.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.560
What was it like growing up there?

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.920
It was very nice.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.840
We had a small family.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.280
My father was in England.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.500
He was in the army first and then he came to England to work.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.380
While I was with my mother, grandmother and brother.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.420
So we were living there happily.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.440
How old was you when your father was travelling to England?

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.660
We came to this country when I was 14.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.900
What do you remember? What kind of games did you play in Pakistan?

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:49.420
I remember playing in the streets, sort of an open place.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.260
Because even in the houses we have a yard where we play together, children come around.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.580
And we play in the streets as well.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.860
In our time it was very safe to play there.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.000
Yeah.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.400
Have you got a favourite memory of your childhood?

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:20.120
My favourite memory could be my grandmother being there and friends coming around to play.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.760
And we used to sit together, listen to grandmother's stories.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.260
And having good fun really.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.040
Because there was no TV, only radio at that time.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.680
Is there a certain story you can remember from your grandmother?

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.180
Not really.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.720


00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.720


00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.620
Only remember.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.720
Just talking about different things.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.220
And...

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.680
And is there an event?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.680
An event or a gathering that really stands out to you that you had while you were still in Pakistan?

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.820
I remember Christmas times.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.220
Because I'm Christian.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.540
So, Christmas time was a big thing.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.200
And because my father was abroad, we were known as a well-off family.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.240
And he would send the money.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.920
And Christmas time, all the people in our room, nearby, would get together in our house.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.800
And little presents were given to them.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.300
And it would be really a joyful time.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.820
Mixing with children.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.380
And it wasn't a massive, big presents.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.940
It was small presents and some food given and things like that.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.320
So, we weren't spoiling up large, big things.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.580
So then, you're 14 years old.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.980
And you're travelling to the UK.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.140
What made you decide to come to the UK?

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.720
It was my father and my tata Soba.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.720
The mother, my brother and myself.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.360
It was hard in a sense.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.980
The mother was very excited.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.040
She was meeting her husband and going abroad.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.480
I don't understand why I wasn't happy.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.800
Because I was leaving everything I knew behind.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.900
I think all the aunty, uncles, all the friends behind.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.520
But, it was good as well.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.560
Happiness as well.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.560
But still, you were sad as well, deep down.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.840
Living the country.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.360


00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.920
Was there anything you were expecting?

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.000
Did you have a vision inside your mind of what the UK was going to look like?

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.140
Not really, no.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.020
Yeah.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:57.540
Being 40 year old, it was quite hard to just think why we have to leave and go.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.020
And when we came here, going to the school was the biggest thing.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.920
I didn't know the language.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.460
Even though I went to school in Pakistan, but it was all in Uttu.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.200
And we just started doing English at my age.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.340
And then, you started in class 6, I think.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.200
You started English.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.440
And then, I knew a bit to read and write.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.780
But to speak, there was no chance.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.420
Especially, even if you can speak, when you come here, accent and everything.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.260
Yeah.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.140
Really.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.660
It takes time.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.780
I agree.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.960
So, that was a big 12th of our world.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.880
So, you travelled by plane, coming to the UK.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.340
It was by plane?

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:54.780
Yeah, we came by plane.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.620
Where did you, can you remember where you landed?

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.980
Where did you arrive?

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.600
Heathrow.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.160
Okay.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.620
Heathrow and straight to Newport.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.280
Okay.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.560
I've been in Newport over 50 years now.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.420
Wow.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.100
That's amazing.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.660
And was there any particular reason why your father was in Newport?

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.140
Or why you came to Newport?

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.560
Yeah, he was actually in Bradford.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.700
Because he had friends there.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:26.040
And they were more, I think, industrial factories around there.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:34.880
But he had a friend from Jornawala, where we're from, in Wales.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.040
And he invited him over from Bradford.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.540
He said, come and join us here.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:40.980
Now your family is coming.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.040
Come here so we can meet together.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.660
So that was the reason.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.160
And, of course, is there a certain memory that really sticks out to you when you arrived

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:55.960
into Newport?

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.840
Or around the time that you were settling in Newport?

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.580
Yes, there are a lot of memories.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:03.040
Yes, there are a lot of memories.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.840
The particular one is changing of clothes.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:17.980
From Pakistani clothes, we had to wear English clothes, like in school skirt and things.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.620
That was very daunting.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.940
It was very strange after being covered.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.880
You having to wear those clothes.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.760
That was one of the memories.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.060
It really sticks out.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.980
Yeah, that's something.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.780
That's the first time I'm hearing that actually.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.820
Someone mentioning that.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Because you wouldn't think as much how clothes do pay a factor.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.540
Because that's what you're wearing at home.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.420
That's what you're wearing when you play everywhere.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.600
Everyone you're in Pakistan is that come in here.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.000
Yeah.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.540
It's not everyone.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
It's just my father was a...

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.400
I think you got to mix with the culture.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:04.020
And being a Christian, we didn't have restrictions like you got to be covered.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.700
Even though in Pakistan there was no difference.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.720
Because that's what you call...

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.200
National costume.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.960
Here, to him, national costume was what English people were wearing.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.700
And got to be with the society.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.020
So when did you start kind of learning more about the language?

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.820
I went to school here.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.840
So I started learning the language there.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.980
And there were special classes.

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.300
And there were Pakistani children as well.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:45.660
And with the teachers I would communicate small words by writing down.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.580
And answering back, written down.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.240
They would write down for me.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.000
And there was no other help around.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.680
So how about friends?

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.540
Did you start kind of growing friends as well?

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.740
Or are the more that you have been settled inside of Newport?

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.420
Yes, we made friendship.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.820
My main friends were Pakistani people because of the language.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.020
And some of them are still my friends.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.820
We kept on as family friends after.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.980
Where in Newport have you lived actually?

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.480
Since you've been here for 50 years.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.040
I live around the Han Post area, you know, Ruska Road.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.720
Around there.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.680
Well, we moved around a bit.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:38.320
I think the very first time we came, the first home was in Pill.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.440
My father was there.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.760
And then from there we moved to Mendy.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.800
We lived in the Mendy a year.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.160
And then the rest of my life been in the Han Post area.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.660
Up and down the streets.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:53.920
Yeah, because you're quite high up now.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.300
You're actually going up the Han Post.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.940
Does that mean that you used to kind of go to Bellevue Park and things like that as well?

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.300
Yeah, I lived to Bellevue Park and still do.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.640
It's one of the...

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.740
I think really memories are there.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.760
Because from school we will walk to the Bellevue Park before we go home.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.580
I went to different hall.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:21.140
So Bellevue Park is quite an important park in my life.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:31.360
So, after coming here did any of your friends from Pakistan or even family, other family members join you in Newport?

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.080
No.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:33.120
No.

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:33.840
No.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:33.900
No.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:35.200
No.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.780
Because it wasn't easy to get visas and things.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.000
So...

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.420
How about you travelling to Pakistan?

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.360
Have you been able to...?

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.540
Yes, mum and my husband used to go more often.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.580
But the husband doesn't come yet.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.680
Yeah.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.000
Came too early.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:57.500
Yeah, but I got married.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.580
When I got married, I went back.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.200
I did not go before that.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.660
Yes, we got a big connection at this moment in Pakistan.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.080
We started a charity.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.100
We are in a village nearby where I am from.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.960
Which is running a school for poor children in a small village.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:24.040
And they needed a church as well, so they built up a church.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.220
The school is our responsibility.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.080
I got all the community here involved in it.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.320
And it's good really well.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.240
So we got a big connection there.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:35.880
We go up and down.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:39.860
And with the media now, we're on the video calls.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:44.540
And so it's really important.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.160
When I was young, I didn't have that connection.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.960
Only stories I would get is when mum will go back or my husband will go back.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.860
But now I've been through times.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.220
What does that connection feel like for you to have now?

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.900
That connection that you didn't have when you were younger,

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.420
what does it feel to have that now and to also provide it for other people?

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:17.720
It is really satisfying that the connection is.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.500
It's keeping in touch with your roots.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.500
And plus we're trying to change lives of people.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.580
We've got a good life here.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.720
And those children did not have any education, no school.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:38.380
And it is really satisfactory that you can make a change in people's life.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:44.100
And the project, when we were asked to do something for the village,

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:47.860
and I'm not from the village or my husband's not.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.460
And it was just a pastor who reached us and asked us if we can help.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.780
Because they think people living abroad are rich.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.960
And they can do anything.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:03.220
But we said we will go back and find out and let you know.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:08.760
So we took up this responsibility and God is always there to help us through.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.180
Because fundraising is not an easy job.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.440
And we are getting there.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.060
And we got the building, which is really lovely.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:24.120
And children seeing their behaviour running around from the street to being,

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.760
sitting down to get some education.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:33.830
And this will change for the country, these children and changing their families.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:38.170
It's a really satisfying project.

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:44.270
And this, like I said, all my friends, everybody you know,

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:45.770
is always willing to help.

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:49.170
The fundraising, anything they can do.

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:51.110
It's always there.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.270
It's amazing, amazing to hear.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:59.790
And that togetherness that you just mentioned of your friends and people that are around you here,

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.790
also assisting you in fundraising.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.070
This is without any religion, without any restrictions.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:08.170
We are just friends.

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.570
We try to work for this community.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:19.530
And speaking of work, what type of jobs have you kind of had while you've been here in Newport?

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:27.750
I have worked in shops, like shop assistants.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:33.950
I think little time in the factory as well, the production factory.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:39.170
But my main job, being in school, as a language support worker,

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:42.110
and under 512 worker.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:47.390
And I think that's where my real heart is, to see children progress.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.370
And get into life.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.670
Education is the only way, I believe, to change people.

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:56.270
Give you progress.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:02.390
And I tend a lot of, since I retired, I'm a volunteer worker.

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:11.410
And can you tell us a bit more about your family in terms of your husband,

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:17.190
and how that came about, and then growing up from there as well, in terms of you being married?

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:24.330
Yes, I was married at the age of 21.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:27.450
And I was arranged married.

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:34.890
And we have lived happily since then, and it's 47 years now.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:43.330
We've got three girls, who are very successfully educated and settled in their life.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.690
And six grandchildren.

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:49.890
Can be handful when they're together.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:16:01.290
So then, balancing your work, and family, and being in this environment as well,

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:07.370
what kind of other things in terms of groups or anything like that did you start being exposed to,

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:10.850
or did you start joining any groups, yeah, at all while you were here in Newport?

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.270
Basically, I joined the groups when I retired.

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:25.470
And, I was looking for a way to go, what to do.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.470
I started to go into Coffee and Love at Eaton Road.

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:33.210
And from there, a friend, Sucra, introduced me to Age Alive.

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:47.710
And Age Alive is a very successful, very friendly, satisfying.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:54.170
It's like a family group now, because I've been going to it for about 10 years.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:56.990
So I can make places.

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.610
And I'm a secretary for the group.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:05.490
Once you're with Age Alive, you always got a job there.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:08.470
They get you to do everything.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:17.590
Roy, who runs Age Alive, is a person who gives his 100% to it,

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:22.650
and he expects everybody else to give their life to it.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:26.790
But I do try my best and try to do what I can.

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:32.390
But it is a group that everybody should join.

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:36.650
It's so satisfying.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:38.870
It's given people a home.

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.670
Like, some people got nobody.

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:46.570
And once they join Age Alive, you got a family there.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.030
We were really friends with everybody.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:52.270
Everybody's willing to help.

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:55.690
Fantastic.

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:56.350
Thank you.

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:57.190
Thank you very much.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:00.390
I don't know if there's anything else that you would like to share at all.

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:04.850
That's all, really.

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:05.790
Yeah.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:09.170
Fantastic.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:10.410
Thank you very much.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:10.430
I'm coming back.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:10.490


00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:10.990
Let's go toχ dBA.

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:10.990


00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:11.430
Thank you.

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.510

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:12.010

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:12.010


00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:12.010


00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:11.990
