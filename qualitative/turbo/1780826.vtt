WEBVTT

00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.820
and I'm just going to say at the top of the tape that I'm Marsha Marnie and I'm

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.660
with Margaret Prosser and I can't say the name of your farm what's the name of

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:25.960
the farm? Cronin's farm and it's Rudry. Rudry? Yes, near Caffilly. I thought we were near Caffilly and it is Friday September the 6th 2019 so I'm just gonna pop that down there

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:55.880
and when we were coming over the hill I could see I thought are we near Caffilly? I couldn't believe it I didn't think we were that close. Yeah you came up this road here. Yeah, yeah. So you're looking across there it's a different perspective because it's gorgeous looking across the levels there isn't it? Yes, yes it is. Yes, yes, yes. And then when you get on the top there you can see Clevedon Pier. Really? That's amazing. I might have to come back when it's a clearer day. Yes that's right. Yes it's not so clear to

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:24.080
today. No. I suppose we've had it rain this morning and that it makes it more limited. You've met Marjorie Neal have you? Yes I've met Marjorie. Yes, yes. Are you related to her? No, no we're great friends. Oh really? Oh really? In Farmers days. Oh crikey. Yes, yes, yes. Oh yeah everyone's it's so lovely everyone I have to say Margaret that everyone I've met have been just adorable and so open and welcoming it's just such so lovely making my job so much easier.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:45.780
Because Marjorie was born down on the Moors. Yeah. Would you know Steph Davis? Oh what's her maiden name? I can't think of her maiden name now. She was born at Lower Newton House I think. Stephanie. Stephanie.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:58.740
I can't think of her maiden name. I can't think of her maiden name now. I'll think of it. But I wonder if we can just start off if you could just tell us when you were born and where you were born.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:15.900
And I was born at 31 Herbert Avenue, Risker. As I say my mother was a farmer's daughter and my father was in the steel works you know. And we moved from there then to Park Place at Risker.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:31.140
And we lived there for quite a few years. And then we moved from there then and took the farm at Langoes. And that was 19... oh dear... 1946, 1947. That's right.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.240
And then I moved back down then to Slewis in 1956 when I married. Dear Wim.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:49.880
So what was your father's name? William Benjamin Thomas. And your mother? Minnie Harris. Oh that's a nice name, Minnie. So your father worked in the steel works you said. Where?

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.760
In Pontimister Steelworks which is not there at the moment. That was taken down some years ago. Was that in Newport?

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.980
Risker. Pontimister Risker. Yeah. So he wasn't a farmer at all?

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:13.100
No. No. No. No. And then he had his sister Evelyn Mary Thomas and she was 44 years in Risker at a radio in a letter to shop.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:21.160
And then his other sister, Aunty Phyllis, Phyllis Thomas, she was a teacher up in Abercrombie.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:34.820
And they lived in... I've got to think of the name of the place now. Oh dear, it's terrible. They lived in Woodland Drive in Rogerstone.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.480
I don't know whether you know that area, do you? Do you go to Risker at all?

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:45.280
Not very well at all, no. You don't? No, no. You go up through Woodland Drive, Rogerstone up to Risker and then of course you carry on up the valley then.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.740
So your mother was from a farming background? Yes, yes. Where was she from?

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.220
Near a house farm, Pantig, near Pontipur. Or New Inn it was really. So how did she meet your father?

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:10.060
Well I think my grandparents on my father's side lived in New Inn and I think daddy should go back and forth to see them and that's how they met I suppose.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.000
It's funny how people do meet, don't they?

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.120
So your father had to learn how to be a farmer then, presumably?

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:23.060
Yes, he was always interested. His cousin used to keep the Mardie farm, Kukunu, just below the Kukunu Gulf Coast.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.600
Yes.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:31.960
And he spent a lot of time there. So that's, you know, he really got fed up with the, as the saying is in the stairworks.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:43.840
So he thought they'd branch out and they had this farm in Langoes then. And we took that over Lock, Stock and Barra. We took over the, when they say Lock, Stock and Barra, we took over the stock and rented the farm there.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:51.780
Okay. Yes. Langoes and I liked Langoes very much. We looked out for the door and you could see the Penavan.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.040
Oh he has. Yes. And 1947 was a winter. Oh terrible.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.900
Was it really?

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:04.000
Oh shocking yes. I mean we had tremendous snow. The milk didn't go from there with the lorry for over a week.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.560
Wow.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.820
Because we were snowed up.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.140
Yeah.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.100
Right to the hedges.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.820
Crikey.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:21.700
And then there was a camp of Italians at Bolch and there was another, the Germans in, Italian, German soldiers in Brecon and they cut through really.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.900
Yes.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.360
Really?

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:32.760
Yes. It was, it was horrendous. So, and then I used to go to school in Brecon then from Langoes and walk up to the, hell I used to hate school.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:43.140
I'd rather be home doing the work there. And, um, there was a cycle sometimes, but walk at the times and I used to really dawdle you know.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:50.980
And then I'd hear the train coming around from Talgat to Brecon and stop at the Langoes Hall and I'd try to, but no I never got there and I came home.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.160
And then my father, I said, look you cannot do this you see. You must, you have got to go to school.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:03.840
And I said, well I don't like school. So I left when I was 15. So, uh, that was my story of schooling in Brecon.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.360
Crikey.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.600
Yeah.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.120
So how old were you when your family moved down here? Or when I say here, over there?

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.000
Oh, to Berryhill.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.740
When, so, where is Berryhill?

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.440
It's on the main road, go through Castleton.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:16.800
Yeah.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.920
To Newport.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.880
And before you get down to where there's a big, uh, walk over the bridge.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.360
Yes, yeah.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.860
Well, it's on the right hand side.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.320
Oh really?

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.960
Before you get there.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.460
Yes.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.040
Yes.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.540
It's not there now. Is it gone? Is it all gone?

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.700
No, the farm is still there.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.200
Is still there?

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:36.960
Well, they were, uh, pick your own. But, um, they, they, they, they haven't done that for some time now.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:46.500
And, um, there's a bungalow that's built next to it, uh, which the person that took over after my mother and father finished, uh, he was there for some time.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:53.240
Um, well I tell you who was there was Robert Peel. You know, Robert Peel, the, or something, it's his grandson, but his name is Robert.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:53.740
Really?

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.360
Yes.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.040
Amazing.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.140
So why did your parents move from Nangorse? Why did they come here?

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.860
Well, because, um, well, it was a bit, a bit bigger farm.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.180
Mm.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:09.360
And, uh, we like this area more because my parents, well, my father particularly moved from this area.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:09.620


00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:17.200
And, as I say, his, um, his cousin used to farm the farm down below, so he's, there's quite a lot of, you know, there with them.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:22.300
And then, so, so, did your parents move to Sluice Farm or was that you?

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.800
No, I moved to Sluice Farm. I married from Berryhill and I married Dillwyn from Sluice Farm.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.540
So how did you meet Dillwyn?

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.460
Oh, Young Farmers.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:37.940
It's quite, it's quite a matrimonial place to meet. Yes, Young Farmers, that we should belong to.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.740
So was it very active then, Young Farmers?

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:50.160
Yes, we were, yes. Um, St. Maryns Young Farmers went under. But I did belong to the Llynne Sluice Farm in Brecon, or Langorse, when I was there.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:58.060
And, um, yes, we were quite active, you know. Yes, we were fun, different, go to different shows and so forth, you know.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:03.060
But, um, oh yes, it's quite a matrimonial place to the Young Farmers, I think.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:11.540
Really? Yes. I've heard that so many times, people who've met through Young, it must be an informal marriage bureau. Yes.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:12.840
Crikey.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.380
Oh yes, yes. So it's, um...

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.500
So you met Dillwyn and then he was already living at...

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.760
He was born down Sluice.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.820
He was born there.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:36.140
Yes, yes. And he's got two sisters. One is Betty, which is two years younger, older. And she's living in Gloucester. She's 90 now. And then, um, the other sister lived at, um, did you see who met Derek?

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.980
Yeah. Well, Derek's mother was his sister to Dillwyn.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.000
Oh, okay. Doreen. Yeah.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:46.720
She died, um, oh, she wasn't very old. She was quite with cancer, bad. And, um, very sad it was.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.160
Yeah. And, um, sorry, Derek from... So, how have we met? How did you come to meet Derek, excuse me, ask it?

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.880
Uh, well, Derek and Andrew were both through John Southall, who worked for the drainage board.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:58.660
Ah, right.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.160
Yeah. Yeah. So he's a chap that goes round cleaning them and...

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:02.900
Yeah.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:09.480
...you know, talking to all the landowners and stuff. So, John introduced me to... He said, you've got to speak to Derek and Andrew Prosser.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:09.840
Oh.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.740
So that... And then that's why I'm here now.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:13.160
Yes.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.560
Yeah. Very grateful to him.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:20.520
Yeah. Well, my, um, Father Prosser, he was on the drainage board and he was supposed to lend him to different meetings and that, you know.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.380
So that's, um, Dillwyn's father.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:23.580


00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.040
So what was his full name?

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.760
Winford. Winford Prosser.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.140
Winford Prosser. So what...

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:39.660
And his wife was living at Lansoy. And I don't know how they met. Um, uh, let me see. I think, I think Dillwyn's father had a, a housekeeper.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:46.560
And then, um, my mother-in-law, Marjorie, she was Marjorie, she came down to meet her.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.640
And then, uh, they seemed to pat... to get friendly and then they married, you see.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:52.160
I love that.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.500
Yeah. So Lansoy, Lansoy, uh, at the side desk.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.780
So what was, um, uh, sorry, what was his name? Winford?

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.280
Winford.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:00.880
Winford.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.540
So he was on the drainage board, you see.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.460
Yes, yes. And Dillwyn was on the drainage board.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:05.800
Yeah.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.180
Yes.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.880
So I'm getting confused. So Winford is Dillwyn's father.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:09.540
That's right.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:17.060
So Winford was on the drainage board. So what do, what can you tell me about Dillwyn's parents and on the farm and...

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:31.500
Uh, well, um, Dillwyn's dad, um, Winford, um, has got a brother, I'm sure he photographs out there afterwards. Um, Campbell Prosser. He was a barrister of law. And he was out abroad for a long time in Singapore.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.380
Really?

00:10:32.600 --> 00:11:01.480
And then he had a sister, um, which I've got the photograph, the whole family's out there, you can see later in. And, um, then he had a sister that lived in, um, in Cardiff Road. Uh, and then, um, um, Missy Campbell. And then there was Dillwyn who was killed in the war, First World War. And, um, I was Winford, um, well, I'll have to, I can show you the photo.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.660
I want, it's on the wall, so it's easy for you to have a look at it on the wall, really.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.300
Yeah. Yeah. So that was, like, that was Dillwyn's father's side, you see. And do you know...

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:14.240
And they had butcher shops in Cardiff, Clifton Street. Yes.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:19.040
There's a big butcher in there. And, um, that was their business, more or less, you know.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.060
So, but, a butcher shop. Yes.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.280
Butcher shop. So, how, when, when did the farm come into the...

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:34.780
Oh, Winford, um, he wasn't keen on the butcher shop, so he went farming then. So he took over, took sluice then, rented sluice.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:40.280
Oh, right. And then, of course, milk. And then he used to have a milk round, uh, with a milk van and everything.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:48.640
And, um, Dillwyn used to go occasionally when his father had a meeting up in London, but, uh, he wasn't so keen on the, on the milk round.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:55.220
But, uh, he used to do it when his father had to go to London for meetings with the drainage board and that, you know.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.380
So why did they have meetings in London?

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:05.560
I, I, I don't know, really. It's, um, and of course they used to have the meetings out at, um, Maygut, didn't they?

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.740
Yeah. That's the place, is it Maygut? Yes, Maygut, isn't it? They used to have the...

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.860
Oh, Nash. Nash, rather. That's right.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.680
Oh, Pike Corner. That's right, Pike Corner.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:15.540
Yeah. Yeah.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.620
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so, uh...

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:22.760
So, uh, was it, was it a, always a dairy farm then, the Sleuths farm?

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:30.720
Yes. Yes. Yes. They had cow, we had cows and everything, and sheep. But, um, and then we moved up here later,

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:36.900
and then, um, they moved there, but then they went out to the cows, and so the Andrews only got the sheep at the moment.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.800
So then you met, um, Dillwyn?

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.140
Three young farmers.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.120
Three young farmers.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.200
And so, um, uh, what, so where did you marry, actually?

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.860
In Criccourney Church.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:48.540
Oh, did you?

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.740
It's a dear little church, yes.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:49.940


00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.820
It's a house now that's been turned into a...

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:52.440
Yes, Criccourney.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:58.060
Do you know, um, do you know, um, well, you know the main road I said about where this arch goes,

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.560
you're turned down for Criccourney for the golf course.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:00.880
Yes.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.340
And it's just before you get to the golf course. Or just after the golf course, sorry.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:05.880
On the right?

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.640
On the left hand side you've got a little lane up to the church.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:09.720
Really?

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.140
Hmm.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.060
Oh, I don't think I've been to the church.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.720
Oh, I haven't. It's a house now, it's, um...

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.280
Was it a chapel then, or a chapel?

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.640
No, a church. Hmm.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.280
Really?

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.180
Yeah, Criccourney Church.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.320
Oh, I have to go back that way afterwards, I might go and have a look.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:23.140
Yes, yes, yes.

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:23.860
I had no idea.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.200
And, um, I think there's three or four houses there.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:27.680
Hmm.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:32.120
Uh, because there was a farm next to it, but they've gone into, into homesteads, you see.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.280
Hmm. So then, so did you then start your married life at Seuss Farm?

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:37.180
Yes, yes.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.360
You moved in with, with your in-laws?

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:43.020
Yes. No, no, they moved, they built a house. Do you see the house on the side?

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:43.440
Yes.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.400
They built that.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:44.980
Oh.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.480
And then we went into the farmhouse and they built that and went into there.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.420
So this would have been, what, the mid-50s?

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:53.640
Yes, 57.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:54.740
57?

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:55.480
Yes.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.300
So, um, so what was the farm doing then? Was it...

00:13:59.300 --> 00:13:59.920
Milk.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:00.480
Milk.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:01.600
Milk, and milk round.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:02.040
Yeah.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:07.140
Yeah, and they fill the bottles, you know, and wash the bottles then in the little shed that was there.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:07.600
Yeah.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:12.640
That's, um, yes, I've got a photograph here. Excuse me.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.420
How many cows did you have, Margaret?

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:16.900
Pardon?

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.060
How many cows did you have?

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.160
Uh, well, not like they got today, they got hundreds today, haven't they?

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:22.380


00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.660
And they made about 125.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:24.820
Oh, that's dope.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.920
Which is quite, you know, big for those days, I suppose, wasn't it?

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:28.120


00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:28.240
You know.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.140
Nice to get a photograph here, I think, aren't they?

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.600
And that wasn't all hand-milt, was it?

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:36.640
Had it?

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.240
Was that all milked by hand?

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.320
Well, it was years ago, and then they, of course, they went in with the machines then, you know.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.020
This is a photograph of a sluice house.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.160
This was before 1963.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.400
That's where it was when I used to live there.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.220
Oh, crikey.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.840
There was a milk found by there.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:57.220
Yeah.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.420
A dairy there, where they used to rust in the bottles.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:00.820
Yeah.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.220
Cows used to go into there.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:02.600
Yeah.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.020
And then this was the garden.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.160
I mean, Anne's got a beautiful garden down there now.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:06.720
Wow.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.960
And then there was a shed where we kept chickens.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:09.660
Yes.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.060
Um, so it all altered, of course, because all of us is buildings here now, is it?

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.460
This is all changed, isn't it?

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.000
Yeah, all definitely.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.080
I mean, it's all built up.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:17.500
Yes.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.520
Very rural then.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:19.800
Yes, yes, yes, it was.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:20.560
Thank you.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:26.060
And then in this field here, which Father Potter was in the wound, that's where they built the

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.420
house, you can see Wyvern.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:28.080
Oh.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.620
You know, they built that there.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:33.360
Did they build that because Dillwyn was getting married?

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.980
Yes, yes, they built that to go in there.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:44.380
And, um, oh, but I was only thinking the other day, I think it was about 90, oh, I've forgotten

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:44.760
about it.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.700
I was thinking about how much it cost the other day.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:53.220
The bridge cost nearly more to get across the Ream to get to the house than the house,

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:53.520
I think.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:54.080
Really?

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:55.060
Yes, it was.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.660
You forget about that, don't you?

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:57.520
Yes, you do.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:58.220
You have to get across the Ream.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:58.540
That's true.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:59.520
Yes, yes.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:04.140
So what were your first impressions when you moved down there and started married life?

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.500
Um, well, I used to go back and forth there before we were actually married, you know,

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:12.440
and have supper and things with my mother-in-law and that.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:19.320
Yeah, and, um, yes, well, I liked it very much because we had grown with Berryhill, we had

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.640
two fields on the moors as we call them.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:22.300
Okay, yeah.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:28.780
That rented those and, um, so it wasn't any different for me really, you know.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.100
Yeah.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:33.660
And then, of course, we used to go to Young Farmers Club in St Melons.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:34.300
Did you?

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.680
Yes, yes, and the chapel there used to hold the Young Farmers meetings.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:38.440
Yeah.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.340
That's, uh, oh yes, I've enjoyed life.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:46.980
There was a farmer's wife, so I've spoken to lots of farmers, and, um, so as a farmer's

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:53.280
wife would you, would you have been aware of and concerned with all the Reams and the

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.460
maintenance and stuff?

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:59.320
I mean, I guess what I'm trying to ask is, was there very much a clear, this was what

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.740
the woman did and this is what the men did, or was it all mixed up?

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:09.160
Um, well, I think, I, I, I used to enjoy going out and feeding calves and things and that,

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:09.520
you know.

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:14.000
And then when I was born, we used to put him in the pram, put him in the corner of the

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.200
milking shed, and he'd be sat there, you know, watching the cows coming in and out and

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:24.120
in the house and, um, before we had a parlour that was, the milking parlour type of thing,

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.140
you know, where you could get up in the house.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:30.200
But, um, yeah, I've always been, I've always been interested outside.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.980
Um, so I used to spend quite a bit of time before we went to Langhorst with my, my grandparents

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.140
in Newhouse Farm, Pantake.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:39.560
Yeah.

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.120
You know, I just go up there and stay when I was a little tot, you know.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.540
Put me on the bus in Newport and my aunt would meet me in the way.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.660
How lovely.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:48.300
Yeah.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.880
So, did you ever get involved in the bottling of milk down there?

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:57.040
I used to help sometimes and that helped, um, well, Father Prosser used to, you know,

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.760
mostly he'd do that, so I'd have to come back off the round and then wash the bottles and

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:08.300
get them ready then to fill up the next morning. You know, it's, uh, yeah. Oh yes. Oh yes.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.360
Oh yes, I've had a, I've had a very enjoyable life really.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.000
That's, you can tell that it shows in your face.

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:14.540
Oh, does it?

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.540
Yeah, it does.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.260
What about the poultry? Was that the important part of the, the family?

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:23.200
Yeah, we used to sell eggs on the, on the milk crumb quite a lot, you know.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:28.440
And then there was, if there was any surplus eggs then, uh, I used to bring them to the husband brothers.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:36.100
They used to have, um, uh, uh, well, I don't know, what do you call it, an egg, um, centre

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.320
that they would have eggs and then they'd take them out on different rounds.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.040
Where were the husband brothers based?

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.040
Uh, it's, it's, um, Lisbon.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.000
Oh really?

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.840
Yes, yes. But that's all different now altogether.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:48.440
Mm.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.340
You know, it's, places change, don't they?

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:57.420
Yeah. Well, it's interesting, look at the new photograph, because you must have seen enormous change in your lifetime down there.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:02.460
Oh yes, yeah, especially now, uh, more buildings up for stock and everything, you know.

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:02.860
Yeah.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:09.580
And, um, I mean, I, I was trying to keep, well, clean tidy and all this, because, and we used to have a boy living in then, you see.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:10.320
Did you?

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:14.860
Yes, yes, you know the, um, excuse me, you know the kitchen.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:15.400
Mm.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:20.140
You're going for the back door, don't you? Well, that's the dining room, the kitchen for every day.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:20.440
Yeah.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.820
Then there's the kitchen, isn't there?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:22.060
Yeah.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.260
Then there's the other room.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:23.500
Mm.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.420
Well, we used to have a boy living in there.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:25.860
Did you?

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:33.140
Yes, yeah. And, um, he had his bed in there, and there was a stove in the corner. We used to have for the fire, and he had an armchair.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:33.600
Yeah.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.800
He always ate with us.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:35.120
Yeah.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:39.140
And, um, yes, so, um, we always had a boy living in.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:39.560
Mm.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.940
And, and who, who was he? Was it a series of people, or?

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:50.920
Um, well, yes, different, we, we had a few from some brides that didn't live in there, came back and forth, which is, you know, from, or, Cucurney.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:57.900
But, um, a couple of state elves actually lived in there, you know, with us, and they'd eat with us and all this business, you know.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:04.440
But, um, I mean, he had a television, well, not a television, a wireless more like, but he did have a television towards the end.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.040
And, um, yes, we always had a boy living in.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:08.500
Mm.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:13.880
I suppose the, the farm could support that, whereas it'd be difficult to do that today, wouldn't it?

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:17.660
Well, I suppose, yes, it's different, it's the different ideas today, isn't it?

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:17.940
Yeah.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.000
It's, um, different world today, really.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:21.560
Mm.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.860
It's changed a lot, really, with farming, hasn't it?

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:24.300
Mm.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.640
Well, did you have sheep, then?

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:34.420
Yes, we've had some sheep, yeah, pet lambs and something, you know, feed those, and, yes, we had, it's, it's, it's, I can't remember how many, um, sheep,

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.700
we didn't have so many sheep as well now, naturally, because we had the dairy in as well, you see.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:39.080
Mm.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:45.300
It's, um, yes, oh yes, I've enjoyed my, um, my life until now.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.600
So, Ant, um, used to go up onto the sea wall and bring the sheep in on ponies.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:51.960
Yes.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:53.800
Did you ever get involved with that?

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.340
No, not really, no, no.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.220
Um, yes, we put sheep over on the sea wall.

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:14.540
And then, um, uh, my Doreen, uh, Derek's father, Philip, would come over and, uh, they'd have this horse and a little trap thing, you know, and they'd sit in there and then, they'd, they'd go up then to get onto the buss and to bring the sheep up and all this business, you know.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:29.380
And then one day, um, I don't know what happened, but anyhow, the, the pony started kicking the bottom of the buss and, of course, got out of the, out of the showers and left these four or five and the buss and went backwards where it was suffering.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.840
What, backwards down the slope?

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.060
Well, it went back, it went back, back, you know.

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.540
Oh, I see, because the horse had gone.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.180
And there was the showers hanging up on the wall.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:38.760
Were they okay?

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:39.820
Well, they were alright.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.780
And the dog jumped out a bit quick.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.500
And the dog was in as well.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.260
Oh dear, yeah.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:51.680
They used to come over every Sunday and go down and see the sheep and something or sort of those out and bring that for us then.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.380
Because the sheep used to graze on the other side of them?

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.180
Yes, yes.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:00.740
And then to, like, um, the tide used to come in so far, you know.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:00.920


00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:05.100
But they hired the, um, I think they hired the bank then.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:13.880
Um, yes, they did hire it because, of course, the sea, the water was coming, the sea was getting in higher, wasn't it, you know.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.740
Because you're very close to the sea wall there, aren't you?

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.580
Oh, yes, it's on the field really, isn't it?

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:18.880


00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.380
The field across.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.280
Did you ever experience the water coming over?

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:26.260
You see it sometimes if it was very rough, just splashing up a bit, you know.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:33.280
But, um, you know, I never had the thought in mind of thinking, oh gosh, I hope it doesn't come over there.

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:35.560
Never thought of that.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:35.920
No.

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:40.520
Which I suppose it has, well, it's had in some places over the years, isn't it, you see.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.620
Did you ever use the shore where the sheep graze?

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.140
Is there like a picnic spot when you had children were little?

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:52.220
Yeah, we used to go over there and, um, like, in a lot of the, have you been over there?

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.180
You've been over there, of course.

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:54.020
Hmm.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.340
Well, I haven't been over there for years really, so I don't know what it's like.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:04.020
But, we used to have little, little, um, re, what's the terms of water coming in where there's been bits of ditches?

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.300
Yeah, like rivulets.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.100
Yes, yes, yes, mm-hmm.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:12.340
Yeah, yes, we used to go over there with our neighbours, um, Eddins, Snackle Farms, Sluice Farm that would be.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:14.860
The one just on the side of the road.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:21.440
And, uh, yes, we'd go over there for picnics and, uh, yeah, we used to have a, you know, now and again have a good time.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:29.760
Was it, was it, um, uh, was there a real sense of community there then?

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:34.420
Uh, down the village, yeah, uh, you mean the village itself?

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:34.820
Yeah.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:44.920
Oh yes, because those, those opposite the hall, those are all built, you see, um, because when I went down there first there was no houses there then, you know, so they'd been built.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.680
And, uh, at the back of the hall is a little cul-de-sac.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:49.060
Yeah.

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:53.840
That's, the council houses that, further over, they were, they were there when I went down.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:57.560
Um, and different houses being built around there, you know.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:58.500
Yes.

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:05.420
Oh, it's nice of them, I've been, I'm quite upset really, because WI have been a member for 62 years down there.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.100
Have you?

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:06.520
Yes.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:11.020
And, uh, I used to take my mother-in-law, because she didn't drive, Deirin's mother didn't drive.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:25.880
So, when, then, after, uh, lunch, we'd go down on the, the second Tuesday of the month, I used to pick her up and we'd go down, because she was president at that time, and there was the back, the old black stoves, I don't know if you've seen the old, round black stoves.

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:26.100
Yeah.

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:26.920
We used to light that.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.180
In the village hall?

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.120
In the village hall.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:35.880
And then put the chairs and tables up, and then go back then, and I'd pick her up then, after tea then, to go to WI.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.480
And, uh, yes, we did that for years.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:49.880
Um, and then I used to have the milk van then, I had the milk van for a couple of, oh, for about a week or more in the afternoons, to go to, um, a place in Bremde to get a sanding machine.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:57.120
And, um, put in the back of the end, and then we'd do the floor, you know, sand, get the floor all nice and, well, slimming up.

00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:57.440
Yeah.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:57.820
Yes.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.540
Oh, we've had some good times round there.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:00.420
Really good times.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:05.380
So, somebody was telling me that St. Brides WI used to have a canning machine.

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:06.160
Yes.

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.240
Do you know about that?

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.280
Yes, yes, and Mother Prosser had it.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.580
Now, where it is, I don't know.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.220
Yes, because we used to put fruit into our own canning.

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:14.980
Yes.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.080
Hmm, hmm.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.360
I wonder where it is.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.680
Now, I, I've forgotten about that.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.980
I wonder where that is now.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.600
Yeah, now I wonder where that is.

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:30.840
You've got me thinking that.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.620
I'll be trying to explore where it is.

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:40.800
So, would they, would the WI rent it out, or would they take it out to people and say, do the canning for people?

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:43.900
Uh, I could, I wouldn't, I can't say that.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:47.540
I mean, um, I know we used to borrow it and do our own.

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.660
At least Mother Prosser did more than I did, but I'd give a hand, you know.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.540
But, um, that's interesting how you brought up that canning.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.580
That's going to bother you now.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:57.600
I'd be worried about that.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.360
It'd be lovely if it's still around somewhere.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:00.980
Yes.

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:03.840
Yes, it would, wouldn't it?

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.460
And it's still going, the St Brides WI?

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:07.500
St Brides?

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.680
No, no, it's folded up a long time ago.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:10.140
Oh, really?

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:10.520
Yes.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.280
Oh, that's a shame.

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:11.760
Yes, yes.

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.260
So, a lot of the people from there now come to Peterstone.

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:19.680
And this is why I'm rather upset that Peterstone is talking about folding up.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:20.280
Oh.

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.340
Hmm, hmm.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.420
I mean, the secretary, she's moving away down to Swansea, well that's fair enough.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:31.140
The president, she did say that she'd do it for another two years.

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:32.600
Well, the two years has come up now.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:34.420
And no one else wants to take the responsibility.

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:36.720
That's such a shame.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:37.360
It is a shame.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:38.260
It is a shame.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:39.620
And it's been going how long?

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.420
Well, I've been down there 62 years.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.980
That's phenomenal, Margaret.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.320
And it was on a long time before that.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:47.300
Oh.

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.620
Yeah, so sad really.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.500
How many members have you got down there?

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:57.420
Yeah, we, we, there's, there's, um, from St Brides area, around Asda, where people live,

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.220
I expect there's 14 people come from that area.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:07.700
And it, it seems such a shame that, um, you know, no one will take it on.

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.000
After all that time.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:09.860
Yeah, it is.

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:15.340
Because I was president for some years, about seven years, after Mother Pross had given it

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:16.660
up, I don't know how long she was.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.080
But, um, no, it's quite sad.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.680
I was quite, quite, um, upset about it really.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:27.740
But I'm hoping, um, that I, I might join Kevin Mabley, Michael Stone when.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:28.160
Hmm.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.200
Which is nearer.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:29.640
Yeah.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:33.300
But, um, the distance didn't make any difference to me.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:33.880
I was talking about that.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.160
It's the longevity though, isn't it?

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:35.960
Wins and weather.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:36.460
Yeah.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.240
Pick up a couple of ladies from Marsville on the way down, you know.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:39.820
Oh, how sweet.

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:41.200
Yeah, she was just enjoy it.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.060
That's how it goes, isn't it?

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:49.480
So the, um, uh, so you, you said Mother Prosser used to can fruit.

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:50.320
Yes.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.040
Where did, where did her fruit come from?

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:57.520
Oh, well, um, she had, we had plum trees, you know, we had trees, we had plum trees and

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.560
the, um, we had a couple of trees around here.

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:00.960
Yeah.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.000
Plum trees and things and, well, I suppose that was our garden then.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:05.380
Yeah.

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:10.120
You know, and then we'd have beans and stuff like that and, you know, to roast it.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:10.460
Hmm.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:14.180
But, um, yeah, I've forgotten about that canning machine.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.160
So what was the process then?

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.640
So you'd pick the fruit and then wash it?

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:19.020
Yes.

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:19.280
Was it easy?

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.780
And then put it, make a syrup.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:21.480
Yeah.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:23.000
And then put it in the tins.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.460
And then with the machine you'd seal it all.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.400
And that would be a tin fruit.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.500
Gosh, and that would last all the winter?

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.220
Well, yes, if, you know, you make as much as you can, you know.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.220
Or we could.

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:37.100
And, um, yes.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.740
Gosh, I'm glad you thought about the canning machine.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.420
You've got me worried now.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.720
Well, it's come up a few times, you see, so I thought, how curious.

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:45.160
Yes.

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.000
I've never heard of a canning machine before.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.540
And that St Brides' WI has a canning machine.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:52.800
It just sounds really resourceful to me.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.140
Yes, that's right.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:55.740
Yes, yes.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.100
I wonder where that is now.

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:07.820
Did the WI, because in the past the WI has been absolutely fantastic at recording local people and their memories.

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:10.660
Did the St Brides' WI ever do anything like that?

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:17.500
Ah, no, they folded up, as I said, and a couple of them came from there then, which are a few more now.

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:17.820
Mm-hmm.

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:22.220
Because the president that is now, uh, she lives in one of the houses by us does.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:22.540
Mm-hmm.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.800
And of course a couple of her friends have come as well.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:25.360
Mm-hmm.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.760
But, um, as I say, I was quite upset last week when I knew that it was going to fold up.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:30.720
Oh, that is upsetting.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.540
Yes, it is.

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:31.940
Yeah.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:32.600
Yeah.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.700
But there we are.

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:38.120
If people are not interested, you can't, um, can't force people to be.

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:39.120
You can't, unfortunately.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.020
You can try and encourage.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:40.580
Yeah.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.680
But, um, yeah, so.

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:48.980
So as a young woman, a young wife, was it part of your, one's social life, the WI?

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.000
It was really.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:50.480
Mm.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:51.620
Yes, yes.

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:54.960
I went up to London for the two AGMs.

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:55.380
Excuse me.

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:56.020
Just .

00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:02.320
WI was something that you did as a young wife and it's something you've continued

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.480
to do for a long time.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:04.940
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.520
I, um, yes, I enjoyed WI.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:13.140
I went to London for the AGM on two occasions, which is at the, um, Albert Hall.

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:17.260
And that was very interesting where they come from all over the country there and, you

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.520
know, that's, that's gone back a bit.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:25.120
But, you know, being, it, so what struck me about, you know, down on the moors there, that

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.320
it's quite a different landscape, isn't it?

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.120
It's flat.

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:28.540
Oh, yes.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:29.580
You've got all the watercourses.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:29.940
Yes.

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.220
Was that a challenge in some way?

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:36.820
I don't know whether you've found, um, of course there's people living in the church

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:43.120
now, the church was, and on about, oh, what, what am I, five foot, am I, five foot

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:43.460
or nothing?

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:43.840
Mm.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:49.620
Uh, it's up about, um, well I should know, was it, where the Great Flood was.

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:50.620
Yes, yes.

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:51.020
Yes.

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:51.340
Yeah.

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:56.720
And, um, the bank, you can see the bank, now in one of the fields of one of the farms

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.440
up as you go down the road a bit.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:30:58.940
Yeah.

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:05.680
Um, yes, uh, well, I think I'm right in saying that the water molars came up and they lived

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.240
to Castleton.

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.100
Yeah, it was, yeah, because it goes down, doesn't it, apparently?

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:09.520
Mm-hmm.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.380
It's very low, very low.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.340
Did you ever experience flooding there?

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:19.380
No, no, the rens would fill up quite a way, you know, but no, no, we never had any flooding

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.560
as such, no.

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:25.080
What was it like having young children around those things, though, was it ever a worry?

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.300
Um, oh yes, yes.

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:32.340
Yes, now the neighbours further, on the next farm down to, um, was the farm then, um,

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:36.640
they lost a child that drowned in the, in the, um, water.

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:37.380
Oh, oh really?

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:44.240
Yes, yes, yes, mm.

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:49.480
But, um, I suppose you get, you know, I suppose if you're, if you're born down there, you'll

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.280
get used to it.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:55.940
I know the one that's came down, the one down, further on down the road, uh, was from London,

00:31:56.180 --> 00:32:01.080
came down to see the sister, um, came down and brought the little one, of course, went

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:05.440
down the steps and down in the reen there, you know, which is very sad, very sad.

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:06.480
Oh gosh, that's so sad, isn't it?

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.520
Terrible, terrible, terrible.

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:09.520
Yes, but, um.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:15.420
When you first went to Sluis Farm, was there electricity and stuff?

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.980
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.920
Because when I lived in Langoes, we had no electric.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:20.840
No, no.

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.300
I got the Aladdin lamp there, the hanging Aladdin lamp.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:23.540
Yeah.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:29.560
And, um, I've got lots of table lamp that's in there, that's with oil, and, uh, we didn't

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:32.100
have any out-to-water or cold water or anything like that.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:32.800
Yes.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:37.360
Because you talked about the winter of 47, what was the winter of 62, 63 like?

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.740
Uh, I was down here then, of course.

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:40.720
Oh, here?

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:42.440
Yes, yes, it was bad then.

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:42.740
Oh, right, yeah.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:49.160
Um, I used to go up to Castleton with the tractor, uh, to, um, have the lorry to come

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.780
down, you know, to bring it down.

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:51.360
Really?

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:56.300
And then, um, in the evenings then, um, a couple of the locals there, the youngsters,

00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:03.240
he'd, um, they'd taken down the six bells on a, on a, on a big board, drag it down the,

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.240
down the road, you know.

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:06.000
Oh, yes, we had quite a lot of snow.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:07.800
Yes, yes, yes.

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:09.440
But we had more when we Langoes.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.040
I can remember seeing on Penavan.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:12.540
Yeah.

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.040
Uh, down one of the crevices in June.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.640
There was still snow.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:17.380
Really?

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:17.940
Mm, my goodness.

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:18.700
I can see that now.

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:19.120


00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:20.660
Went on and on and on, didn't it?

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.720
Yeah, it did, it did.

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:21.980
Yeah.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:24.880
Did anyone ever go skating on Marines or anything like that?

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.060
Uh, on the, on the lake.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:26.720
On the lake.

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:31.300
Oh, on the, on the, oh sorry, Langoes Lake they used to go, but I mean, well, it was frozen

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:34.600
over and a motorbike went across and I was never known before.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.200
Really?

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.580
It went across the other side.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.540
I've never heard that before.

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:38.720
Mm, mm, yeah.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:39.400
Brave man.

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:39.780
They reckon they did.

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:43.360
But, uh, yes, I should say, but many did freeze, didn't they?

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:43.740
Yeah.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.360
You know, it's just, and, um, yeah, we used to go to the

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:51.200
Langoes, we used to go, we used to go, and, uh, a crowd of us from where we lived in Langoes,

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.180
we used to take one of these little boats.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:57.800
Uh, we used to go down to, and the other side of Langoes is Langasty.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:58.240
Mm.

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.520
And, I don't know where, you've been to Langoes, would you?

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:01.020
Mm, mm, mm.

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:03.080
And if you look across there, there's a little hall,

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:03.500
Mm.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:07.800
About three fields from the end of the river, I said, and, uh, Langoessey Hall,

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.300
and we used to go across there to dances, and we'd take one of these, uh, skiff, uh, boats,

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.540
you know, and we'd row across there.

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:16.360
Did you really?

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:16.700


00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:17.260
And, um...

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.320
That's quite some distance.

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:19.880
Yeah, it was, really.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:20.060


00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:21.960
But when you're young, you don't notice distance, do you?

00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:23.000
I wouldn't do it now.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:23.300
No.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:27.860
And we used to tether it there, and walk up these two fields, go to the dance,

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:29.680
come back, then, and roll back.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:30.620
My goodness.

00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:33.800
Imagine if my daughter was doing that, I'd be, you know,

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:34.380
Yeah, or what we used to do.

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:36.020
It's good our parents don't know what we're doing.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.920
Yeah, yeah, what we used to do then, years ago, when we were young.

00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:45.120
Do you remember the, um, uh, did you ever help with haymaking as a young farmer's wife?

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:49.820
Uh, well, yes, dry the tractor, perhaps, and that, you know, the baling.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:50.240
Oh, right.

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:54.740
And, of course, um, we had, um, I don't know, a photograph, I don't know what I got,

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:59.340
I might have got a photograph here, where, um, we just came up, excuse me, I don't know.

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:01.940
Oh, what's this price here, then, Margaret?

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:07.300
Well, this is when I was, I was, uh, First Lady Chairman of, um, of, um, St. Mellon's Show.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:11.020
Now, you, that was a big show, someone said to me.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:14.260
Oh, yes, oh, it was lovely, oh, yes, oh, fair play, it was.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.400
And I was looking forward to St. Mellon's Show.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.940
So, is it a very strong farming community?

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:23.720
Is it a very close-knit farming community to go there?

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.320
Um, yes, I think, yeah, I think so, yes, yes.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:27.960
You know, we do a lot of things together.

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:35.920
We had two donkeys, and, um, uh, this donkey down Sluths, and then we put her in foal,

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:40.480
and, oh, you've never seen such a sweet thing when this little one came.

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:42.580
I think the whole village came down to see it.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:43.080
Really?

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.600
Oh, just the, the deal thing.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:48.640
Someone told me that farmers kept donkeys because they were good luck.

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:54.600
Well, yes, they, they, they, um, they do, a lot of people have had donkeys with cattle.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:55.900
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.240
But I've never heard that before.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:02.220
Yes, yes, I don't know whether it's, oh, there's the, uh, I spent a little, little one.

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.140
Wow.

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:04.460
This is 1955.

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.560
I sold my sheep and I bought the little sports car.

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:09.960
Is that you?

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:10.340
Yeah.

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.420
No, that's not me.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.340
My, that's my mother and my aunt, but that's the little car I bought.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:15.320
You bought it?

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.480
Yeah, I sold the sheep and I bought the little car.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.460
Oh, I think that's so impressive.

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.020
That must have been very unusual for a young woman then.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:23.440


00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.540
Oh, yeah, we used to have some fun.

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.660
We used to go, um, following the hounds.

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:27.800
Did you?

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.860
Yeah, on the top there, and, um, yeah.

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:35.660
And then one day, um, walking back to the middle of the car, and here comes the local policeman

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.600
with a steering wheel in his hand.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.580
He did the steering wheel off.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:40.080
Why?

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.720
I went to Blackpool and that.

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:42.620
And back.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.100
Oh, my goodness.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:44.480
Yeah.

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:44.740
Me.

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:45.960
What sort of car is it?

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:49.580
It was a, uh, built up, um, Le Mans, the singer.

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.620
It had a singer engine.

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:53.680
I am so impressed with you.

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:55.460
Oh, my goodness.

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:58.320
And then, so you would follow the hounds down on the malls?

00:36:58.480 --> 00:36:58.800
Yes.

00:36:59.060 --> 00:36:59.180
Yeah.

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:01.100
Eric was telling me about that.

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:01.800
Yes, yes.

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:02.840
The Shredega Hunt.

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:04.740
Oh, so where would you go?

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:09.300
And the Shredega Hunt was, um, based then in, um, Baisley.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:09.760
Yeah.

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:12.100
But they've, um, it's all been built on now.

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:12.460
Yeah.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.520
So they've gone up to Gettley Gare.

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:15.220
Yes.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.440
The hounds up there.

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:16.780
Yeah.

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:21.340
So, um, I mean, we use them if we have dead stock or something.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:21.700
Yeah.

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:22.660
We pay so much a year.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:22.960
Yeah.

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.640
For them to pick it up, to take it up to the, uh, Austin, you know.

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.640
But then you would follow them in your car?

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:28.040
Yeah.

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:28.480
Yeah.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.180
And who would you do that with?

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:31.540
And that's on top of Penaline.

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:31.700


00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:32.680
I didn't throw a Penaline.

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:32.900
Yeah.

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.780
That's like an orchard there.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:37.080
Yes, yes.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.400
We used our trees.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:38.840
Hmm.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.400
So did you get apples off those as well?

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.960
Yes, apples and pears.

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.160
Did you, did you ever make cider from them?

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.160
No, no, but we used to can them.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:47.740
Can them?

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:48.300
Hmm.

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:49.400
Gosh, that's that.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.940
So where was the orchard then?

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.140
And this, this, this, this was my...

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.960
So where was the orchard here?

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:54.800
There.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:55.900
Oh, gosh.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:56.400


00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:56.880
Okay.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.700
And this was my garden out by here.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:01.440
Ah.

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.200
Did you ever have horses on your farm?

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:05.560
Um, no.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:06.060
No.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:06.660
No.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:06.980
No.

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:08.020
Not just the two donkeys.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:08.320
Yeah.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:08.740
Oh, he did.

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.120
Oh, gosh, that's me when I was, oh, I shouldn't be showing you this.

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.100
It's 1951.

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:13.640
Oh, please do.

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:17.840
I represented, uh, Lango, Miss Lango, Lango in Breconshire.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:19.600
Really?

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:24.500
So when it was haymaking, would you have had to make all the lunches for everyone coming

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:25.580
in who was helping with the haymaking?

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:29.860
Yeah, usually in the evening I'd cook, uh, cook ham potatoes and stuff like that.

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:30.060


00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.720
They'd come in at supper time.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:32.020
Yeah.

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:33.460
And not so much in the daytime.

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:35.980
I mean, they'd have some in to eat sandwiches or something.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.020
Yeah.

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:39.200
But, uh, I used to cook them in the evening, you know, for them to come in.

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:39.780
Mm.

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:40.460
Yeah, and they'd come back.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:40.680
Oh.

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.920
Yeah, we had a lovely life, really.

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:44.700
And that was me.

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:50.200
So did you ever, you were probably then too young to have ever thatched hay ricks then

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:50.760
and stuff.

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:54.260
Uh, oh, well, yeah, I've seen them then.

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:55.140
Have you?

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:55.640
Yes.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:55.940
Yeah.

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:59.220
When I was at my grandparents, they used to do it there.

00:38:59.380 --> 00:38:59.560
Mm.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:03.540
Uh, but of course we've always had the bans and because of the bales now, but we used to

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:04.540
do small bales.

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:05.360
Yeah.

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:09.700
Um, I think there's a certain amount of small bales now, if I remember rightly.

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:10.100


00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.640
Um, because it's the round ones now, isn't it?

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:13.420
Yes, of course.

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:13.820
Yeah.

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:14.420
Yeah.

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:16.620
Yeah.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:17.740
So times have altered.

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:21.440
So was there any, there's something I've been meaning to ask, and I've forgotten to

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:29.960
ask everybody else, but was there, excuse me, any, any food or, um, meals?

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:30.240
Yeah.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:37.040
So for example, my parents are Irish and it's a traditional field meal we would be have

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:43.240
would be boiled ham, parsley sauce and something called chump, which was potatoes and onions

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.160
and cabbage.

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:44.620
Yes.

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:44.840
Yeah.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.840
Is there anything on the morse that was traditional like that?

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:49.560
Any particular dishes or?

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:50.800
I used to always boil ham.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.400
Yeah.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:55.360
You know, I like boiled ham, it's nice and potatoes and stuff like that.

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.840
Um, no, I suppose, do it.

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:05.560
I think it's, I think it's a thing that's, um, a farmhouse, uh, meal isn't it?

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:05.740


00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:10.000
Boiled ham, potatoes, peas, parsley sauce.

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:10.420
Yeah.

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:12.320
You know, that type of thing isn't it?

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:12.360
Yeah.

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:16.760
So you would always be in the kitchen providing food for people working on the farm?

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:18.280
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.160
Oh yes, yes.

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:19.340


00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:20.200
Yes, yes.

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:26.260
And, um, yes, I used to, um, go out and feed the chicken and things, I used to feed the poultry,

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:31.800
you know, feed the poultry and all that, but, um, yes, and they'd come in then about two

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:35.800
o'clock, ten o'clock and then they'd sit down and it's a supper and then they'd go about

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.220
twelve o'clock, one o'clock.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:37.840
Wow.

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:38.960
Wow.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:43.080
Yeah, yeah, well I just enjoy the hay making, you know, the harvest time was to be lovely.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:43.660
Really?

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.920
Well, why was, what was it, why did you like it?

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:46.580
Because it was just a...

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:52.220
Well, um, I think, well, meeting, they used to come in and, you know, and then, you know,

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:56.880
we'd, um, go hauling the bales and all this business, you know, the loose hay years ago.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:57.260
Yeah.

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:03.280
I thought I had a photograph here of, um, I haven't caught one, but I had a photograph here

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.840
of the, um, oh, what was it?

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:05.880
Yeah.

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:10.040
So do you, do you remember any of the people who used to work for the drainage ball that

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.460
used to come round and clear the reens and stuff?

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:17.660
Um, oh dear, what was his name? Hmm.

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:20.280
Um, I can see him now.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:21.080
Oh, really?

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:26.080
Oh, oh, they look into me in a moment.

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:30.700
Yes, he's just slashed it over the long-handed hook.

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:31.740
Oh, do you remember that?

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:32.140
Down the Broadway.

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:32.740
Yeah.

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:33.880
Down the Broadway particularly.

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:36.320
Um, oh.

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:44.840
Well, the one has died now, back a couple of months ago.

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:45.300
Um.

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:47.720
Oh.

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:49.860
Hmm.

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.820
I can't think of the other gentleman.

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:54.460
I can see him, I can see him now doing this, you know.

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:56.100
Yeah.

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:56.860
Well, that's silly, isn't it?

00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:56.900
Yeah.

00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:58.420
I'll come to you.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.280
You'll come.

00:41:59.560 --> 00:41:59.720
Yeah.

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.280
And so, and so Dilwin was on the drainage board?

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:05.400
Yeah, Dilwin was on the drainage board and his father was before him.

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:05.700
Yeah.

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:06.020
Mm.

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:07.120
So what did that mean?

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:11.300
Did it mean just, you know, was it an important role?

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:16.220
Um, well, I suppose it controlled the reens and everything really, wasn't it?

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:16.580
Mm.

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:21.500
The drainage board more or less, you know, to, um, see that they were cut and the reed, the

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:27.860
reeds were cut and everything from, off the sides, and, I suppose, controlled the, um,

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.000
the gates.

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:29.580
Yes.

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:32.740
They'd open out opposite, at the bottom of, um, the Broadway.

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:33.500
Yes.

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:33.980
Yeah.

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:36.840
The gates are automatic, it's all automatic now, you see.

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:37.080


00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:40.140
Years ago, it used to have to be done more or less by, by hands.

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:40.420


00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:40.940
You know.

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:45.180
So, it's, it's, the mows are very interested, really.

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:45.940
Mm.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.620
Very interesting, aren't they, in different things?

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:49.420
I think so.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:49.600
Yes.

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.100
I think it's fascinating, actually.

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:51.340
Yes.

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:51.920
It's so different.

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:53.300
Um, what about fish?

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:57.100
Did you ever get eels in the reen or...?

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:57.720
Oh, yes.

00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:58.000
Yes.

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:01.060
Down the bottom, down the bottom of the dry, out, sluice, you know.

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:01.320
Yeah.

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:02.840
You used to have eels out of there.

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:03.360
Did you?

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:03.740
Yes.

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:04.200
Yes.

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:04.820
Mm.

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:06.060
What, used to cut them?

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:06.840
Oh, yes.

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:07.660
I used to live an eel.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:08.520
Really?

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:10.520
So how did you catch them and cut them?

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:15.420
Oh, you'd catch them, you know, you'd catch them with a, a, a, a, a, a rod.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:16.640
A rod.

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:17.040
Yeah.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.460
And put something on the end of it, you know, and catch them like that.

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:19.900
Yeah.

00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:21.020
And you'd put them in the bucket then.

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:21.340
Yeah.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:26.640
So as, um, you know, they'd have fresh water, and then you'd, um, you'd kill them and, um,

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:27.020
eat them.

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:28.020
How long would you keep them?

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:28.640
I wouldn't.

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:29.420
He wouldn't.

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:30.100
Oh, no.

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.420
You'd keep them in the fresh bucket for a few days, fresh of water.

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:33.740
Oh, yes.

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:39.140
Change the water for a day until as soon as I get the, um, well, the earthy stuff.

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:39.460
Yeah.

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:41.380
Otherwise you'd be eating earth.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:42.380
So you would do that?

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:43.000
Yeah.

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:43.680
Really?

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:44.260
Yeah.

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:44.620
Yeah.

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:45.900
And then you would skin it?

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:47.600
Skin it and then cook it.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:47.880
Yeah.

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:49.780
Just fry it in the frying pan, chop it up in bits.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:50.500
Really?

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.320
But there were very keen.

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:54.120
I mean, I, I enjoy anything.

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:54.700
Yeah.

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:56.660
Or everything, put it that way.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:56.940
Yeah.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.620
I'm not fed even with my food.

00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.280
I enjoy a lot.

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.520
That's a good free source of food, though.

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:02.660
Yeah, it is, yes.

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.000
What about Elvis?

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:06.180
Was that something anyone ever had down there?

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:06.620
No.

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:07.100
No.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.200
I don't think so.

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.140
No, no.

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:16.020
Down the bottom end of the, the, the, um, drive of Boston, they'd be, uh, you have them

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:16.460
down there.

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:21.300
I'd have to get them up, up through the, um, you know, up the fields, you'd get them in

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:22.740
the, the Boston's.

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:23.040
Did you?

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:23.200
Yeah.

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:24.380
Yeah.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:25.200


00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:26.240
Crikey.

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:26.660


00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:27.260
Oh, yes.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.220
It's, um, it's fascinating really, isn't it?

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.980
When you think back what you've seen and done.

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:33.440
What about church?

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:35.080
Did your family ever go to church?

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.140
You know, when you were down living on.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:37.420
Yes.

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.360
I used to go to St. Peter's Church, which is the big church in the village.

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:40.740
Yeah.

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:41.960
But of course that closed.

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:42.440
Mm.

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:45.140
And, um, it's a house now, prison.

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:47.880
Is that something the whole family would go to?

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:49.500
Uh, yes.

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:52.480
Sunday morning we used to try and go to church on a Sunday evening.

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:52.820
Mm.

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:55.040
I mean, Father Prosser was a church warden there.

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:55.720
Was he?

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:56.300
There was father.

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:56.780
Yeah.

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.340
Oh, yes, he was a big churchman.

00:44:58.580 --> 00:44:59.000
Was he?

00:44:59.180 --> 00:44:59.900
Yes, yes.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.000
And Mother Prosser used to go.

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:02.380
Yeah.

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.120
And do it occasionally.

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:08.320
And, um, they were married, they were married in Peter's Stone Church.

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:12.680
But of course it closed then, a little while after.

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:15.580
And, um, it's a house now.

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:16.620
People's got it as a house.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:16.920
Yeah.

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.320
They were living in there.

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:18.480


00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:18.480


00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:18.900
I don't know.

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.480
Unfortunately, the gentleman died now only last year.

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:25.500
Um, his wife and the child are still there.

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:29.940
But, um, apparently they were, I've never been in there since, naturally.

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:31.680
But they were living in pods.

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:33.100
Were they?

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.420
It's a big churchman.

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:35.520
It's huge, high.

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:36.160
Crikey.

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:36.500


00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:37.380
Oh, yeah.

00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:38.000
Tremendous height.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:38.460
Yeah.

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:40.120
Been at the top of the tower.

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:41.480
Lovely view from there.

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:41.920
Really?

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:42.360
Mm-hmm.

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:43.800
Yeah.

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:44.520
And then...

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.260
Would the congregation have been very big?

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:50.460
Um, well, yes, it varied then.

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.460
You know, it's like, Marshfield is a bigger church.

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:53.680


00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:57.980
Or they do get more, um, congregation there.

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.020
Because I suppose it's in a bigger village, isn't it?

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:00.540


00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:02.860
And that's a nice church too, St Mary's Church.

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:06.680
I've got, um, doings, I've got a rose tree down there for doing.

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:09.460
But I've also got a casket up in the field up here.

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:10.140
Have you?

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:11.740
Of his, um, ashes, yes.

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:12.000
Oh, yes.

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:14.800
And, um...

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:18.480
Do you remember any characters that stand out for you that you remember?

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:22.940
Well, um, before the buildings that are, oh, they're on the other side of the road now,

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:25.440
there were buildings, but not like they are now.

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.040
And there used to be an old fellow living in there.

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:28.660
Yeah.

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:31.220
And, um, Dennis, his name was.

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.640
And, uh, he used to wear a long, long coat.

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:41.140
Uh, he lived in there and there was a grate in the corner where you'd have a bit of a fireplace if you wanted it.

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:45.800
And Dennis, and he'd walk from there then into town, or Rumney.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:46.240
Yeah.

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:46.800
And walk back.

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:48.760
I can see him now, it was in this ages ago.

00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:49.120
Yeah.

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.920
But he had this long, long black coat.

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:57.880
And then there was another one down at, um, uh, the farm down at, um, St. Brides.

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:02.660
And his name was, um, what, he was another character.

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:07.680
They, um, oh, I can't, I can't think of his name.

00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:10.920
He lived in a, in a barn.

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:16.580
Well, they're kind of like, I don't like to use the word tramp, but kind of like a, just somebody who used to...

00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:21.060
Well, they were, yes, they were kind of a tramp type of person, you know.

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:21.400
Yeah.

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:23.560
Uh, Billy Mitch, that was down there.

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:24.360
That's right.

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:28.400
And Dennis used to be in this one, that, um, in our, in our barn over there.

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:29.780
They were no trouble.

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:38.620
I mean, you know, they, um, actually, I think Father Prosser, uh, went over there one day and, and he, he died in the, Boston, and so.

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:39.220
Really?

00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:39.440
Yeah.

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.000
Where to get the police and all that was, whatever.

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:41.680
Yeah.

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:42.320
Awesome, you know.

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:45.740
But, um, no, they were characters about then, weren't they?

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:46.340
Yeah.

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:47.620
Years ago, like that.

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:53.480
They'd, um, uh, well, I can see them, I can place them now.

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:55.400
And it's going back a little while.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.700
Yes, Dennis and, um, Billy Mitch used to call them.

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:04.020
And he'd always, um, and if, they'd reckon as if the aeroplanes were coming over during the war,

00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:09.960
because that was when he was there, down the war, um, he turned his pipe upside down in case he's,

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.340
Oh, isn't that lovely?

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:14.040
Yeah, yeah.

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:14.980
Isn't that lovely?

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:17.940
It was coming from my, when he was thinking of another thing, because they might see his pipe.

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:19.280
Oh, right.

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:22.740
Oh, it was really funny.

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:23.200
Yeah.

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:27.520
Someone was telling me, now, where was it now?

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:29.540
I can't remember.

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:36.440
But, oh, something about that, was it St. Brides, or was it somewhere else there?

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:40.620
I might be wrong, that on the Sunday the pubs used to be closed in Wales.

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:46.760
This is when the border was different, so people used to flood over to here to use the pubs on the Sunday.

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:47.460
Is that right?

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:49.260
Maybe I've got that wrong.

00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:57.780
Um, no, they used to, I, um, there was a law, wasn't there, where the pubs used to close on a Sunday, a lot of places.

00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:58.260
Mm.

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:05.240
But I can't, I can't remember where that, um, you know, it was, um, wasn't with ours.

00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:07.120
I might go that wrong, actually.

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:11.020
I mean, it's, I feel very sad, really, the six bells is closed.

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:11.520
Yeah.

00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:12.300
You know.

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:12.560
Yeah.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:16.640
I mean, and that's, that was, there was two cottages at the side of that.

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:17.020
Yeah.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:18.560
And, um.

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:20.700
Was it a popular pub?

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:21.800
Oh, yes.

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:24.500
Oh, we've had a lot of lovely times down there.

00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:24.940
Have you?

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:26.040
Especially Christmas time.

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:26.420
Yeah.

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:31.920
You know, we'd go down there and somebody would be playing the organ and we'd have a good old sing song and that, you know.

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:32.320
Yeah.

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:32.400
Yeah.

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:35.540
And, um, oh, I think I got a photograph.

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:36.560
Oh.

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.880
I'm boring you with these photographs.

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:38.340
You are not.

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:40.100
I love photographs, Margaret.

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:41.900
I really do love photographs.

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:42.260
Oh.

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:42.340
Oh.

00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:42.500


00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:43.540
Oh.

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:49.900
This is the six bells with all the holeses.

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.700
Oh, no, that's interesting.

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:54.180
I think I might have seen that photograph before.

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:54.640
Have you?

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:54.940
Maybe.

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:58.440
Um, no, I think.

00:49:59.060 --> 00:49:59.900
He was no master.

00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:02.160
Hmm.

00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:04.360
So what hunt, which pack is this?

00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:08.380
This would be the, um, uh, what's it?

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:10.100
Oh, Tredega.

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:10.760
Tredega.

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:10.860
Tredega.

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:11.000
Hmm.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.040
To do the hunt, yes.

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:14.020
And this is the one you used to follow in your sports car.

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:14.620
Yeah.

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:16.680
Yes, that's right, yes.

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:18.620
Oh, and who's this?

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:18.920
Another one.

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:19.260
Hmm.

00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:21.980
And do you know where this is taken?

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:24.280
No, I'm not certain of that.

00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:25.360
Oh.

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:28.340
And, see, there was two cottages at the side of the six bells.

00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:29.120
Oh, yes, yes.

00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:33.300
And then this is, um, what was this, uh, Cairn-Philp.

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:37.040
Uh, only, only now, late, last year.

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:39.520
Because it looks like it's been closed for years, doesn't it?

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:40.220
Yes, it does, yes.

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:41.480
It looks like a mess, doesn't it?

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:42.180
Yeah, yeah.

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:44.900
Yes, it's a shame because we had a lot of fun down there.

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:45.160
Yeah.

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:46.000
Hmm, yes.

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:49.140
I just meant, look, thinking about the St. Melon's show.

00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:49.760
Yes.

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:50.580
I mean, does that...

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:51.100
That's folded now.

00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:51.940
That's folded.

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:52.140
Yeah.

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:54.340
But I understand that was a huge event in its time.

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:55.600
Yes, yes, it was very good.

00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:58.480
We had, we had tremendous, uh, times with the show.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.500
We used to be on the, um, first of all, St. Melon's show was, it used to be at, uh, Rimley,

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:06.960
the, um, the, uh, Rimley Hill.

00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:12.180
And then it came then to, um, oh, what's there now?

00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:12.740
Oh.

00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:19.040
Down the bottom of the Cairn-A, Bakers used to have the farm.

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:20.600
Uh, oh.

00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:25.360
Well, all these, oh, oh dear, I can't think of the name.

00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:30.000
Oh, that's silly, isn't it?

00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:32.000
You know, when you go down now towards Newport.

00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:32.320
Yes.

00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:35.840
All these buildings on the right hand side and this left hand side.

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:35.860


00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:37.080
Like a radiator plant and stuff.

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.500
That's right, that's right, yes.

00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:39.120
Stuff really.

00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.260
We used to have the show there.

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:40.840
Did you?

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:43.900
And then we came then to Cairn-Mabley here down the bottom of this lane.

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:44.080


00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:46.520
Where you came over the bridge by the farm park.

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:46.820
Yeah.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:47.980
We used to have it there.

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:48.620
Oh, really?

00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:49.740
Yes, in the big field there.

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:50.080
Yeah.

00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:55.060
And, um, uh, oh yes, and then we went then to Tudeka House.

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:55.340
Oh, really?

00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:55.340


00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:55.600
Yeah.

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:56.940
But it was never the same.

00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:58.060
Not really.

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:02.360
You know, we used to get, um, I don't know why it was, because it was a nice site.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.340
But, um, we didn't get the agricultural side of things.

00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:07.580
Yeah, it changed.

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:08.940
It changed altogether.

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:09.540
Yeah.

00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:12.100
So where it was used to be by Khoi Kurnu.

00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:12.780
Yes.

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:13.380
What was it?

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:16.620
So where that area is now, it's completely developed, isn't it?

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:17.120
Oh, yes.

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.680
Was it just farmland then?

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:19.940
It was farmland, yes.

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:21.360
It's hard to imagine.

00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:22.760
It is, it is, isn't it?

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:26.540
Before the motorway and everything, it was...

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:31.720
Yes, well of course they're talking about putting another road up onto the motorway.

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:32.040
Yeah.

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.060
I don't know where that's going to happen, I don't know.

00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:35.460
But it was just farmland.

00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:36.280
Yes, yes.

00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:36.980
It's...

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:37.920
It was just a little there.

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:43.000
And it was where all the local farmers would go along there, would they, to present,

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:44.780
show their livestock?

00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:45.700
Yes, oh yes.

00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:47.080
It was a proper agriculture show.

00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.200
Oh yes, it was, definitely.

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.300
Everything was there.

00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:49.660
Yeah.

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:50.120
Yes.

00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:53.680
And the local show now is Macken show.

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:54.560
Okay.

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.720
And that's always on the first Saturday of July.

00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:57.120
Yeah.

00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:58.300
And that's a nice little show.

00:52:58.480 --> 00:52:58.680
Yeah.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.260
And that's the biggest what St. Mellins was, you know.

00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:01.740
Yeah.

00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:05.520
But, oh yes, oh yes, we've had a lot of fun at the shows.

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:06.660
Yeah, lovely.

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:09.820
But there they are, things altered aren't they over the years?

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:10.460
Yeah, they do.

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.080
You know.

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:14.120
I was just going to ask you about the lighthouse pub.

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:17.460
Is that something that locals would have ever used?

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:20.040
Was it, was that something people from out of town would use?

00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:23.440
Uh, have you been down to the lighthouse pub?

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:23.440


00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.480
Oh, it was very pleasant.

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.780
And a lot of people used to walk on the bank, you know, across the bank.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:28.240
Really?

00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:28.660
Mm.

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:32.540
What, would people walk along from the, Cardiff along here?

00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:37.480
Yes, well yes, sort of from Remedy perhaps, you know, walk and then you'd see them go back

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:38.120
and that, you know.

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:38.320


00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:39.360
Yes, yeah.

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.820
Oh, it's very pleasant on there, it's a nice day.

00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:42.900
Yeah, it is, it's nice.

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:45.940
You know, it's, you go up and you can see both sides.

00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:46.460
Yeah.

00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:54.880
I'm sure he was telling me that, um, that people used to, um, stay in almost like a chalet,

00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:58.900
seat shack in, in, on the, by the seawall.

00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:00.480
Is that right?

00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:01.100
At St. Bride?

00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:02.060
At St. Bride?

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:02.360
Yes.

00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:02.840
Or was it?

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:04.840
They've got caravans there now.

00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:09.980
I don't think he meant the caravan, that people would rent out, would come out for the weekend

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:12.280
and, maybe he did mean the caravan actually.

00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:14.420
I didn't think he did mean that.

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:15.720
Maybe I got that wrong.

00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:18.980
But you said people would come out for the day on their bikes and...

00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:22.680
Oh, a lot of people should recite Lotus and Brides.

00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:23.120
Really?

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:23.540
Yes, yes.

00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:24.120
Yeah.

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:25.440
Yes.

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.560
And of course they'd have these little tent things, wouldn't they?

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:29.560
Oh really?

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:30.740
Yes, yes.

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:32.100
You see those down there.

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.500
What, like people would camp?

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:36.120
Yes, yes, they'd sleep in there and then, you know.

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:36.240
Really?

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:36.800
Mm.

00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:39.000
But, what, along by the wall or?

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:44.360
Um, not so much at all, but before they put the caravan sites, because they're a fair

00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.900
big caravan site at St. Bride, apparently, which I haven't been there for years.

00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:49.060
Excuse me.

00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:54.760
And, um, they used to have these little tent things, you know, you see it on the television,

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:55.120
don't they?

00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:55.960
Really?

00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:56.340
Yes.

00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:57.540
Yes.

00:54:57.860 --> 00:54:58.800
Oh, I didn't know that.

00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:02.500
Yes, it's, uh, yeah, times have changed, haven't they?

00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:04.360
Yeah, they have, they have.

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:04.820
Yeah.

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:08.440
There's one thing I have to ask you about, because I was asking about it, because part of what

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:14.500
I'm doing is, um, talking to people who live along the moors, but, um, that includes

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:16.260
people from the gypsy community.

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:16.860
Mm-hmm.

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:21.780
Um, do you remember any gypsies coming through and...?

00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:27.060
Well, when we had ground in, um, we rented ground on the corner down in Simbra, I think,

00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:34.440
um, um, uh, where the gypsy caravan site is now.

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:34.860
Yeah.

00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:34.980
Mm-hmm.

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:40.980
Uh, there was to be the old, she was an old gypsy in the proper old, uh,

00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:41.660
Rhyme top.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:42.120
Yeah.

00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:42.420
Yeah.

00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:46.860
And they were there for years on the corner of our field, and we used to have to just

00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:49.020
pass them, you know, to go into the field.

00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:49.340
Yeah.

00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:50.660
And they'd give no trouble at all.

00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:52.280
But these are not gypsies, are they?

00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:53.180
Mm-hmm.

00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:54.680
They've been unkind, they're travellers.

00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:55.720
Yeah, yeah.

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:56.080
You know?

00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:56.440
Yeah.

00:55:56.760 --> 00:56:02.800
And, I mean, they've got horses tethered, and, oh, but a friend of mine, she saw this

00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:06.700
little tiny pony window, and she thought the pole thing, and I was like, it's wheat.

00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:10.020
She came home and took some hay down to give it to her on the road.

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:10.180
Oh.

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:11.080
You know?

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:11.980
It's sad.

00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:16.040
No, these are travellers more, I think, you know, it's, they're not the proper gypsy.

00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:16.840
Mm-hmm.

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:17.580
I don't think.

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:20.920
There we are, that's life I suppose, isn't it?

00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:22.040
It is, I suppose.

00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:24.300
And there's so many of them now, isn't there?

00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:29.000
So do you know, you go towards Cardiff and Rumley from where it lives now?

00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:29.360
Yes.

00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:34.500
I mean, again, when you first arrived, was that just agricultural land?

00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:35.720
Oh yes, or just fields.

00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:38.900
It's hard for me to imagine.

00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:46.280
Yes, yes, and yes, and of course there's the, or KLG, which is a bit firm opposite, isn't

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:46.440
it?

00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:46.840
Yeah.

00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:53.320
And motor things, but, oh yes, it was all, it's most unfortunate.

00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:59.600
I mean, there's a little house there as you go down towards the caravan site, on the right-hand

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:03.020
side, he was the coalman, it was a saddler.

00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:09.120
And I look at it now and I think to myself, oh, if he came back and saw us, yeah, he'd

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:11.580
be very, very upset about it, you know, yeah.

00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:13.080
He was the coalman?

00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:13.700
Yes.

00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:14.720
So he delivered coal?

00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:17.000
He delivered coal, yes, yeah, the bags of coal.

00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:18.060
Yes.

00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:23.960
Mr. Sadler, his son is still alive, and he lives in Rumley.

00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:24.780
Oh.

00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:29.400
I've seen him for some time actually, but as the house was, it was immaculate, you know,

00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:34.620
but as it is now, the slates are gone and, oh, it's a mess.

00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:35.400
Oh.

00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:36.120
He'd break his heart.

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:40.980
Do you remember a nurse, I'm sure it was Nurse Cox, she was the midwife?

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.140
Oh yes, yes, yes.

00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:46.440
Now, she lived on the top of Pennerland, didn't she?

00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:47.540
That's right.

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:54.000
Well, there were two cottages there, and I'm very friendly with Betty Stevens, her name is

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.200
now, she was Betty Bridge.

00:57:55.760 --> 00:58:02.240
She lived in there, one of those, and her brother, and those, well of course they were

00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:03.500
gone, was that?

00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:04.380
Yes, Nurse Cox.

00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:09.400
And there was another nurse who lived up there too, because Nurse Cox moved down to Castleton.

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:10.120
Yes.

00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:14.120
On the left hand side, as you go down off the main road.

00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:17.180
Oh yes, she used to go around delivering the babies.

00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:17.760
Yeah.

00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:20.600
Did she deliver Andrew and your daughter?

00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:22.180
No, I went into Glossop.

00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:23.520
Oh, did you?

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:25.500
Yes, yes, I went to Glossop, Taz.

00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:25.700
Yeah.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:26.160
Yeah.

00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:28.500
I just stayed in with both of them actually.

00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:33.760
But, yes, you're bringing back memories for me as well.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.180
Oh, well I met her...

00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:40.820
Well, I suppose we've got hedgerows here, whereas down there there's the reens.

00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:41.380
Ah.

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:42.280
You know.

00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:42.600
Yeah.

00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:45.760
But not really, I suppose, no.

00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:47.620
No, the grass is green.

00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:48.760
Yeah, yeah.

00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:51.620
And you drove a tractor from early on?

00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:53.480
Oh yes, yes, yes.

00:58:53.660 --> 00:59:02.560
I drove, when we moved from Langoes down to Betty Hill, on a Ferguson, Ferguson 25, excuse

00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:07.400
me, I did three journeys from Langoes down to Betty Hill, and it took me four and a half

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:07.800
hours.

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:08.860
Really?

00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:12.960
With the trailer behind, with implements and stuff, brought them down to Betty Hill Farm.

00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:20.000
And then when I was going back, do you know the way, do you know Pontypool area, which,

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.140
you know...

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:22.800
I've been to Pontymoyle recently.

00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:23.640
Pontymoyle?

00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:23.940
Yeah.

00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:24.800
Alright, yeah.

00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:28.880
Well, when you go, it wasn't the new road then, because we wouldn't have been able to

00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:29.980
go on the new road anyway.

00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:30.420
Yeah.

00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:35.500
We wouldn't be able to go on the motorway, you know, with a tractor, the same then.

00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:36.540
Yeah.

00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:41.280
And I used to go down past the Holston Jockey on the bottom, and I used to go down the hill

00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:44.380
and knock it out of gear, and go down that hill like the crappers.

00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:47.920
And I often think, well what if something came across the road?

00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:49.460
I'd have another chance.

00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:50.060
Oh my goodness.

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:51.800
You do things when you're young, don't you?

00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:52.340
Yeah.

00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:56.100
Yeah, I did three journeys for that.

00:59:56.320 --> 01:00:01.500
I brought the plow up, and I brought a big trailer up with implements and, and yes, it

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:02.740
took me four and a half hours.

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:04.480
And were you the only child?

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.040
Yes.

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:05.680
Ah.

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:07.040
I haven't even got a cousin.

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:08.120
Really?

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:08.480
No.

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.280
But my two aunts didn't marry.

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:13.000
My one aunt didn't marry, but we didn't have any family.

01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:15.940
And then my uncle, he married.

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:16.200
He didn't have any family.
