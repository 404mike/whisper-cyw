I'm Vicki MacDonald and I am in Holy Trinity Church, Fandedno, during the

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.520
longest yarn and I have Margaret Nightingale with me who was a child

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.480
during the war and is going to share some of her memories and some of the

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.460
memories of her father as well. Thank you Margaret. So do you want to start with

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.680
how it was being a child during the war, how old you were? Yeah well I was born in

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:34.840
1937 so I'd be about seven, wasn't I? Yes. And I remember, I can remember my father

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:43.080
coming home in the auxiliary fireman's uniform when he did his duty there.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.080
You mentioned the RAF? Yes. Yeah he did want to go in the RAF and was accepted

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:56.000
but because he worked on munition for Avros in Manchester and they wouldn't

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
release him so to do his bit for his country he joined the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.880
auxiliary fire service and I do remember him coming home and the uniform

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.600
when he'd been on duty with them but I also remember going into there was a

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.720
shelter down the middle of the street, a concrete shelter and soon as the air raid

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.760
went off we all had to run into the, our parents would carry us and get us

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:33.240
into the shelter and it used to be frightening. Did you feel safe in the shelter?

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.840
Did you hear the bombs falling around you? Was it that close? Yeah I think

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.840
you could a bit you know you were nervous when you heard the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.400
bombs going you know and you were sort of nervous but once you got into the

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.520
shelter all the neighbours were there together so it eased it a bit you know

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.960
but there was that little bit of fear as a child. So did you have a gas mask?

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.560
Yes we did we had gas masks and we had to put those on. Were they horrible?

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.160
You just got used to them you know yeah so I had to put a gas mask on. What about things

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.080
like not eating maybe an orange until after the war or bananas? Were they, was

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.640
that a surprise at the end of the war to find all these fruits that you could

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.080
suddenly eat? Yeah yeah you know you couldn't get anything could you? There were no

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:33.120
sweets everything was on rationing and it was very rare you can get sweets.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.780
And fruit? Yeah it was just, it seemed to be a shortage of everything and I don't

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.420
think we knew what a banana looked like. So did your mum look after you? Did she

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:53.060
do any other work for the war? Did she do war effort? She worked all her married

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.580
life but I can't remember what she did when we were kiddies in the war. She

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.300
perhaps looked after you. She probably took time off you know probably yeah. That's lovely thank you.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:13.140
Yeah my younger sister, well Carol was, she was the youngest so I'm trying to

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.500
think if the war was still on. I'm like, oh Carol was born. So when you were children in

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.140
school you had a saying didn't you? So it's a bit naughty because it's children's

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.500
talk but would you like to repeat it? Do you think a short term would be offensive in this day and age?

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.580
Well it was then wasn't it and we can cut it out if it is. Yeah. So what did you all say to each other?

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:41.820
We were to say to each other if you see a man with a square head run away because it's a German.
