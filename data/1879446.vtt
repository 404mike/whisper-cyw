My name is Johnny Perkins, John Michael Perkins and I've been going to gigs in Newport since

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.560
the late 60s.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.200
I used to work a lot for the Art College and they used to have bands in the Art College

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.120
south on the other side of the bridge there.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.920
They used to have bands playing in the canteen area and everything like that.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.040
They had a little stage there but they didn't have too many because the caretaker was a

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.200
miserable so-and-so and he didn't like staying up late at night.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.480
The last gig I actually done in the Art College was with a three-piece band from the West

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.000
Country and they was called Caracorum.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.560
I think it was a few months later on the telly, only they had a lady singer with them then.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.640
Her name was Chrissie Eind and turned out to be the pretenders.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.520
Most memorable gig I did for the Art College was at the Newport Athletic Club, locally

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.080
as The Knack, and on the bill that night was The Crazy World of Arthur Brown and a band

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.160
called Spring and myself I was the DJ.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.360
It was the early 70s, around about 1972.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.560
Not long after he had his number one hit single, I Am the God of Hellfire, and that night he

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.840
was like three-quarters of the way through his act and he slipped on stage and he cut

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.240
his wrist and he had to go to the Royal Gwent Hospital because he had cut himself and everything

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.680
like that and he had to go down there with all his makeup on and everything like that

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.360
and his long hair and his beard on one side of his face and short hair and no beard on

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.880
the other side of his face and he had to be stitched up and that was very memorable because

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.440
of the gig itself and that event happening and the two bands themselves.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.280
Spring was one of my favourite bands and they came from Leicester.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.560
Very atmospheric and probably the melaton that drew me into them, it was quite an alluring

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.840
sound and everything and the singer Pat Moran was amazing as a front man.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.440
He would stare out into the audience and way beyond and just sort of hypnotise you.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.520
When Spring split up he stayed at Rockfield Recording Studio where they used to reside

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.640
and he stayed on as one of their main engineers for years.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.680
One of the bands I loved but topping the grill that night was the crazy

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.440
word of Arthur Brown and you couldn't have got anyone better to top the bill.
