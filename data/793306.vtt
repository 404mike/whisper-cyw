00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.880
The opera, well now another thing I do about this, because between my grandfather, my grandmother,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:18.040
my mother and my father, my mother's sister, Auntie Elena, sisters were thinking, oh there's

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.400
a great one because of the dressing up and so on, smart clothes and non-smart clothes,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.560
and they were really into thinking of it all the time, and they were singing all the time.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:35.480
I can remember then as the sergeant policeman in the Pirates of Penzance, oh and it was great,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.880
we were singing those choruses and the songs for months afterwards, having learnt them from my uncle.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.040
Did you ever perform in the operas? Oh yes. Well tell me about performing,

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.160
did you perform at the Coliseum? Oh tremendous excitement, yeah, we put in a tremendous amount

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.480
of time. And tell me what it felt like just to walk onto the Coliseum stage and perform?

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:07.560
Excitement, excitement galore. I can remember when acting in Patience, you were Patience,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:16.120
the upper Patience? I told you then, Brass Elmint and everything, they were real swords,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.720
they were real swords, full length sword, lashing away at one another, sword fighting,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.720
and then of course the orchestra would strike up and we'd watch the conductor's face, whether he

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.880
was pleased or not, whether he could play from the orchestra, because he was already looked at

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.280
more than anything else, but the song was very good, very good, and we had some fine singers,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:50.480
and tremendous ovations, tremendous ovations, and if you were a soloist and you warmed the heart of

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.960
the audience with a love song from someone in the operas, it would sound and it could go on and

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.280
go on and go on, and that's how, you couldn't have enough of it, it was marvelous. Then the Coliseum

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.800
was ringing to the rafters with the sound of the people cheering and clapping and stamping their

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.720
feet and doing everything to let the singers know that they'd gone down well.
