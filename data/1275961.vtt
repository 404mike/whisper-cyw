00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
This is chapter 9 of our batch of short stories.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:12.320
This next one is about the soldiers actually coming home after being demobilized.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.240
And the problems that caused for David Lloyd George.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:24.320
In the beginning of 1919, as we've said, at the end of the war, there were 50 soldier mutinies.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:32.000
Over 100,000 men refusing to obey orders, some even forming Bolshevik-style soldiers councils.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.480
They wanted to be demobilized.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:43.760
However, the scheme at the time introduced by Lord Darby meant that those who held important jobs before the war were released first.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:51.680
As they were the last to be sent to war, this meant last in first out and caused significant iron anger in the army.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.560
Especially amongst those soldiers who'd been in the war since the beginning.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.640
After the election in 1918, during which Lord George had promised instant demobilization,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.560
Winston Churchill became Prime Minister of War.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:18.080
And he introduced a new scheme that meant those with the longest service, most injuries, and over 37 years old, would be sent home first.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.760
This wasn't an act of generosity.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.160
It was mainly because he wanted to create a professional army to fight in Russia.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.480
In 12 months, the army was reduced from 3.8 million to 900,000 soldiers.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.520
This did not end their dissatisfaction.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.640
Soldiers returning home received a railway ticket to their home destination.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.040
They also got an out of work donation insurance policy,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:55.680
which ensured them against unavoidable unemployment of up to 26 weeks in the 12 months following demobilization.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.440
They received in addition an advance of pay, a fortnight's ration book,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:09.840
and also a voucher, Army Form Z-50, for the return of their great coat to a railway station during leave.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.080
Soldiers could also choose to either have a clothing allowance of 52 shillings and sixpence,

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.760
or be provided with a suit of plain clothes.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.920
Final leave beginning the day after he was dispersed.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.040
For most soldiers, keeping the 52 shillings and sixpence made more sense,

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:37.040
so they left to go home still in uniform, even with the steel helmet and great coat.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.280
While on final leave, the soldier was technically still in the army,

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.360
so he could now go about in plain clothes or legally could wear uniform.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:57.440
During leave, if the soldier went to a railway station with the great coat, he was paid a pound.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:05.120
The fact was that the soldier was getting, even with insurance, less wages than anyone in work,

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.600
and had very little money when he arrived home.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.720
In reality, these were unhappy and changed men.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.200
As the Manchester Guardian stated,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.960
the last three or four years of these men's lives have been spent in the scientific practice of violence.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:27.520
And it's undoubtedly true, that must have affected them and their behaviour when they came home.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.480
When they left for war, they were told they would return as heroes to a better life.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.160
When they returned, there were fewer jobs, no new housing, rationing.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.120
Many were also generally angry about the way they'd been treated at the end of the war.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.680
In port cities that had been booming when they went to war,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.640
the whole economy had changed for these men and everything else around them.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.720
Shipping companies had been decimated by war, trade was a problem, and their families,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.360
well, the women they had left had changed.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.400
Many had been working in the war industries and their attitudes were different.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:14.640
Not surprisingly, when they'd known about or been involved in mutiny on soldiers' union,

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:22.720
many soldiers became involved in strike action or street violence after they were demobbed.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.560
Many joining or supporting the sailors' soldier and airmen's union,

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.920
which was run as a Soviet, a people's council rather than a standard leader-led union.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.920
As Simon Webb says, many wearing old army great coats or metal ribbons

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.280
often appeared to be ringleaders when violent protests were taking place.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:55.920
Active in industrial dispute situations as organisers of violent elements in the crowd,

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:04.160
that violence is demonstrated by the destruction of Luton Town Hall in July 1919,

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:12.160
which occurred because the British government decided to hold a peace day march on the 19th

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:19.200
July 1919 and across the country, parallel events were set up by local councils.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.920
In Luton, the council decided to have a large amount of festivities,

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.640
but they denied the discharged sailors' and soldiers' association the right to use a local

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.880
park for religious service. So the ex-servicemen decided instead to arrange a rival march,

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.760
a rival to the Lord Mayor's procession. The floats and bands of the Mayor's parade arrived

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:52.080
at the town hall at the same time as a large group of ex-servicemen, who demanded to know why their

00:05:52.080 --> 00:06:00.720
request to use Wardown Park had been denied. They were ignored and as a consequence the town hall

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:07.280
was stormed and stoned. The police managed to disperse the crowds, but at 10 pm that night,

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.280
the ex-servicemen returned crowbars, pickaxes and bricks and broke into the town hall,

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:19.920
and despite the police presence, they burnt it to the ground, joined by civilians.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:32.160
Now Luton is just one example of ex-servicemen reacting violently to the situation they returned

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:40.880
back to. Across the way to the West Midlands and in Swindon and many other areas, there was

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:50.880
riots and looting involving ex-servicemen. Of course ex-servicemen were seen consistently

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:59.280
and were arrested as being involved in the race riots across Britain in June, but even as we've

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:05.040
said upon their demobilization, they still were a problem for the British government

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:12.880
and their disillusionment was an ongoing problem and an ongoing part of the fear

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:22.000
of David Lloyd George and the government that a Bolshevik uprising was not only possible but likely.
