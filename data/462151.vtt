It's a funny thing about television because, and S4C because I suppose it's local.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I remember being in Cardiff and I was walking through the shopping centre and I saw this lady coming towards me.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Oh I know her, what's her name, what's her name now?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You know how your mind goes frantic then, where do I know her from, where do I know her from?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And I thought, oh she's on the television, she's on Poblok, come you don't know her at all, you know.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And I just walked past and I thought, well, it was really, it shook me up because I thought, oh where do I know her from?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
She's going to talk to me now and I'm going to, you know, of course she never heard me but she was on Poblok.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So yes, I mean it's quite interesting to see people, I don't know about icons but, yeah why shouldn't the Welsh people be icons as much as anybody else?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I think it's, I'm not, I can't say I'm a great follower of people who are famous but it's quite interesting to see them in the flesh now and then.
