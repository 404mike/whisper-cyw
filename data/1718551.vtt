00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
My brother and I, we had a ferret as well, we kept in the shed.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I suppose we must have been 11, 12 or something like that.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We'd put the ferret in a sack, we'd take a spade with us, and we'd go miles.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Our rule at home used to be, as long as you got home for mealtimes,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
as long as you didn't get into trouble, or they knew that you got into trouble, you were okay.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But you had to come home for lunchtime, meals times and things like that.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Occasionally we'd take sandwiches with us, and we'd spend all day on the top.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Over about one of our favourite routes was walking down to where the barn is now.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Coming from Cormier Goddages there, if you turn right, there was a path going up the hill there

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
called Camroo, I think it was kind of bent path or something like that in Welsh.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It bends up in Cwmbeddw, kind of farm at the top.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
That was before that was planted, that was all hill, and that's one of the places we used to go rebbeting.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We'd cut across the hilltops to Cavanpole, where Robert Housencraft used to live,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and then come back through the village and over the top.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But with our little ferret, we never used to catch any rabbits.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I don't think it was the name of the game.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Most of the time we'd spend the afternoon digging, because the ferret used to get off its string.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
They'd put a string around its neck and put it down the rabbit hole.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Invariably, eventually the string would go slack and there'd be no ferret on the end of it.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Then we had to make sure the ferret wasn't going to escape from any of the other holes

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and start digging until we got it out.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
There were plenty of little things to do.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
We very rarely used to go off, particularly before we went to secondary school.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
We very rarely used to go to lend-in places.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000
We were occasionally taken on a treat to Pantadora, because the shop there had got a refrigerator and ice cream.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I don't think they did ice cream in the shop in the Abbey at that time.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
That was a treat.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I can vaguely remember.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
They used to actually have a sports day down below the Abbey.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
There are probably other people now, and people like that in the village know more about them than I do.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I can vaguely remember that they'd have a horse race around the field, that somebody would be falling off and things.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
But yeah, there were major events.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Even my memory is so bad at remembering those things.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The things that stick in my mind are going home from school and seeing the red squirrels in the woods just below the runoff there.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
There used to be a wood of really big trees there before the other trees were planted.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
There were big, large trees there back in the 50s.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
There were red squirrels in there. You used to see the red squirrels on the way home from school.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
There were those things that I think we remembered more.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
We used to remember things like Christmas in the school.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Mrs Phillips used to bring along her little bag of one shilling coins to give us all.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
The other thing we had in the village was a youth club organized by the vicar.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.000
In most places, in most communities, the youth club was a facility to get people off the streets.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Youth club in the Abbey was the night when everybody came down to the village and messed around outside of the hall more than the events that the vicar was trying to get us involved with.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
It was the old Phillips hall then.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Yeah, it was a good time.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.000
You mentioned the Abbey, Abbey Kimhir Hall and Mrs Phillips bringing the Christmas treats down to the school.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Were there any other relationships or memories from the hall?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000
When the Fenners took it over, it was immediately after or one after the Phillips left.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000
It was the Fenner family. Martin Fenner was in school with us at that time.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.000
We used to go and play in the hall and kind of have brilliant times running around this stairway.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
You'd go down one stairway, round and down another one and things like that.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
We used to mess around there.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:06.000
One of the things we used to do in the summer, particularly in youth club night, was to have little raids over the wall into the garden.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:16.000
At the time, the garden used to have its aspelliary apples and things like that and plums on the wall on the inside.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
It was a little bit naughty.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.000
It was things like that really that kept us amused.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
I suppose when you're very young, big events tend to pass you by a little bit.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I suppose the village centre was different a little bit.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
At the time, the big conch trees were still there.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
There's one big one right on the bend.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Just next to the pub there.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And then there was another one.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
In fact, I think you can still see this big stump of it.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000
There's a big white stump at the entrance to Owen Farm.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
You can see a massive tree stump.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I'm pretty sure that must still be the old very large chestnut tree that was there.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Then obviously, a couple of years ago, the current owners of the hall took the big sequoias, the big valentonias, those massive trees.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
There were two or three big trees growing just by the entrance.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000
As you're facing the church, there's an entrance going in for the hall at the bottom.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:44.000
On the right-hand side there, there were two or three massive trees, very, very tall.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
They got the spongy bark that you can punch.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
They were very good.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:03.000
We also, I suppose a bit later on, particularly the lads from Home Farm had got an Austin 7 car, which they modified to be able to take in the building.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
They shortened the wheelbase, made it narrower and shorter.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:16.000
They stripped the body off and put a box on the back so they could clean out the buildings, I think was the original plan.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:25.000
It was horrendous really, because we used to take it out on the forestry roads and wander around the forestry roads with it.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Really, you sat on the petrol tank of it, and it's still in front of you.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Was this Mellie and his brother?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Well, it was Colin at the time and Mell, I think.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
But Mellie probably remembers his little Austin 7 that they used to rent.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:58.000
We also, somebody gave us, I think it was some, Tom Griffith from Compoi, gave us his motorbike.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.000
We didn't really have bicycles at home for some reason.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:17.000
But when it was slightly older, we had this motorbike that we used to mess around again on the forest roads, around because you didn't have to worry about licenses and things like that.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
But it was a bit of a wreck as well.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I remember at the end, the cable on the accelerator for it had come off and it was screwed to the lid of the petrol tank for you to adjust the speed.
