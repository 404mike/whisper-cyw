00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is chapter 10 of a series of short stories about 1919

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and the things that were travelling across the desk with dispatches and intelligence reports

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
of the then Prime Minister David Lloyd George.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is about the Canadian soldiers, also waiting to go home,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000
angry about not being demobbed, and it's Canadian soldiers in riots and death.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Soldiers from other countries, as I've said, were also being denied the demobilisation they expected when they left France.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And two major riots involving Canadian soldiers demonstrate their anger and the end of battlefront discipline.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
You have to remember just how rigid discipline is in the battlefront, and then suddenly there's very little.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The first riot was at Kinmel Bay, the army camp near Rhyl, North Wales.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
On the 1st of March 1919 the Canadians refused to obey orders.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And on the 4th of March they elected Sapper William Czarowicz, a Russian-born Canadian, as their leader.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Now, due to an administrative error, the soldiers were short of wages and had no money for alcohol and cigarettes.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So they decided to resolve this by looting the officers' canteen and mess,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:48.000
taking, as an aside, taking the red curtains that were located there and attaching them to poles to make red flags.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
They then left the confines of the camp and attacked Tin Town.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Tin Town was a batch of temporary shops owned by local traders and selling goods to the armed forces of the Canadians.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Well, they destroyed 11 of those shops.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000
The next day matters got even worse when there was an open battle between mutineers and officers,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and non-commissioned officers who were trying to restore order.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
In the melee five men died.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Mutineer Gunner Jack Hickman was shot.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Sapper Czarowicz died from a bayonet wound.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Private David Gilland, who was on the officer side, was shot and two others died.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
No one was ever convicted for playing a part in the deaths.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Fifty men were court-martialed, resulting in sentences of three months to ten years.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Now, Kimmel Bay was a military riot.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000
No civilians were involved, unlike the next major Canadian riot in Surrey.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Canadian soldiers were in a convalescence camp in Epsom in Surrey, on the edge of London.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Here were Canadian troops recovering from illness or injury.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
It was usual for them to get drunk, etc.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000
But on the 17th of June 1919, this got out of hand at the Rifleman Pub in Epsom Hybe Street.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
One of the soldiers was arrested for fighting with the police.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And then another one, John Connors, when the soldiers tried to stop him being taken to the police station.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Later that night, 400 soldiers attacked the police station using paving stones and railings

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
to smash their way into the police station where they were met by 20 or so police officers.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.000
In the middle of this, what happened was all of the off-duty police, hearing what was going on,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
did their best to get to the police station, cycling, which was their main transport.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And 51-year-old Sergeant Green, an off-duty police officer, cycled to the police station when he realised there was trouble.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
But he was struck by a railing during the attack on the station.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Seven men were charged for offences relating to the riot.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Two were acquitted, five convicted only of riot.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And yet Sergeant Green had been killed. No one was charged with his death.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Some were sentenced to a year's imprisonment.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:41.000
However, in a novel twist, in December 1919, the soldiers were all granted a royal pardon and deported to Canada.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Ten years later, Alan McMaster, one of the men convicted of riot, walked into a police station in Winnipeg, Canada

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and confessed to the murder of Sergeant Green.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:01.000
The British authorities, embarrassed by this problem, decided that the matter had been dealt with and he was freed.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Now Sergeant Green, as I say, died in this riot.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Now in 1985, when P.C. Blakelock was killed in Tottenham in London in a riot,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
it was stated he was the first police officer to be killed in a riot in the 20th century.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Now that riot involved black people and it made for a dramatic headline.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
But it was factually incorrect.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So the other soldiers were causing just as many problems for David Lloyd George as his own soldiers.
