WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Yes, exactly. And so we expect this should be about an hour, it should be a little less,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:18.720
okay? So today is the 27th of June. This is Dr. Adiola Darwis, 2019. I'm here with

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.320
Vanessa Cyril. Can you say your full name for me?

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.560
Vanessa Camilla Cyril. I'm posh, but Camilla.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.560
Camilla.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.560
Camilla.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.920
Lovely. And what were your parents' names?

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.400
Carita and Hilton.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.000
Okay. And what were their professions? What did they do?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.240
My father worked on the big ships and my mother done sewing, she done cooking,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.400
she done everything what to do in the Caribbean. But she used to do a lot of embroidery as well.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.160
So, you know, all sorts of stuff.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.120
Did you have siblings?

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.880
Yes.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.380
How many?

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:07.460
Three brothers and three sisters, but I lost a brother when he was age 11. And I lost a sister,

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.620
she was only a baby. What I'd say is called death now that I know.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.460
Oh my gosh. That must have been really traumatic for your mother.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.500
I think my brother may have been thinking of it autistic.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.460
Okay.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.540
And you know, they didn't diagnose it then.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.100
Yeah.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.740
So I lost Elvin to that nice boy.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.580
11 as well.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.340
So he was 11 and my sister was just, I think it was a cut death. My mother got up one morning and

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.420
she was dead.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.780
Oh my gosh. And where are you in the line? Are you first, second?

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.340
I'm the second. My brother's first, I'm the second. I've got another sister after me.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:51.460
And then Elvin, one died, and then Marcella, and Ursula, the makeup.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.260
Okay. So you're the first girl.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.900
Yeah.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.820
Do you remember growing up in St. Louis?

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.540
Yes. Yes. Growing up, well, I think it was quite happy.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.020
Growing up, you know what it's like in the Caribbean.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:14.180
Aunties and uncles and extended families and so everybody was your cousins.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:24.180
And I say sort of waffling in the rain, going up to the country when you have holidays.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.260
Seeing people digging yams and picking the breadfruit and they're watching the bats on their

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.860
cashew nuts. There's a fruit under the cashew nut. Cashew nut on top of this fruit and watching the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.900
bats and all the mango trees and running up looking the river for crayfish. So it was quite

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:52.740
happy. And we didn't live far from the sea actually. We could go out about, I would say, 10

00:02:52.740 --> 00:03:00.420
minutes and you'd be watching the ships come in and there'd be lots of tourists as well.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.340
And not far from the beach, the beach would take you about half an hour because you all

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.220
had to walk then. We'd have all these like buses and things. So we'd walk through shortcuts at this

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.620
chap. I think his father may have been a slave master and he had this big white house on a hill.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.460
Nothing around it but lots of trees, mango trees, gore, things. So we'd walk past there,

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.860
a little shortcut where it was really trees on either side and quite creepy.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.980
You'd go on the beach and sometimes watching the aeroplane coming in and it was not coming across.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.860
And you'd go on the beach and you'd have barbecues like they put stones on and have something.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.980
Frankly I didn't swim because I remember starting to swim and then you were quite

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.180
cruel to sort of duck you in on that. You know children play.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.700
Was that your siblings or your friends?

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.500
Yeah, friends and siblings and Esther swam along, my sister, but I didn't like the thought of them

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.140
sort of ducking you to see if you can get up.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.220
And what year were you born?

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.900
43.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.460
In 43. So it's St Lucia. What was St Lucia like at that time around?

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:20.580
It was like then loads of children around you because people had six, seven, eight,

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:29.780
nine, how many children? And then you had what I can remember from going to school as a

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.020
sort of I would say five years old, four or five, I remember going to school with my brother holding

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.780
hands and the beginning my mother used to take us and after that we'd walk through a big park

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.260
they call the gardens because the school was just overlooking it and we'd walk through there

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:52.660
and we were told not to go on a merry-go-round which we would do after school as well.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:00.260
And we'd get into school. I remember the teachers making dresses and doing all these sorts of things.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.940
We had to go a lot of handicraft there and on Christmas time we'd do all the loops for the

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.860
decorations and all these things and I remember them doing this punch in a thing where,

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.380
I don't know what they call it now, it's like wool or cotton whatever you punch for a thing

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.740
and you can make like horses and animals and roses on this material. Lots and lots of good

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:32.580
things I remember them doing. And also play we skip, we play tiki-taka. I don't remember.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.940
Tiki-taka, no.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.100
Well the stones, you'd have lovely stones, collect nice stones and it's on the ground

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:46.340
we'd play it and then we'd see who pick up. They'd pick up the stones and it would go like that and

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:53.300
over there and try and pick up some more and see. Yes, it's like you throw it up and pick up more.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:06:00.500
Yeah tiki-taka and we skipped a lot. We got the big group from the mahogany tree, you know these

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.460
big groups that would be around the mahogany tree, we'd go and look for that and cut it and

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:12.420
skip with that you know. A bit of time we'd have rooms but it would scratch all your skin you know

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:18.340
and see you can skip better, you can go up, you can go down, you know so lovely time and in the

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.500
rain, running in the room when it's raining you know. We didn't know the rain water was good for

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:29.220
our skin you know and we did run in the rain and I remember what you washed your hair with it was

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:35.780
like the hibiscus leaves at times you'd have your hair washed of that and then they'd use their

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:45.140
aloes, not the aloes, the other flat one. What did Mekans call it? Single Bible? No,

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:51.780
the single Bible aloes. Anyway it was a flat one it hasn't got the um pickles on it and they use

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.340
I think it's a family of the aloes and they use it and they scrape it and that condition your hair

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:03.780
with castor oil in it and yeah and um because I remember confirming my cousin Cecilia was so

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:12.260
talented and first time I had my hair pressed you know and um for my confirmation and you know

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:19.860
doing my hair and then putting it in like brown paper rolling it in brown paper and ready for my

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:25.300
confirmation and she crocheted I think she knitted all socks and crocheted my post she was very

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.220
talented my you know these socks up to here she really knitted them nicely you know um

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:37.460
what did I call it? Cucumber pattern like little holes in it you know very very talented and my

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:45.780
first women dress it was nylon first time I wore nylon and um pleated skirties people done these

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:54.180
things by hand and pleated it under um like um cold um cloth on top of the pleats and

00:07:54.900 --> 00:08:00.100
and then I had tucks all over and then little sequins in the middle and the same just the

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:06.340
sleeves of little sequins and um I met the lady when I came over to Boonum I met the lady who made

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:15.700
that dress so um I was very proud of you know me oh my gosh yeah growing up was quite good actually

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:21.940
um lots of friends calling I think I selected my friend my sister didn't care which was always in

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:28.900
some sort of problem but I was on the other side quiet so I just like my books and have a little

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:39.940
core of friends so um and um then well what would you wear at school and when you had your school

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:45.300
report I was just thinking I said you're trained with that now took it to your god mother and your

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:50.100
god father you took it to your auntie and your father and everybody would tell you well you

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:55.540
better learn better you know do well do well school and the earliest one that to aim for is

00:08:55.540 --> 00:09:02.020
B's probably or is A's nothing below that you know really yeah but I had a wonderful teacher

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:09.460
Mrs. Patterson she had no children she was good you know she gave me some lessons after as well

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:17.460
so um you know I was privileged in a sense and I think the school I went to was quite a good

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:22.820
school this you see the Roman Catholic I teach him about praise and hope

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:31.780
but I had a very good name that school for good academic students you know what I mean that some

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:36.660
of them left and went abroad and studied and got scholarships you know island scholarships

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:44.580
so I must say my childhood I quite enjoyed it you know and Christmas day I'm having new clothes

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.300
and new year's day because we had four holidays

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:56.660
Christmas and new year we had new dresses and there was this like a fair people made ice cream

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:01.540
homemade ice cream made fresh cream like this make that so you'd be going in the day in the evening

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:06.260
with all the people then we were told not to go on the buses because these buses were quite

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:12.740
productive hard seats on big old dodge buses and we'd go but keep our head down in the

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:18.740
tunnel so somebody knew our parents and then we'd be shouting singing you know um

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:26.260
baube baube why are we meaning the policemen have um why are we mean um

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:34.500
wires that's all rotten you know baube why are we and then there'd be a lady I I think she

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:39.140
might about dementia I didn't know children and they used to say Marcelli's a gagging

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:47.780
what does that mean well they say black magic and Marcelli was a black magic person you know

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:54.020
but I'm sure she was deep alley and talking to herself and all this thing but you see she was a

00:10:54.020 --> 00:11:00.420
gagging and well she's a sick driver driver truck let me go they had this music driver truck then

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:07.860
I'm not in a puppy show oh yeah so yeah so it was good meeting your friends and then

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:14.020
I joined the church choir so after choir practice we'd walk around town a group of us

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:20.500
and go and look at the windows you know because I didn't realize St. Lucia was a place for a lot

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:25.860
of the small islands came to shop people from there because it had everything you know um

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.580
so we'd go and look at all the shop windows because you always glass windows of stuff you

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:36.500
know advertising women dressed up in mannequin dress up in materials and clothes and

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:44.980
and then walk around with our friends and um then go home through the lanes that were dark you know

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.660
sounds amazing it really really does when I think of it I said to peter

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:57.700
I had a good friend and we two like dressing the same you know and I remember one new year

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:03.060
he had yellow nylon and it was long wasted a black velcro on the long waist a little black

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:09.460
velcro we thought it was cat's whiskers I need a nice flat shoes in a band across

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:18.580
but apart from that my father didn't um I get hay fever oh gosh shoemaker as well

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:25.940
so sometimes you know he'd make shoes and I thought I don't like it but you know I'm so pleased

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:31.220
because I never had any problems with my foot you know if you have these cones or that you need

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:36.580
somebody for my foot that if I have to buy you should make shoes and that would cost me a fortune

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:43.060
but all the skills these people had or a ship was mostly going to Canada chilling that coming down

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:52.100
because it was a tourist ship um lady Nelson and um all around one of them anyhow there were two of

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:56.660
them and I'd have to wait as soon as he's coming quickly to go and get the stuff because they

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:02.420
didn't spend much time like a day home and then they didn't give them much time out to work come

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:08.900
and visit home and he'd bring me some lovely things you know they've got a nice school bag

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:16.180
and plaid you know and lots of pens and things like that so yeah so um I would say my school days

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:22.180
were quite happy so travel was quite normal as well kind of moving between the islands and I

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:28.660
would go to um my aunt didn't left one of my aunts left to go to Marchenic to work and she worked for

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:36.180
the American Embassy as a cook there and I used to get lots of magazines as well um and so I'd go

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:42.580
and spend time with uh travel on these little aeroplanes then spend time with my aunts so I had

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:48.660
to speak French not just K-all I had to speak proper French introduce me to all these people

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:53.860
and he'd take me to pictures and so it was sort of confusing because he tried to speak English with

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:59.620
me I remember laughing at a young man tried to say the shoe black because in French you say

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:10.980
I always remember that joke he said

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:22.820
in English so um that was nice there because we'd send to the shop deliberately to go and speak

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:27.860
a lot of them speak short as well but you wanted me to speak French by going and buy

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.860
um

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:40.500
and they kissed a lot there was a lot of kissing of the French people because they greet you for

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:45.140
kiss on either side there's only no I think over here they do it in Britain I mean the last few

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:51.780
years because you never used to you know and shake your hands and so and then they kept lots of

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:56.420
wine and they'd give you a damn of red wine and a damn of white wine they never drank tea

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:03.380
and they'd get cups of coffee and um when you went everybody you know in my teen years they'd

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:09.300
offer you some red wine these little um aluminium tumblers you know and you say it's good for you

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:14.100
it's good for you to drink but now we know what red wine is good you know so god has a big damn

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:20.100
jar of red wine wow and where I saw an open supermarket before they had it in central

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:25.380
showers in Martinique and the cakes and things were beautiful like all shampoo and all this

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:30.820
open supermarket and I remember her giving me dope shampoo and they still have it in France

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:36.500
I went to France once it's still a dope shampoo and this and you know I was watching the fur and

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:42.100
saying god how lovely it's open so it's not just here like in supermarket was open and the party

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:50.740
said the cakes were beautiful you know so I made friends they haven't got their numbers or anything

00:15:50.740 --> 00:16:01.380
now but growing up I made friends in Martinique as well and um then met Peter you know went to

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:10.340
you know teenage dance so we all got my sister and I got a teenage dance and a whole group of us you

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:17.460
know because this was this teenage dance a different holiday and um it was a gang of girls

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:23.380
standing up and talking and then I think he asked my sister to dance so he came which one he said

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:27.620
he asked her and I don't know she asked somebody else asked her to dance so then he said can I dance

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:34.420
and you know we all danced and we all so then because the boys asked me to all my grandchildren

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.780
I started teenage dance I went to a teenage dance restaurant

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.900
I was lovely dressed for a combo by anybody

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:53.140
so um that was it and um Peter was sort of um imprinting and I worked for a little while

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:57.140
because I was waiting to go into nursing I was still young so I worked for a little while

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.820
through a chap while in a big shop I was doing the bookkeeping sometimes we even go around and

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:06.500
we didn't have all these things that were the big ledgers and doing the bookkeeping

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:12.260
still laying each other to watch out I think they were quite prominent and his brother had

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:17.540
a lot of the supermarkets back home and I used to do that you know all the people a lot of the

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:22.500
people got to know them and um between that

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:32.100
and then my brother came over

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:39.060
no more aunt came over here in the 50s my husband was here before I think he came over the same as

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:49.380
the queen queen's coronation and an aunt came over and then my dad sent my brother over and then

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:56.100
Peter came then after and my sister came before me

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:03.380
because my mother said let her go up Esther was different King was quiet on the side

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:11.460
Esther was always in a scrape so she came up but she wouldn't stay in Newport my aunt thought oh

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:17.220
she's here she left because my aunt then was older having children and she thought Esther had

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:22.500
invested it off to London which all her friends we did that's what we've seen everything happening

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:27.860
in London you know dances and this and that whereas Newport we didn't know many people

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:33.780
we had lots of people from Jamaica but you know the islands that even though a lot of the things

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:39.300
we do the same but we're still this thing at the beginning I thought oh it's a little small island

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.860
small island they didn't and sometimes I thought it was a little bit derogatory

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:50.180
you know we had the same thing but it was always this small island people so

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:58.260
so it was just another family the Comptons and my aunt and I think Marion

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:06.100
about three or four other families from St. Lucia. So you always wanted to do nursing? Yes I wanted

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:13.540
to do teaching or nursing and you know very young they take you into the teaching profession there

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.540
and you're teaching and while you're teaching you're going to one college or

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:23.300
teachers college or after that you can just expand and you know there's a limit of how you can go

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:34.420
and then I always liked nursing I wanted to do nursing and I was a little bit young to go in and

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:40.660
when I sat the exam they said you know in the next 18 months or something I can come but then

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:47.780
after a while when my aunt was here she encouraged my mother so send her over you know she can do it

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:52.740
over here blah blah yeah people said oh you do it in England the certificate is good and you can

00:19:52.740 --> 00:20:02.180
travel you can go anywhere so um I thought oh I'll come over here instead. And your boyfriend was

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:07.700
already here at the time? Yes. What were you expecting before you came? What did you think?

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:14.260
I just thought it was an adventure I just sort of somehow I'm coming to Loon and whatever but um

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:24.420
I don't know you know I just stand by the sea and see all this this this the sea and the sky meeting

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:30.580
and that's and I wonder what's behind that you know and um you know when people ask me I just

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:36.420
would ask them if I didn't think a little bit apprehensive because I thought I'm leaving friends

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:40.900
I'm leaving friends you know but lots of my friends had come over here as well any of their

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:46.180
mothers were they sent to them more and those were teenagers come over and I just thought I'm

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:50.580
coming over I'm watching the nurse and I'm you know looking forward to all of that so um. Was it

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:57.860
hard leaving your mum? It was hard leaving families you know crying and you know it was very hard

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:05.540
but I think when we're young yes you think it's so sad and it's so hard and leaving said Gloucester

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:10.660
you had all this carefree life you know and you went to church on Sundays you didn't have a big

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:28.740
coat on you so um yeah it was hard but at the same time I thought I'm coming over my brothers

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:35.060
here my sister here so I had this nuclear family yes so I didn't think twice I just asked them

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:43.860
Do you remember the journey? Yes I had on this big ship and I mean I was young and this lady said

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:50.340
to me I think she came home and she said oh I got Margaret I forgot her brother's name the two were

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:54.980
coming over couple years young and we could have been nice to look after them because they

00:21:54.980 --> 00:22:02.660
were my dad. How old were you? I was just over 17 years old and their mum and dad were over here

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:06.420
so it wasn't unusual just as a problem happened now because wasn't it usual

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:12.820
you were coming over then a child of four or five you know they'd give it to auntie to say bring

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:16.740
and she'd have the child on her passport so that's why a lot of the problem happened because

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:20.740
you're still and somebody might have gone to live in Boomin and whatever when your passport gone

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:24.980
so you don't know where just you know although they are disembarked on cars I don't know if it's

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:30.340
right there but anyhow so Margaret and her brother so we shared the same cabin because her brother

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:39.780
might have been Lemo 12 and a couple of the young ladies from St Lucia so it was fine you know got

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:46.500
dressed you know our dress was made got dressed and come up and I had coats sent for me by my aunt

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:54.100
and this and you know and that's all enjoy yourself we stopped in Tether Reef walked around there

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:59.780
got to Barcelona I and somebody sort of take charge I don't know he was from St Lucia and you

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:04.100
know people always say oh all of you all stay together and that because the ship had everybody

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:13.460
you know from the islands Grenada and then from Barcelona I thought I thought you went under the

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:20.580
Alps after a lot of over here we did try the Alps but I didn't know under the Alps then to um

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:26.820
France to Calais Calais to Dover Dover to Waterloo Waterloo to Paddington

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:33.940
and then my aunt was my aunt husband was waiting and um

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:47.060
Peter so um yeah so there we are so what was the first impression when you stepped off my first

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:52.660
impression I thought the train took so long how far we got to go because then we had this

00:23:52.660 --> 00:24:00.820
coal-fired train probably take maybe three hours I think we left late the night I think I got to

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:05.780
me but early hours of the morning and then I saw these houses I thought was one big house

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:09.940
so there's one big house people living in you know the terrace houses all the chains what is

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:20.420
chain is for you know and and then two days after we decided we're going out it was not my aunt

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:27.860
it was um one of the ladies from St Lucia we call her Auntie Auntie men do you want me to put there

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:39.220
no I don't and um Auntie man said come on why not because I was my nickname come on we're going

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:44.980
now we're going to the shop so there is me I remember having a polka dot long waisted dress

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:51.380
had nice lace around there lace around there and just a little cardigan and a little bag and

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:57.060
said come on you know we're going out I was crying at a bus stop is how to school you didn't tell

00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:03.540
us call after I've caught he said oh I thought you would feel the cold so that was cool and we

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:09.220
went around town at Marks and Spencer looking at stuff and all that and then as a first first

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:20.340
of the coal and me because it was still cold in April so um so you came in April yeah okay geez

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:23.620
is

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:42.580
so you were here um you had family here which was good and you had Peter here as well um and then

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:48.500
did you start immediately going into nursing or no what I did I went to look for a job as a secretary

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:57.700
and going to this place um they said the job was then everyone when I got there I think was some

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:03.700
little counter thing and they peeped and they said oh there was no job then do you want some water

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:09.700
I'm okay but you might I've got some water thank you

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:09.940
yeah

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:20.420
and um that was my first little thing of um racism tell me oh she said a big smile

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:30.660
oh no no no we haven't got any jobs there so um that was it then and

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:31.960
and

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:39.220
what did I do there was a factory and so I worked a few hours there

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:46.500
and I was terrible what kind of work did you have to do it was dreadfully I think it was doing nails

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:52.900
and that sort of thing and you have to pack stuff and I thought that's not for me so I worked part

00:26:52.900 --> 00:27:01.780
time in often was a tb hospital then but I think they changed it in cafe marbly just as a

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:10.900
observer you know um sort of going into nursing looking at that and then after I worked um

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:16.900
for a couple months before I went into this anyhow the new sin thing was they wanted me to

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:24.180
sit exam again so when I applied and I told her you know I done this and oh I don't know if you

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:28.820
could do the exam because what happened a lot of nurses were coming they were recruiting them from

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:34.420
home I think a lot from barbed us as well barbadoz June and recruiting them from home and they were

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:39.300
coming straight to the different hospitals with yorkshire newport wherever but I didn't come on

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:43.940
that scheme then I decided to do my thing and she said I don't know if you sit here I don't know if

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:49.620
you pass the exam so I thought you know there again because they recruit oh you've got to be

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:55.460
sent by your own government or something but I said I've come here I'm invited have you come here

00:27:55.460 --> 00:28:01.780
I didn't have to be sent by my government so I sat the exam and then I got into nursing she said

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:09.540
I thought I should be allowed to see today that tutor so there's my nursing career started

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:17.060
and that was my fault as a problem as well as on the streets with racism and discrimination

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:23.060
people calling your names and then so tell me more about the experience on the streets and

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:28.900
experience well it come to your face you know black this or black that go home you don't want

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:35.140
you here or as you invited sometimes you don't get noticed sometimes you call you know you just

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:42.020
look at them and then you'd see them looking for that curtain window you know if you're passing by

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:50.100
it was Auntie men no she was jesus said because you watch so um and that's what you had and you

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:55.620
think why did I I wanted to go back after I thought well cold hair although it was the

00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:01.140
the spring then you have people not accepting

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:08.580
you then they'd be asking a question which I thought was stupid like what oh why did you

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:16.100
do your english what house did you live in houses did you live in trees if I wanted to be funny I

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:22.100
say I lived in trees I don't know what houses are like here isn't it good I learned english hey

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:26.900
you know in a couple months I am I learned the english isn't it good look at me

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:36.580
so you know I will give them the answer and you know you'll be traveling on the bus

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:40.500
and you know they didn't want to see me the bus fall they didn't want to sit by you

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:44.500
because um you're not one of them

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:52.180
um and you know you go to the shops I think I wrote something like that sometime I was giving

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:58.260
a talk ages ago and you try and give them money they they wouldn't want your hand to touch them

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.940
they want the money though yeah the money drop and then they'd see you standing there but

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:07.780
you know they'd be looking at somebody come after white person come after and then ask them what they

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:14.180
want and you know that sort of thing I had to face so whatever opportunity I had I'd be going

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:19.940
to London I didn't want to live in London but I'd be going to London weekends and you'd end up in

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:26.100
Brixton market on the Harrow Road in Paddington and it was back in the Caribbean because wherever

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:33.540
you walk you see black faces you know um in Brixton I mean it was mostly Caribbean people then you

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:39.540
know from Jamaica from Trinidad St Lucia you name it the same so Harrow Road would meet a lot of

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:44.580
people from St Lucia as well being from the villages what and you know it's patois patois

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:50.500
they speak in there everybody's meeting Creole you know they greet you in Creole first and then

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:58.420
you know start the English or then into Creole again so then you go to weddings and christianings

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:02.580
there's always something happening down there what was the greeting let me hear it

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:08.260
it's a cafe it's a cafe it's a cafe bonjour all right in westam Wales

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.940
eh it's a country you live in you know

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:24.020
west of London nah so um Peter had a very good friend there and we go to his place my sister was

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:27.380
there go to her then she'd take me around people that I know you know let's go and visit this one

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:31.540
let's go and see this one you know so it was you know you really liked it because

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:35.860
they had a real Creole being spoken a lot of people there was from a village kind of

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:43.380
reusable most of them were light skinned you know some had blue eyes and then he spoke Creole because

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:50.180
in castries those spoke Creole and English but from around the coast in the other villages a lot

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:55.700
of them spoke Creole first English after so you had a Creole going on and the Dominicans would meet

00:31:56.340 --> 00:32:02.020
a little bit different same and so you meet all these people you know and then you'd hear the

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.780
Creole band because I think one day I don't know what happened with Estonia laundry at the first

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:11.860
year something of somebody there you know and I said oh I said there's no need for all of that

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:17.300
the woman said to me you come from where you come from you um you don't know anything about

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:21.620
St Lucian so I said to her

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:33.940
so um yeah so it was nice going then then after all that St Lucian dances Trinidad and Tobago

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:39.380
dances I used to go to that you know and um then you'd meet you know sort of there's people I

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:44.980
didn't see for years and I met them at I think it was a Trinidad dance we went and I met them there

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:50.500
and surely when I call her cousin she's with him then she'd tell me if it was going on then we'd

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:56.660
have a carnival session we'd meet up a whole gang of us I'd go to my brother in Brent

00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:05.300
we'd cook something then we should leave the car we walk up from um this chickenham road and then

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:10.420
we'd go to the carnival and we had a spot where we all stood and if one went somewhere somebody

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:15.300
stayed there we all meet up together and we would jump up and buy food and buy this and that and

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:20.260
eat and then all midnight she was living in Kent so sometimes I'd stay at her place because oh come

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:27.300
come we all live together actually my cousin was my aunt was very religious then very religious

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:33.140
joined the Jehovah's Witness but I think it was because she felt a sense of belonging there because

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:39.300
my aunt is spat in her face you know on the bus and she came there so I think this was a sense of

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:49.060
belonging and um Auntie Men was the same you know and they sort of joined the two of them joined

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:56.580
the Jehovah's Witness but you tried again but you joined I wouldn't oh my last you know you

00:33:56.580 --> 00:34:02.580
wouldn't go to heaven I said what aunt I don't want to go to heaven anyhow so oh there are lessons

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:09.140
you have people to come and give me lessons both of us I said anyhow I said I can't believe in

00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:13.780
some of the things you're saying because I've seen blood save people and you don't believe in

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:21.220
blood transfusion and all that business and no birthdays because when I had my sons it was

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:26.340
a celebration of different gifts for them you know because my aunt didn't believe in birthdays

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:32.660
not Christmas I didn't believe in Christmas so you just as do no Christmas thing you know

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:41.220
because um because I lived with her for a while and then imagine Christmas come come from the

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:48.180
caravan and she's so religious you know very very but I think she turned that way because

00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:58.980
of the discrimination she faced so um yeah and then my journey into nursing I had the boys in

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:06.100
between you know going to the nursing I had um Trevor Nigel a couple years in between them

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:16.660
how old were you um when you had your first I was 22 okay and then had Trevor Nigel and Mark so

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:27.460
in between that during um nursing as well so then I carried on with my nursing career as well as

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:32.820
week nights when the children were small so I'll be there in the day you know all the sort of things

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:41.700
I had a week having them and um on holidays I'd ask could I do um some people be a month for nights

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:44.980
or six weeks like can I do your six weeks and I do my month as well

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:51.700
and um so somebody would be there because Peter would shifts and someone would be there to help

00:35:51.700 --> 00:36:00.100
them you know so it was hard very hard then at the beginning I didn't want to stay

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:07.140
I wanted to go back I thought I can't be staying here I'd be caught it's cold you can't go to the

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:13.460
beaches you want the church if you didn't although you went to Church of England we're

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:17.700
Church of England people but then you got up in the morning it was nice and bright so you were

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:23.700
sat 10 o'clock then you went to evening mass then you went Sunday school but it was so different

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:29.540
hey you know I think they still had the same I went to the Anglican church when I lived a little

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:35.460
further down from here at one time and there are people asking where did you learn the hymns

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:42.020
I thought I do belong to the Anglican church the bishop then was nice try to you know and

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:46.980
when the nuns knew Peter was Roman Catholic then a couple nuns came home and said oh we have to

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:56.340
question the church so um yeah so my experience in the beginning now I just wanted to go home and I

00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:02.420
thought my goodness me you're supposed to be well educated people but little did I know our problem

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:09.300
was more educated than some of them you know and all the things you see all these people smell or

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:15.300
something and I think first thing I'd see on the bus I thought we have to do that the girls have

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:22.580
their makeup spit on their hand and then when they're chewing through their dumb yoke put it in their mouth

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:26.660
and then the mother's put it in their mouth they just wipe it up and give it to them

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:33.060
I thought no as well as we are you know we washed you know the morning we had to soap and

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:38.260
water you know clean you and then I think oh well there we are

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:47.140
there we are you know iron your clothes and looking good and I thought I couldn't get just

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:54.180
a big courtyard wear everywhere until that little window we had in the summer but um I still thought

00:37:54.180 --> 00:38:01.140
oh I love um sewing and auntie used to sew but other auntie men used to sew better so I'd go to

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.580
her and say you make this dress for me you do that for me that dress you made an auntie when she

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:10.260
passed away two years ago what a material it had lovely red roses and I know I'll come back and um

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:16.020
auntie made me that dress for me she said you were my little model because I must have been a size

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:22.900
eight then and anything I say oh well that's what the Marks and Spinsby kind of styles

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:26.900
and then she'd come back and you know these people home they've not had pattern cuts

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:32.980
you know and she'd make these dresses covered buttons and we go to London I say oh I like this

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:37.940
and we go to a shop at a raft to buy all the material I wanted this we say oh you better come

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:41.620
and for me to be chatting if we say oh you better come and wait for it and then we go

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:46.740
sure I'll just go it here so that's the hand to take home to do it here and then she'd show me how

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:51.780
to cut on the bias and do this so I bought a sewing machine and I was well aware me pants with the

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:57.620
boys trousers yes there's so a lot and you know because you couldn't afford it with the trim

00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:02.660
having things like that oh everybody had something new and you know we'd buy good

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:08.900
shippers by all the material and come back was cheap there and lovely material and I'd auntie

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:13.540
meant sew she said I'll cut for you go and sew it Vanessa and then show me how to knit her

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:18.100
knit booties and lovely things for the boys you know until they say we don't anything they did again

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:25.540
you know jumpers and cardigans I think I needed market to trousers and a little top to go if

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:35.780
needed top and lots of stuff so always kept busy and baking sweet bread for them and cakes and

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:39.140
then all their friends would come there when they went to school you find a house full of men

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:45.380
full of men and when they went into music I come there with somebody with

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:53.300
their saxophone there somebody with this then I could plug into light something then I do in

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:58.660
the middle of the passage and add some new carpet and then I just brought to keep something something

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:05.060
on the drum into the carpet it's the middle of the I come home and I bake a lovely cake

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:10.580
piece for me and the French would read it all even now the boys said we should have toast

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:22.900
so um yeah they they bring their white friends here friends here no bother you know I'd rather

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:29.300
see your friends here then I don't know where you are so they come I bought a new shed once and who

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:36.660
had it they were all the drums and their music in it you know and but um you know they were

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:40.900
quite free I think I was quite liberalized and they were free to do their thing you know

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:48.020
and bring their friends so it sounds like you know you talk about your aunts and how they

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:53.460
used religion to kind of connect to find a sense of belonging and you had going back and forth to

00:40:53.460 --> 00:41:00.180
London and here in Creole and then you had the craft you had your you know yeah I done baking I

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:05.540
used to try and do ice on the cakes for Christmas and I used to get these little silver balls put on

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:10.420
and they could say and I know Marco but they're taking out a little bit of the silver balls on

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:15.940
yeah I tried everything you know um you know bacon I don't do a lot now because it's too fat

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:22.420
but I used to bake bread I used to love baking bread for the if all the bread is baked I mean

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:34.180
should see them make rolls and make rock cake we call it and yeah so I think for me I made

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:42.500
I found things to do to cushion the way I was treated you know if I didn't do things like that

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:48.100
I think I'd be dwelling on oh really treating because I think some people sang some people

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:52.980
had mental problem because when you went to hospital you couldn't explain themselves you'd

00:41:52.980 --> 00:42:01.380
see it you know then the NHS was one of the most racist place to work at one time you know um

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:07.940
promotion as you'd hear lots of people telling the police in the NHS in these big organizations

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.940
it you know they didn't think you should be promoted you should be either clean or staying

00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:18.020
down where you are and you still have people in in the lati years working with stinky work

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:22.740
because I didn't wait even four months to work sirvi and think he was a cleaner that passed me

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:30.180
by and going the office to the clerical staff you know in my boss the ones and I think she was

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:34.740
taking everybody to something and this one said are you going venice I say no it's quite neat

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:41.140
I said um I know I'm a blonde and I have a bob but they got black barbies as well you know so

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:48.980
I said well because you know I'm responsible for ABC and then this person is going if you're not

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:53.060
and I'm asking to go oh oh I didn't think she'd know what to say I say well there are black

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:59.140
barbies I know you're the barbies blonde barbies because she was not happy at all and I travel

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:05.460
come to linden with me to draw a college of midwife but you still you know you you sit

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:15.380
and sometimes you could say oh well let's see one of us I said how can I be I say yes I do the same

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:21.460
job as you do but not one of us you know because if somebody comes for an interview interview no

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:25.220
I can't explain this out why you think you can't explain you speak a couple languages

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:30.740
no so I said you always think in the language first before they answer you

00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:37.540
I say you probably say that no no no I'm not one of you you know look at me

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:46.900
so but I think doing things and getting apart from working apart from doing these other things

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:53.300
hard at the you know stuff doing so um it cushioned a lot of the blows I think

00:43:54.180 --> 00:44:02.100
facing the discrimination racism yeah and you had a good base as a child yes yes that good solid

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:09.140
upbringing because um the friday when I went to the thing in newport and my daughter and she said

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:17.140
I said what made you into what you I said I think racism and discrimination made me into a person I

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:22.980
am shaped to me but I said growing up I had strong people around me and I said a village the community

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:32.500
you know they were urging you on and I said you met people from abroad and you had everybody around

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:36.660
me work they'd done something you know we didn't just sit and you think we were just everybody was

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:41.860
these wonderful people who saw it and in the holiday time I was just going to help miss whatever

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:45.940
you know to do the hems refer go and help whatever if you have to buy the buttons go and buy the

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:51.540
buttons in the shop or what no so you had wonderful people and strong people who shaped you

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:56.180
you know said to you I remember my aunt's one of my aunt's saying to me

00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:01.540
don't go and miss your time when you go over there you know but let's do something don't miss your time

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:05.460
over there and do something and I said to people I was just people around I said

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:12.340
you know because thinking of that long journey and all the problems I face you know

00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:17.940
let's say persecution they finished beating up you know people laugh I say I got battered and

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:24.660
bruised I said and to come out on this end and you can give younger people the experience because

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:31.460
you had nobody there for you you had to make your decisions and you said which way you go

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:35.460
you know how am I going to handle this because you had no restoration laws then

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:41.860
and even you had that when it came in it didn't do much because when it's got around it is only now

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:47.620
that you can make a person you can say yes and it can go as far as it can go with the screw nature

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:54.100
but you know people say what they want to you and it's only a joke you know and I said I don't joke

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:59.620
if you like I don't want to my plaits in my head now if I see they have their head and I say God

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:06.100
you have a lovely style today oh oh God we don't know what color you're coming to today but I've

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:10.020
never ever gone and touched the hair and see and then they come and touch us at the meeting once

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:15.540
and I have one f-year so why are you doing it I said I don't ever touch your hair why are you

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:22.020
doing it you're not supposed to do that don't ever do it I was so cross at the meeting I said don't

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:27.940
do it I don't do it to you have I ever touched your hair I will comment I'll say oh your style

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:31.860
is really nice today oh they'll ask me I say oh it suits you whether it is not

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:39.140
but I say why do you want to touch my if I went around my you're not yourself and I said I don't

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:44.020
know my end plaits I said my hair was plaited when I was growing up so what's the big deal about

00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:53.300
remember I have my hair colored a bronzy color going to the maid said to me oh what was your color

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:56.340
before I said Mrs. James you see me all the time what color was I

00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:06.820
I thought you know what then Mark my son was in the cricket thing he's the only black boy

00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:12.180
who's in the cricket team in his school so I had a picture I took him to work and had it showing

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:19.860
how you know oh which one is yours ah I said Mrs. James there he is a black boy there

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:35.700
so in the end you call him Caribbean queen and boy where's the Caribbean queen yeah it seems

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:42.980
like you carry a sense of pride with yes where's the Caribbean queen I thought oh so whenever they

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:50.180
said oh there's the Caribbean queen yeah I say I'm a queen to you all did you struggle with that

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:58.500
idea of Britishness yes growing up well as you know in the islands you had to learn everything

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:06.980
British in it Kipling's thing Oliver Twist the charge of the light brigade

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:15.780
Shakespeare Milton you name it we had to learn all of that and we actually cite things as well

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:20.020
and you got to learn all the songs I'm going to screen birthday and you're going to square

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:24.580
your flag and sing you know god bless our queen Elizabeth and blah blah blah you know

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:30.820
and then you salute the flag before you started that's what I was saying to the school children

00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:37.460
I said what's the family like now we say this and that and you salute the flag you say your

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:43.220
hymn you say prayers and there you are school starts during the week you go to church so

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:49.700
I said you know a sense of Britishness when you came but after you treat me you say well

00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:56.340
why are we really British then because you had to do everything that was done here

00:48:57.540 --> 00:49:04.660
and then you came here you were invited to come here you know people there was one village I

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:10.420
thought there was nobody left people just come and you know and and um

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:16.740
and um next thing you come here and you were treated with hostility

00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:24.500
you mean your work your work colleague you know um they didn't treat you nice I remember starting

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:32.260

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:22.980
interview I said no I can't come and go into the dentist where's your dentist so I hesitated I said

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:30.020
oh it's down the hill there you know care request and da da da I should I come and collect you then

00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:34.580
ask the dentist what time you going no it's all right I don't want to go out so I don't collect you

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:40.180
so she did you know she come and collect me I had an interview there

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:48.660
it was the hospital secretary it was her and it was um one of the gps senior gps because it was

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:56.660
a gp unit run by midwife with a consultant to do a clinic once a week there so he said I'll be the

00:50:56.660 --> 00:51:00.580
making of you Vanessa you're wrong just big hospital doctors I said that's what you're seeing but I

00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:03.140
don't know if I like it I don't know if I like I probably leave you know

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:08.820
but that was the beginning of me I had so much experience you know think for myself because in

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:13.300
the going then you have to go through this and go through that and it was you making a lot of

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:18.420
decisions because the gp is not stationed there the consultant comes once a week and when he did

00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:25.300
come and I did a clinic and just do the wheel the blood pressure so do you part Peter oh

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:30.500
oh I thought you were going to know you part tell me if you think you have anything wrong

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:38.020
they just tell me yes so I thought oh so that was the making of me the experience I had you know and

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:41.300
miss Morgan would come see us so yeah

00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:48.980
and then I faced hostility to divide Clark she wouldn't give me my pay slip oh I have to go

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:53.460
through stories of you showing me my pay slip because she was banging the middle there you are

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:58.100
the words are there you have an office then office then she could see everything and she was really

00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:04.260
hostile so sometimes you'd have a pay slip two days before payday they'd send it down and you'd

00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:08.660
have it in the grant but they sent up to and she'd have it there and I went for my piece if I was

00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:14.740
used to that no you're not getting until a day no mrs price I worked from I want my piece

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:21.620
so when I run I rang them in the office don't I said am I supposed to have my pay slip one day

00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:25.460
because you sent some no I said you can have it it's been up there how many days you can have

00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:30.980
your piece well I want to so evil and she come to my face I said if you come any more to my face

00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:36.260
well we had this nice staircase very white you know these big houses why I said I threw it up

00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:45.220
the stairs so this white midwife went to unseemly surprise just leave her alone well alone she slapped

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:48.420
the girl I think she wanted to slap she did she slapped her in the face

00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:57.860
so I thought I said you wanted to do that too but if you'd ever touch me just right should be down

00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:06.020
that stairs so um I told my boss mrs james was there mrs james didn't do anything she was quiet

00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:12.020
you know that's why mrs price took advantage and then I thought days nothing had been said so I saw

00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:17.380
miss morgan the top major and I told her shit about it you didn't say anything I come up here

00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:22.820
I said no I expected mr james to tell you and right because she brought all the hospitals

00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:28.500
sectorial and you see because of delay union this and that but we move in at her office will

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:36.180
not be there she'll be going right around the back for office and um when they ask um the young lady

00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:41.380
because she was a christian she said you turn the other cheek say mrs price yes she hit the girl on

00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:50.660
face you know what I think she wanted but as it is when we close at Lydia she found herself working

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:56.500
somewhere in the back of pharmacy so she had nobody to think then she was a lonely old soul

00:53:56.500 --> 00:54:04.100
working there and I went to something I met her son-in-law and he was telling me about it was he

00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:09.860
was a counselor and he's saying about this mother-in-law mrs price oh if you worked in the

00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:16.340
religion and you would admit I said oh yes very good encounter I said and I left that that

00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:18.660
she always said you wouldn't have that's a very good encounter

00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:26.820
but you faced it everywhere even with a sister I worked with and she was about to retire

00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:34.180
you know I come up all enthusiastic and it was really weak in two days but

00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:38.660
she used to come up and check what I'm doing and I said you know what

00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:45.540
you can look after that you you go on you go and go and do my thing you know

00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:51.700
when I'm like crazy ways and telling them but you face it sometimes they do it and they didn't think

00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:58.740
you know face it and sometimes you would see what they're doing and then you retaliate or

00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:05.060
at times I'd come home because when I had the manager's role looking after the general

00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:10.180
practitioner unit down here and another couple of the union people I work with

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:16.260
when I was promoted and that was just giving me a promotion because I had to go through the mill

00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:21.700
and they had to ask a chief case about me the new lady took over and people I worked with over the

00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:29.700
years oh why she had that rule why she managed because I had to manage them so my boss said you

00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:37.220
know what Esther you come yesterday and you've got where you are and they've been there before

00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:46.420
you haven't got anywhere and they made my life hell it wasn't easy somebody belonged to the Royal

00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:54.180
College of Midwives and she was supposed to be a steward oh well so your grade will be this and

00:55:54.180 --> 00:56:01.300
this I say well you can take it away from me if you can you can do it no big deal I say no your

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:06.420
problem this that's the problem I sound like a problem with you all but this is your problem

00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:13.300
it's too good for me to be a manager is it but fair play message written was very very good

00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:18.740
you know and they went to see Eliza reporting she was horrible to start all sorts of things and then

00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:24.900
she said to me don't go out I want you to come down after so why this lady was this in all of

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:31.300
nonsense she asked me so that's why I'm concerned she said every gp I speak to in Newport they've

00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:38.020
got a lot of time for sister Cyril and as far as her stuff is concerned I haven't heard anything

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:46.660
from the staff so summing it up they said would you like her to move elsewhere but I still know I said

00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:52.020
as long as you realize I'm in charge and I said there's a saying two male crabs don't live in the

00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:59.780
same hole and I said somebody's got to be in charge and as long as you realize that but I said every

00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:03.940
time they up to the nonsense they come to your side and that and I moved them obviously I'm weak

00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:13.140
no I said I'll work with them so but you know what I had to go into two units I had to join

00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:19.780
because unison if they have to deal the case they work in with the firm they get somebody

00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:24.900
that's not with the firm from Cardiff or London and I was in the college as well purposely for

00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:34.660
my practice or if I did my practice touchwood and so then I have to join two unions because I felt

00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:41.700
the way they were going people who were looking at you so and then I encouraged them one of my

00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:47.860
colleagues was from Guyana Indian Guyanese and she wasn't treated very nice somebody reported her and

00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:54.500
I said Jami where are you from why do you have to so many times do this and they'd see her being

00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:59.700
struck off so when that new boss came I said there's a problem with Jami she again get get

00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:05.780
the notes let me have a look and this sister was a sister as well but she hated black people

00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:11.780
and I said Jami if the doctor had continuous monitor why did you let her tell you take off

00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:17.620
the monitor and take her to the watch the baby died and the mother said I will see up uniform

00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:25.380
off I said why do you like Greta Cotellian anyhow Mrs Drayton Feckley was good the she had five

00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:32.180
cases against her by you know foreign doctor orders and liver and and um but she could keep her job as

00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:37.780
long as in five years nothing comes up against and then they moved Greta the one who told her

00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:45.060
was senior to her and said we'll do this to them and she was horrible to me as a midwife in training

00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:53.220
you do what you've been taught to do which is safe and I was delivering a placenta

00:58:53.300 --> 00:59:02.260
and she came in myself and my colleague pull it this way I said no that's not what I was taught

00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:11.060
so you've got to put your hands on the bottom of the uterus and then ease it comes out easily so

00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:16.100
I said I've been taught so I've done my thing what they taught me oh that's what it's going to be

00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:23.620
midwives me so a husband somebody's husband was there because then we had the husbands in

00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:34.900
and he said that's one puncher so I went to see my tutor told her about having shadowed another time

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:41.780
I I don't know month on nights because I was sort of a senior sister then so I didn't want that

00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:47.700
I was looking after a young lady and she had thalassemia but I wasn't happy with the fetal

00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:53.300
heart so I said to the assistant of me go on tell sisters was in the office to ring

00:59:54.100 --> 01:00:00.180
a doctor for me because I'm not happy oh she comes in and the sin dosimundrup but we're not

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:07.380
allowed to put sin dosimundrup on my eyes was bulging and I thought I said are we allowed to do that

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:12.260
oh well doctor's been up all night he said to me if I can do I thought if anything happened to this

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:19.620
woman my name is there on the notes I couldn't sleep in a day so I rang the office I said is

01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:25.860
it something I missed out are we allowed to put sin dosimundrup no greater than it well when I went

01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:30.020
into it the following night I called on your sister I wear blue and you wear blue you should

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:33.700
respect what I asked you to do because I would respect what you asked me to do if you asked me

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:38.980
to get a doctor I'd do it why are you doing it why did you do it to me my name if anything

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:44.580
happened to that baby I would be the one or to the mother oh well you know we see the doctors do it so

01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:49.060
then after they didn't like in the night I worked with them there were two of them Mrs.

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:54.180
Nicholas and her and the other sister didn't get one so I was in the middle now I was experienced

01:00:54.180 --> 01:01:00.260
to be on the shop for working they put into special a woman and he kept coming in to see if I was

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:09.220
asleep so I know what you're coming in for we were evil I guess what she decided 40 something she um

01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:16.500
wasn't married to a child or two that she had a baby and I was then a staff midwife on the

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:27.700
board she was coming to I said revenge is sweet no sweet well check her pillows let me put you right

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:32.660
are you all right I said you're ever so sweet

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:46.420
you're ever so sweet but after Jamie's case Mr. Dritten decided to shift them around so

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:51.940
guess where did she work I was a boss then come to work with me she couldn't take it

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:56.180
hmm she she had time off Mr.

01:01:56.180 --> 01:02:00.180
Jimmy she had time off sick was a colleague sick I moved down with me tell her you want to work

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:06.020
with me said no you're going to work with Vanessa upstairs because that was a punishment for her for

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:12.500
telling the midwife take the one of the monitor Jamie had a punishment as well I think this was

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:18.740
might have been the severest because she listened to it take the woman off the monitor and Greta had

01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:27.380
for not well I thought revenge is so sweet so just thought a turnaround as a student by the way she

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:34.660
treated me so I looked after her so I need to clean it because I still do the clinics now since

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:38.100
she didn't like she still she drinks really she's still how many minutes she going to work at

01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:42.580
and she's going to finish up there oh she said well it's a nice finesse there because she wanted

01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:50.500
to go and see her husband was buried around which she said and um I said well after her love

01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:54.980
and she went with priests and everything went in the night and then he was the right way around but

01:02:54.980 --> 01:03:02.260
she couldn't cope with coming to me I'm her boss well goodness me and then in the end guess who her

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:03.940
daughter actually

01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:14.500
her wife is locks wow and she came to my ward when she had a baby and her mother came

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:20.340
so let's get I come in non-visiting touch I said fine Greta and I went in her for oh I said I went

01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:26.580
to see the baby oh what a lovely baby gosh do that nice complexion

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:41.860
the girls were saying oh you're awful jammies minister you awful he said no and I thought you

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:46.980
know you do things and sometimes it comes back to haunt you but I was nasty I was quite nice which I

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:53.140
looked after quite well and I thought the same thing you did you couldn't stand me and she was

01:03:53.140 --> 01:04:03.860
a refugee from the war from oh some of us were a refugee because her name was KUICK

01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:12.100
and um I know there you are but the girls some girls wouldn't work your foot and go home they'll

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:19.540
come the night and she's on their goal and what others would undermine me I said I'm more happy

01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:24.740
this when I was on the baby I said oh nothing wrong with it and the one day I walk off and I

01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:30.980
just walk off the ward so I'm coming back and she come here she had so many trips oh I said I don't

01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:38.260
know I said you're too rude but these were the things you had to face with and I don't know why

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:42.100
I got the strength when I think back I said you know how I managed how I stayed oh I didn't go

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:47.220
mental I got the strength to come home and I used to come home and think of my own strategies

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:56.980
how do I handle them and if I had to cry cry home I wouldn't show them and there was another incident

01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:02.820
and they were quite horrible this sister wanted Christmas time off I say

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:10.180
you got a new Christmas day you had Christmas Eve off oh and she created I don't know what the

01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:17.380
patients are so I didn't say anything till I walk away and our boss says to do some social psychology

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:24.580
or something as senior people and the woman said to me something they said and I said I was sort

01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:29.220
of a weakness when I walk away from no she said it's quite a good strength she said because you

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:32.980
will retaliate and then you have to say sorry because you might just go for it

01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:38.980
and then I remember I didn't say anything because she kept on patients with her and stuff was you

01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:46.100
know god how horrible she is and so I came back I don't know if it's a couple days after she came

01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:50.820
into it and I watched her go in the office and I went in the office and I stood behind her I said

your genius stuff sometimes I'd be for a day go for a day off and then you'd go to my colleague

01:06:56.340 --> 01:07:01.940
and say you think I can have a day off tomorrow because um she said well Vanessa was there so

01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:07.060
Jenny'd say to me oh she come and ask me I said no Vanessa is coming back you can ask and then I

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:13.460
said well I know I'm black but I'm not invincible oh oh oh and there's a magic shit I said yeah I'm

01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:20.980
black but to some of you I'm invincible sorry invisible and um I'm here so why you go to

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:29.620
Jenny and ask I said so in the fainting more than one for but but that was your mechanism coping

01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:36.420
sometimes telling them you know and I said I'll come and we'll see I look and then you had students

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:41.460
midwives coming up another time you wanted me to keep a particular side for med students and

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:46.820
student midwives to come and have experience so I didn't at all no delivering at any late

01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:54.660
board in the wards because you are 12 bed and I came back the next day this one moved that back

01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:59.380
and they tell all the gps owners want to do this and that so one of the gps said I don't think you

01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:05.780
have to take orders as well and it does you all have to take orders so another one came in and

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:10.900
I said why didn't you bring me first doctor said I'm not really whatever listening to them

01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:17.460
and then ask a student with I say I'm doing some statistics I said this is your job for the week

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:23.620
keep up to date if who's transferring do this and she said you're not telling me she gets paid for

01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:29.700
that I said you're a student midwife you want um a report from me I've got to write a report

01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:36.420
and I said oh that's what she said is it I said what pay do I get more from you if you're work

01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:42.340
weekends you're more pay so um I said sue just kind of say no I told her I'm doing it you know

01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:50.340
that was the thing drugs taken they wanted something was missing and they probably write

01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:54.900
little letters to each other and somebody intercepted and said Vanessa guess what there's

01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:59.620
what I'm not missing and this one said oh we'll get into trouble I said all of you are coming

01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:06.180
down with me so my union then I ran and then you investigated and she said when I still

01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:13.300
don't have senior people who can infer for them to make sure they counted drugs for me but these

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:20.980
were the tricks and all the things I used to do and then you managed to get to the top to get the

01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:27.860
award the midwife of the what was it midwife of the year and obi and when I had the obi I was

01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:34.660
weakened and I was working a weekend and I went in and said to the staff because I was in charge

01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:41.140
of the whole unit I don't know if I should I don't know if it's good or if it's bad but I was awarded

01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:49.460
an obi oh Vanessa obi canobi so that's a big joke so then I left it at that and then the world kept

01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:53.060
running where's Vanessa because he must have gone to the canteen and somebody said what's that

01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:59.380
midwife of the what you'll be also she was too you had this son of their flowers and oh Vanessa

01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:03.700
we thought was just the way you said it we thought you know you weren't serious we thought it was

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:11.620
just something and um flowers and you know the boss kept a party for me you know um invited

01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:21.780
I'm singing all these people I've done with risk and equality and yeah so I just I still ask I

01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:27.700
still I went to somebody I thought she may have been the one instigated I said who is it to you

01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:35.140
no said your sector was asking a lot of questions one time and I forgot that was a year before a

01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:42.500
year before that no she said things have to go to the bosses and to tell them and um you know

01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:48.820
Vanessa you know you're special special in what I said in my job thing so no you are special I've

01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:53.940
watched you and I've watched you some of the people coming from other countries and how you go and

01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:58.900
make them feel comfortable and I was like I was like a god for the Somali ladies down there because

01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:06.420
you know they wouldn't speak English and remember one she had to have a section of consultancy I'm

01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:11.460
not going to touch on tape if I can get somebody and I was really wrong and this midwife said well

01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:17.780
I told her I said you can't do that you have to get somebody to interpret so I think I got one of

01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:22.660
the registrars he's Egyptian and his I said you're not supposed to do it because it's not your job

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:27.380
but I said by the time you get a few tell others that I said is he going to do it for me Sam

01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:31.780
yeah he said he can speak better Arabic than me and then I got a consultant was going to operate

01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:38.180
on it fine I said thank you Sam um and because you're not supposed to get doctors to interpret

01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:43.540
or whatever I mean sometimes a consultant Jewish sex was happy and if there was somebody sick

01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:49.140
because a lot of them were coming over I said you speak I swear you better come over tell me

01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:56.900
get an interpreter whatever and she'd do it um so that was the things you know I mean I never saw

01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:02.100
anybody coming from a different place it doesn't matter whether poor white whatever I looked after

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:07.620
them just as I looked after anyone I supported the girls wanted to do stuff you know you can do it

01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:11.220
let me tell you what to write down you know if I envy you they're supportive papers and then they

01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:15.060
were doing this thing well I can't do it but I said I said what have you been doing with me all the

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:18.340
time you've been helping me you've been coming to tell me the woman is bleeding you're telling

01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:22.980
the baby is doing what you can put mothers I said you've got vast experience let's go through it you

01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:28.740
go and do it and the Philippine ladies they're wonderful a lot interviewing them and people say

01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:38.740
they speak English good I said they speak another language they're good so it was um it wasn't easy

01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:46.100
but I remember what I had to go through and every solvent can still go through it and I thought you

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:52.580
know no human being should be going through all these things in their life so the laws have changed

01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:57.460
now and the laws are a bit stronger for people now but they're still settling some areas

01:12:58.180 --> 01:13:04.900
and they think you can't suss them out you know and you suss them out on miles

01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:12.740
do you have any regrets about the journey so far I haven't got regrets it made me and into who I am

01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:20.340
and I think that I can impart a lot of things onto other people's growing up now because I think what

01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:27.620
it is now if people growing up they think they're born here they're going to ready think that oh

01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:34.660
I'm all right but you're not all right every sort of thing you come in some bigot who says something

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:40.020
to you or because at one time it was if your name was an African or whatever you wouldn't get an

01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:45.460
interview they wouldn't shortlist you whether you're a doctor or whatever and he didn't research in it

01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:51.620
and I went I was at a meeting of this chap he's now a doctor but he was a barrister and the two

01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:57.060
of them did research in St George's hospital and these people went to get with them

01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:05.460
they wouldn't give them and they went and for that he went into medicine and he was working in the

01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:12.980
east end of London the same way when I used to go to do before the Welsh assumed it was the Welsh

01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:17.060
office so I'd represent them to go to the department of health I was asked to go

01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:22.020
and you tell them the people coming from India whatever you know all you need is their property

01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:26.500
they haven't got that money to two thousand much pound to do it and you know why don't you allow

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:32.500
them to be on there for a few months we can do their prep encourage them to do it so um

01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:39.380
let's go for that meeting the UK USA the US people would come and they'd see what you have to offer

01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:44.420
them and you'd see what us have to offer them and it was quite exciting to them because I'll go to

01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:48.980
these big meetings and you're a professor what I'm all about I say oh you're a man-made wife

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:57.700
grassroots basically and this chap I call his name from her he was some professor in social

01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:03.220
something he said the grassroots people can teach us a lot you know and then I started off I forgot

01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:13.380
as you know I mean I got all this experience when I go all over the place when I decided to go into

01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:20.660
um recent quality I was the chair when he said to get rid of the equality thing they had in Newport

01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:28.260
because some of these men from the other continent they would be doing their own thing working under

01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:34.260
the auspices of that and his business they're carrying on so he scrapped and then he asked me

01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:39.380
do you think we should yes I said I said I'll have to I'm not doing it for money I said I'm

01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:47.060
working and then we had SREC which unfortunately last year it was sort of no funding coming in

01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:52.580
but with the head of the council if this and the other if all these people the chief of police

01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:58.900
will come to the meeting and then we had SREC and they hated me these men they hated me

01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:05.460
woman in the chair and the horn does in the council meeting that you know I'm little in that big

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:12.980
dress and what he said to me and said that woman see we get rid of her I said look Mr Babo I'm not

01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:17.780
there because I'm a black one for black people whether you're blue or black if you face

01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:22.500
discriminatory because you could face racism as white persons well and discriminatory

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:28.340
I'm there for everyone so one doctor said you're like the person in the in the southern states like

01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:37.220
one of the preachers but you had it from some quarters which some of them they don't understand

01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:43.300
people from the black community although as Muslims in Africa some of them did not like us as

01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:47.060
you know people from Africa you send as well I give them what's for

01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:54.900
so you had it all around for being a woman and for being Caribbean black Caribbean you know

01:16:55.460 --> 01:17:03.060
yeah and um it shaped me and it shaped me into being somebody who's strong and I mean after

01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:09.780
retired and I thought I'll chill out and get sort of a stroke I thought god of all the things you know

01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:14.500
I even in hospital I said I tried to write them a letter I went to see them and

01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:20.500
I'm the patient you were the consultant and he gave me some tablets said oh we'll follow you

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:24.580
up and see you now and I said is the nurse who's going to check my blood pressure oh she said well

01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:29.780
you're a doctor or whatever I didn't get better so I ran the consultant myself she said get down here

01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:35.460
um I've never seen a consultant tell off another consultant in front of me

01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:40.580
said why didn't find a bed why she said Vanessa I'll get you wherever I'll

01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:44.740
scramble get a bed for you to stay in and so I wrote a letter to the hospital

01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:50.500
right a friend was embarrassed I said come on and then invite me I said if Princess Anne came

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:57.380
through that door you'd go out of the way to make sure you know I'm a nobody and I'm a nobody and I

01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:03.380
come through that door I'm not to see with me you are looking after me now I'm a patient and I said

01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:08.500
I wasn't happy with he's telling me I'm all right he said I don't know the thing you're

01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:13.060
all right you're walking and this and the other but um Dr Freeman said he should have kept her

01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:17.620
in and just looked observe and whatever anyhow I don't know if the outcome would have been better

01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:23.380
as my friendship we stayed in the weekend when I said I really care so um and she they were nice

01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:30.420
after that country you know I mean good treatment of physios were good and then I said to what

01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:36.100
are you doing people because black people don't take the same time as I ran my system or no she

01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:43.380
rang me from patent and she was working as a supervisor for the patients the clinics of all

01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:49.060
the consultants so she said this consultancy make sure you give her a lot of pain it is expensive

01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:56.340
that's what good black people so did you get that one I do not to Freeman she said Vanessa

01:18:57.060 --> 01:19:00.180
doesn't matter how expensive it is you're going to have it because I think that's what

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:06.100
somebody does their research they find that's what good black people not all the other tablets so

01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:13.700
and so far there I am you're very good I had enough physio because then the physio thing

01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:17.220
and I've faced you for many months were busy so my friend's sisters are physio

01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:20.740
he found us oh no who said we could not

01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:23.220
um

01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:34.820
we have to check your heart and you know your heart muscles but you'll have to come back a patient

01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:40.180
the next thing I knew they had how many appointments for me going into our you know my heart

01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:45.060
muscles of my heart is all right it checked it and everything's fine Vanessa just had a blip

01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:49.540
whatever so um and had good physio lots of physio I had

01:19:52.580 --> 01:20:01.300
did you did you ever think you would be retiring in this country I thought of retiring my idea was

01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:07.060
because I did have the land home and I would have a place built there which

01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:13.780
was in the process of being built and I would go home for the winters and come here for the

01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:17.780
service because I'd wind it up and work with the girls oh I'll be going over the winters and

01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:24.820
they'll come in the summer keep here and then come but unfortunately when I had um this incident

01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:29.300
I was you know what that might be a warning your family's and then I thought about it long and had

01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:34.420
I so I'll only see Mark because he likes traveling I won't see night on the river because he's taking

01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:39.380
him but then you know but Mark loves come you know let's travel and he just fits in you know

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:49.620
and then had some problems with finance I send on I saw this nonsense you know I'll leave it so

01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:56.020
two years ago maybe three years ago sold a lot my leg was sorted out and then my aunt let me

01:20:56.020 --> 01:21:06.900
a property I sold that as well so you've let go of that yeah and your hands my nephew was so was so

01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:11.460
so loyal so good you know home to sell land you know what problems you get

01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:19.060
you know home to sell things when I went down in 2014 took him to see everything and got the

01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:25.780
papers and everything the man wanted to buy the land around me here he was so anxious and then

01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:31.300
he got it sold he done everything he sent the certificate the check went paid him

01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:38.580
gave him the number what to do and see me find his house and um he said auntie I say well I'll

01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:43.540
have to pay you because at the end of the day if I had an agent no I say you have he had this nice

01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:49.540
house but underneath you'd have two flats so I said you know what you want bricks you want this

01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:53.940
because you own the house you haven't done it yet and two of you know we can we can have so I said

01:21:53.940 --> 01:22:00.740
you saw that she said the flat is yours she sent a picture of the flats the you know the flat is

01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:03.940
yours until you come down I'll tell you what there's washing machine the flat is with

01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:09.460
three times bigger and you can start laughing your heads off I say you rent it because you have a

01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:13.060
daughter come in she just had a little boy two-year-old and you have a daughter she's going

01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:18.980
to come then probably want to study that's income for you because it is a lot of money trying to

01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:23.060
get your children abroad to study unless they win scholarships and you still have some money to have

01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:30.580
them so I say that's income for you and they were so loyal so honest not often because people say

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:35.860
I just learned you said oh you tell me send money and I send money to do that just give it to her

01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:42.740
sorted out gone to the people for power of atonement everything then it got it sent via the

01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:51.300
full mark was I sent via your phone okay to my granddaughter so until I don't have money you know

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:59.060
never done says clock shooting like flat caps my friend was gonna show me some until you know

01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:04.180
those shoes you send god I don't want them every day and I just give them dolly my niece who just

01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:09.620
ran she's going home end of the next week so I bought some other clocks with fun because you

01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:17.700
know he's got some big money home true huh yes so um you you get and sometimes I think of the

01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:23.060
junior I think something will go out of there to be kind to you and I think yes I've been kind

01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:29.380
to people so probably a stranger is doing for me or somewhere across abroad you know and even to

01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:35.460
the refugees when they came in from Africa my friends are too hot might be a killer I mean we

01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:42.580
friended a few of them because some of them spoke French some was Portuguese and some was like the

01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:48.340
Belgian French and the ladies have been I say in the snow they have flip-flops they walked around

01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:53.780
so there's me try and find where they live and Costa was living somewhere you wouldn't

01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:59.540
you wouldn't put your dog in there my place so I went to the council Peter said to me

01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:02.980
what let you come back they're going to meetings because I said is it because they're black you're

01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:09.620
thinking of the subi and all this thing and these people walking around you know and Costa was here

01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:13.700
for two years and I used to invite them cook food for them or get stuff for them and

01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:20.260
and they decided to send Costa to her after two years so I said I knew the woman because I used

01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:26.900
to go to these meetings I said you can't do that so I said Costa you got all your papers sorting

01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:33.380
out the lawyer yes he said I have to wait I said Jane you come and live with me just give him pocket

01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:40.340
money and so I asked Pete I told the boys as well and my friend said oh you might have been

01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:46.420
a killer in this country when I was driving him but that boy said and he told people from Angolan

01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:52.260
and he said God look after you this is a nice person Costa live with me for a few weeks and I

01:24:52.260 --> 01:24:57.060
said you learn English now Costa none of this speak in Angolan money so he was listening to

01:24:57.860 --> 01:24:59.860
talking to

01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:16.180
if he doesn't hear from me for a couple weeks then he'll ring me and he got married at

01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:25.220
because his wife has got um mental problem and she was a great maneuver you know anyhow

01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:33.940
um Costa then he named one after me and he named one after Peter

01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:38.980
and he was in problems about four years ago with the social services

01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:45.220
you know he threatened a train well the girl must have said one of the daughters said that social

01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:49.460
server come and take the train they come and do this like I had to walk up and down in court they

01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:56.260
give the train for fostering yeah the girl said I've had a friend of a pink bed she said no I only

01:25:56.260 --> 01:26:02.660
said that you know my father you know I they just enlist in this and police around oh well so I had

01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:07.300
to get a papasi the court case you know down in Cardiff going with him I said it was social

01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:12.900
because he always accused black men of being aggressive I said when we talk in the Caribbean

01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:17.780
we touched we talked but I said you will think it's something sexual and because he speaks two

01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:22.580
languages three languages I please book I said you think he's aggressive because he tries to put a

01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:27.460
emphasis on the English language he's not aggressive but you always treat black men

01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:32.580
and then I said of course the door speak let me speak for you and then the barrister then came one

01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:36.900
day I don't know why all this nonsense is going on and he's chatting to me and say this is what

01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:42.260
what is happening today you have literally you know he was so very good and went to the lawyer's

01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:49.300
room because Maria didn't have a lawyer or somebody an interpreter so I said you supposed I go to

01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:53.620
meetings I didn't all the palms and the cams and all these abbreviations are social I'd go to

01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:58.980
meetings with him with Maria and I know the chair said she got to have an interpreter and he said

01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:04.740
I'll walk out the next time because as they didn't so you see all the racism all the thing they didn't

01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:15.620
care so um I think from what I went for I'll never see anybody I'll never see injustice of people

01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:18.660
not at all you know because I was

01:27:26.340 --> 01:27:31.860
is a very out of all of them is a nice and there's one left and she's in London and there's another

01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:40.020
lot from Brazzaville and I think the lot would think come anyone everything Peter is to take

01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:46.260
the one boy said he ran through forest and he had terrible six he was a six foot four boy

01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:55.300
but his legs was like my wrist his arm was then he had a terrible soreness for his eyes was yellow

01:27:55.940 --> 01:28:00.660
we took him to the doctor and because I could explain myself them speak French and I knew that

01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:05.780
I was for him to go to look when Peter's car was a little um

01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:13.620
a smaller car and we took this tall boy and I was going to him for his treatment and the one day

01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:20.900
because the street you forget to ring casualty they wouldn't treat him and so I was working I

01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:27.300
got some stuff there I went to their place and I sort of looked at this we don't treat him with

01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:31.060
gloves and everything he didn't have anything goes what he didn't have anything like easy was

01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:38.180
bad sickling and he was still and girls gave me some stuff and things you know my colleagues and

01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:44.660
all but um and two weeks there he said oh no pull not push it pass on Peter said there's a big

01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:48.740
river going off first and he wants to preach in two weeks he wanted to be a he's preaching

01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:54.340
money making all that thing so this lot I didn't bother I see them occasionally but I

01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:59.940
you know and I said well you said it comes after you that's the mother of so-called mother she said

01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:03.940
that I don't believe and I said you're going back to brazil for holidays

01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:09.380
but of course there's a nice

01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:15.540
yeah I think when you have a when you're open and you have that

01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:21.540
intuition isn't it yeah you could kind of know make the right kind of choices

01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:28.820
um final question I think what what do you think is the value of having these stories

01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:35.300
accessible to the younger generation what do you think do you think it matters that other people

01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:43.780
hear this I do think it matters because nobody knows your story if you don't give it to them

01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:47.700
everybody think you come through the ranks and you find nothing happened

01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:53.860
but I think it's still you saying the strength some people could have

01:29:56.180 --> 01:30:03.700
the negative and turn it into positive the support you get from families and good friends

01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:09.300
and I think the young people need to know or people after me because

01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:15.540
it won't always be nice for them it doesn't matter whether you've got all the race relation

01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:22.100
rules and the laws and the thing the institution some will come and they practice what they think

01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:28.580
is good some will go others come and they think to hell with it because right now we've got

01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:35.780
right-wing government in power and you can see it all around and they wouldn't care and it's always

01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:44.500
the people who are poor who are black another ethnicity they'll be paying the price so I think

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:51.460
it is nice to have stories and I mean this is just a nutshell of my story I would go on and on

01:30:51.460 --> 01:30:57.220
and on with what I had to put up with what I had to endure with everything some nights come in here

01:30:58.100 --> 01:31:04.180
crying and thinking have I got to put up with that I think I better go home I gotta go St. Lucia

01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:08.980
let's go and that's he by the land I think that's his language

01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:14.260
and no I think no you've gone for all of that you had the strength and you had the courage

01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:18.900
and you had the tenacity to stand up to people to challenge people as well

01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:22.820
and why not could be a home as well

01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:25.540
and why not could be a home as well

01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:37.540
Vanessa Sarah OBE thank you

01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:38.260
here

01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:53.780
but thank you for your time thank you thank you yeah and I didn't say whatever Peter support from

01:31:53.780 --> 01:31:58.660
Peter as well because he faced the same thing we both faced the same thing he faced when he came

01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:04.100
here and the first job he applied because he was doing print and I know print was that he went and

01:32:04.100 --> 01:32:09.540
he said yes yes we'll have you and the first day he went in he refused to work with him

01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:16.340
because he thought he was a white man his name Peter his face he went in to work they tell him

01:32:16.340 --> 01:32:24.500
start and he went in and he said he not working I'd rather walk away and the MP heard Mr Hughes

01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:31.380
and he went to speak but there was no law stopping that and Peter never forget it

01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:35.860
I'll never forget the patient who said to me and she was crippled in a bed

01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:43.300
get your blood you're not going to put your black hands on me and Peter's never forgotten

01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:48.900
we're not going to work with you you don't want a black man here working

01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:55.700
how do you take that and turn that around

01:32:55.700 --> 01:33:01.460
I'll show them I'll show them I've been to places I'm the only black woman I don't care

01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:10.260
you know I don't care because I've got this inner strength and sometimes I think I stand up to it

01:33:10.260 --> 01:33:17.380
I think I've done whoops lazy you know but somebody's got to do it I've stood up for my

01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:24.740
colleagues you know I've got this young lady I've seen from Guyana and she's been there for me

01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:31.380
she's quite timid and I've stood up for her and when you want to treat her and

01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:38.740
and she thinks you're my big sister Vanessa as well as other colleagues oh I'll read her

01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:44.340
the footballer Gavin and his mom because she's not quite worried and do this I said look stop

01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:50.740
talking stop backbiting her and stood up for her and said you know you just watched Rita you work

01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:56.420
and they work with you and they always try to think they can put you into something deep and

01:33:57.860 --> 01:34:04.180
there were some good people there were some nice people said me Vanessa you know that that happened

01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:08.020
I'm just telling you and if I had a meeting it come to my attention who names mention

01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:17.300

01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:26.900

01:34:26.900 --> 01:34:35.700
what I had in it and so whatever reward I get wasn't because and and some people think I said

01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:41.940
