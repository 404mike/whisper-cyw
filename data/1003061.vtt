00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Even though this band has only started about a year and a half or so ago, they're really getting to be quite popular.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
They've been doing quite a lot of concert work. We wish to thank them for their contributions.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Right now, we're going to have some talk about remembering.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.000
My grandfather's parents and grandmother came over from Wales in 1900, and they landed in New York City in May.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
They came with four children ages 6 to 14.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.000
They were coming across the country by train, but before they left Wales, they were told all these horror stories about the cowboys and the Indians.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The Indians scalped you and the cowboys just as well shoot you for nothing.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So when they were on a day out of Chicago, five cowboys came on the train. They were all afraid.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
My grandmother told the children to stop staring and be quiet.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Speaking in Wales, one of the cowboys turned around and looked at her.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
After a while, my grandparents started the children singing, which they had been doing along on the train, and everybody on the train liked to hear them singing.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Because each of them sang... Well, Dave sang in bass, and Maude, my mother, sang in alto, and May soprano, and Albert tenor.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And my grandmother had a good soprano voice, and my grandfather was a tenor.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So they started the children singing.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And one of the cowboys turned around and stared at them.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And pretty soon he got up and walked towards them.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And of course they got scared.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But they looked up at him, and then they saw tears running down his cheeks.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
He says, do not be afraid. In Welsh to them.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
He says, because I am from Wales. I left Wales seven years ago, and that's the most beautiful music that I've ever heard since I left there.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
My grandmother started talking with him, and she found out that he had not been riding home.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So she told him he better ride home to his mother.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And tell her that he was all right.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
But the first Indians they saw was when they got off the train at Auburn.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
But they weren't very bad-looking Indians.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000
They went to my grandmother's brother's place, which was at Covington, which is just out between Auburn and Black Diamond.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And my grandfather got work right away in the mines in Black Diamond.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Mr. Morgan, the mine superintendent, took a liking to my grandfather and soon found him a house.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000
It was the one house that was next to the confectionery store across from the depot in Black Diamond.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Being a mining town, it was kind of a bad place with all the pool halls and taverns.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And my grandparents realized there was no place for the young men that were working in the mine, the young single Welsh people, to go.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
So they opened up their house to them. And day and night people came and went.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
My grandmother had a steady order for five pounds of tea a month from Dan Davis the tea man.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
They came out on the train from Seattle.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Even after they moved out into the country on the farm between Auburn and Enumka, the Welsh people still came.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And even some of these Welsh boys, even though they had married and had families, they would still bring their Welsh families out to the country.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And they would all gather around the old pump organ and sing in Welsh and have tea and Welsh cakes.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Of course, my grandfather was Sunday school superintendent.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
He served Sunday school superintendent in the church in Black Diamond.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And then he started the Wabash Presbyterian Church out there where they lived.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And he was Sunday school superintendent for 50 years.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And Welsh people used to come out.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Our church service was because we shared it with the minister from the Auburn church.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
The service was in the afternoon.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And many of the Welsh would, after being in church in Seattle, would drive out to the little country churches, they called it, and come.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And of course, when they came, the raptors really rang with their singing.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Somebody asked me about food.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Well, yes, we did have some Welsh food in our home.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
There was one dish that my mother used to make.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It was called the old country steak.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.000
She would take and cut up onions in the bottom of the casserole and then cut up the steak in thin strips and put a little water with that.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And then put it in the old wood stove in the oven and let it cook for a long time.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
That made a really delicious gravy.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And that usually served with a little thick thing was usually served over potatoes or with parsnips and carrots or rutabagas.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And she did make pickled red cabbage.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I sure wish I knew how she used to do it because I remember used to cutting up the cabbage, but I don't remember how she did it.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And then when my father butchered, she always made faggots.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And she and my grandmother would also take and make bacon and ham by rubbing brown sugar and salt into fresh pork.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And it would hang until it was dry.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
It was wonderful.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
On Ash Wednesday, my grandmother always made croiss.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
It's like a very thin pancake, something like a Swedish pancake.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And after it's cooked, it's buttered and sprinkled with sugar and a little lemon juice and then rolled up and served.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
They were delicious.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And my mother always made pies on Friday.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And she would always make about seven or eight of them.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And we'd always hurry home from school because we knew that she would always roll out this Welsh apple pie.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Now, this was made by rolling out a big sheet of dough.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And then she would cut apples on half of it and then bring the dough up over the top of it and then put it in the oven and bake it.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And then when it was baked, she would take it out, slice it in two, taking that top crust off,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and then spreading the apples over it and with butter and sugar on that.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And it was really wonderful.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And of course, we had the plum pudding and the raisin cake at Easter.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
My mother and my grandmother always attended the St. David's Day or any of the Kamanas here in Seattle or in Renton.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Anytime the Welsh were singing anyplace, they were there.
