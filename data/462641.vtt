00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760
rugby in the 1970s. Can you tell me a little bit about where you would usually watch the

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.720
games and with who?

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:16.040
Well, still living in London at the time, my husband and I were members of London Wash

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:22.640
Rugby where they played Oldeo Park and we used to go there on a regular basis at home

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.760
matches and we used to follow the international matches where we were playing. And it was

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:39.560
with a group of friends that we had great times watching the JPRs and the John Taylors

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:46.600
and the boys in the 70s playing. It was a wonderful period for Wash Rugby.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.240
Does any game stand out?

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:59.800
One game stands out, it was in Scotland when Wales were playing Scotland when John Taylor

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.320
scored a try in the last minute of the game giving Wales victory. That to my mind has

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.640
always stood out as a special moment. And the other one, going back even further, was

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:22.160
at Cardiff when the, I think it must have been the original stadium was there, which

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:34.480
is going back a long time, where Gareth Edwards scored a try and slid yards into mud to do

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:42.880
so. That is also one of the memories that I have of Great Rugby.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.520
How did you feel watching Wales play and win?

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.760
Oh I always enjoy watching that and I have always shouted. I mean when I watch it on

00:01:51.760 --> 00:02:01.280
television now you could probably hear me shouting from cricket. I still follow the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.280
Welsh players, yes.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.160
How do you feel watching it on television compared with being there at the match?

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.720
Oh there is no comparison really. You don't get that atmosphere that you do. No, it was

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:21.280
wonderful to be there. We used to enjoy it very much. That's in love going there now,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:28.920
it's probably warmer and more comfortable watching it from here. But the atmosphere

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.880
isn't quite the same. Because nobody can hear me shouting.
