00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
It's important to understand that the race riots in Wales, the race riots in England,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.800
were not totally in isolation and they're treated as if they were in isolation. But much was

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.640
happening in America at the same time and much was said about that. But there are things that

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:29.280
connect them. So chapter 17 and 18 of our project will relate to Elaine Arkansas, the brutal events

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:38.880
of 1919. And for that we link our work to the superb work of the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:48.400
and this is narrated by the actor Ozzie Davis. This is part two of Elaine Arkansas,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:55.360
which was during the Red Summer in America in October 1919. The all-white jury debates the

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:03.840
charges less than eight minutes per man and finds each guilty. The judge sentences all 12 to death.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:15.040
As far as Arkansas is concerned, the case is closed. But for Scipio Africanus Jones, an African-American

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:23.760
Little Rock attorney, the case is far from closed. As far as he is concerned, the trial is a lynching

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:32.480
that wears the mask of law. Born in slavery, Jones was driven to succeed in life. He worked his way

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.560
through college, studied law, and eventually became Little Rock's most prominent black lawyer.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.560
Jones came into his manhood at a time when opportunities still existed for black people

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:52.320
in Arkansas. In the late 19th century, blacks held political office, became doctors and lawyers,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.320
voted, owned property, built churches, and organized women's clubs and fraternal groups.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.640
By 1919, although segregation is deeply entrenched in Arkansas, Scipio Jones is determined

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:14.080
to save the 12 condemned farmers from execution. But unknown to Jones, Walter White,

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:21.760
the Assistant Secretary of the NAACP and its Chief Investigator of lynchings, is already on the case.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.040
Back in New York, Walter White recruits Colonel George Murphy, a lawyer from Little Rock,

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.480
to represent the condemned men. He is a white southerner, a Confederate war hero,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.200
a first-rate lawyer, and sympathetic to the defendants. Jones agrees to work with Murphy.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.360
Jones and Murphy immediately head to Helena, Arkansas, where racial tensions are still as

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.720
volatile as gas fumes. What I find so extraordinary about Scipio Africanus Jones

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:05.120
is his courage, his willingness to go to Helena, knowing that his life was always at risk as soon

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.240
as he crossed the county line. Knowing he's surrounded by men hoping for the chance to kill

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:17.920
him, Jones sleeps in a different house each night. By day, he and Murphy prepare a motion for a new

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.080
trial. They charge that the presence of the mob and the use of torture made it impossible

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.880
for the defendants to have a fair trial. Jones gathers testimony from a number of tenant farmers,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:38.720
including Ath Banks. I was frequently whipped and also put in an electric chair and shocked

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:46.080
and strangling drugs would be put in my nose to make me tell that others had killed or shot at

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:54.400
white people and to force me to testify against them. The trial judge denies their motion.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:04.720
Jones and Murphy appeal to the Arkansas Supreme Court. The court orders a new trial for six of

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.440
the defendants on technical grounds, but allows the death sentences to stand for the other six.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:20.240
The first six are sentenced to death again, but again the appeals court overturns the verdict.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:29.440
When Murphy dies shortly after the trial, the fate of all 12 men is left in the hands

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:38.640
of Scipio Jones and Murphy's partner, Edgar McKaynie. Jones faces an immediate crisis.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.120
Six of the men are only days away from execution. There seems no hope.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.200
Frank Moore, one of the six, watches prison coppers build their coffins in front of their cells.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:59.200
They showed us our coffins and laughed and said that's where we'll be resting tomorrow night,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.720
but we had faith in our lawyer and said no, that won't happen.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.000
Jones needs four weeks time in order to appeal the case in the federal courts,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.880
and he knows that the Arkansas Supreme Court will not stop the executions. With hours left before

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:24.880
the men are to die, Jones and McKaynie surprise everyone by appealing for and obtaining a delay

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:31.520
of execution from Chancery Court. Some folks perhaps would have even questioned the wisdom

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.560
of Mr. Jones filing a petition in the Chancery Court which had no jurisdiction. Ultimately and

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.840
practically speaking, it turned out to be a brilliant move by Mr. Jones because he did

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:52.160
secure a delay of the execution which bought him and his client's time to pursue more appropriate

00:05:52.160 --> 00:06:00.560
appeals. Several weeks later, the Arkansas Supreme Court removes the stay, but Jones has gained the

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:09.760
time he needs to file his appeal in the federal district court. The case is known as Moore versus

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:20.720
Dempsey. Jones's strategy saves the men's lives, but for how long? The NAACP now brings in

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:28.000
Moorefield Story, a constitutional lawyer and president of the NAACP, to work with Jones.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.680
They feel their strongest argument is that the presence of a mob surrounding the court

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:41.360
made it impossible for the defendants to receive a fair trial. Sturgeon Jones are concerned that the

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:50.560
court will reject their appeal as it has already done in a similar case. In 1913, a Georgia mob

00:06:50.800 --> 00:07:00.240
demanded that a jury find Leo Frank, a Jewish manager of a clothing factory, guilty of murdering

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:08.320
a young woman worker at the plant. Frank was innocent, but the judge and jury, intimidated by

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:16.880
the mob, convicted him and Frank was sentenced to death. The United States Supreme Court refused to

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:28.480
intervene and Frank was ultimately lynched. But there was a dissenting voice, Justice Oliver Wendell

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:37.360
Holmes. Jones hopes that Justice Holmes can convince his colleagues to reverse that decision.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.760
On February 19, 1923, the Supreme Court announces its decision,

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:52.560
Justice Holmes speaking for the majority. If the whole case is a mask, that counsel, jury and judge

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:58.720
were swept to the fatal end by an irresistible tide of public passion and the state courts

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:05.600
refused to correct the wrong, then nothing can prevent this court from securing to the petitioners

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.280
their constitutional rights. The Supreme Court orders the case back to the federal district

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:18.160
courts for further review. Jones immediately seizes the opportunity. He pressures the states

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:28.480
to release everyone imprisoned in the case. The state surrenders. By 1925, everyone is released.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:36.480
Jones's victory in Moore versus Dempsey did not compensate for the deaths at Elaine,

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:43.840
but it did help prevent future deaths. For the first time in American history, the Supreme Court

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:51.280
handed down a verdict favoring black defendants in a criminal case. For the next 50 years,

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:57.920
the NAACP will build on Moore versus Dempsey to win other major victories in the Supreme Court

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:05.600
that eventually will help end legal segregation. Although Jones may be little known today,

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:13.920
his legacy remains as one of the first black lawyers to challenge southern legal injustice

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:23.120
and win. No finer tribute has been given him than that written almost 80 years ago in the African

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:32.080
American newspaper, the Arkansas Survey. Mr. Jones went to Helena and took charge of the case

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:38.880
when Helena was a seething cauldron of hate and the least in discretion meant death.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:48.480
For four years, he traveled and investigated and pled until the 13th of January when Governor McCrae

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:58.800
opened the prison gates to the last of the rioters. All hail Jones. Praise him for his knowledge of

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:06.560
the law, his nerve, and his sagacity. He will receive little glory, but it is the great state

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:17.520
of Arkansas which is the real beneficiary of his service and the people of America as well.
