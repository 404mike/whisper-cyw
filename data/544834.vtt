00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
I've been coming to Pembrokes for years so when my wife was offered a job in the National

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.240
Health Service in Pembrokeshire we actually had a choice between North Wales on the Cleme

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.320
Peninsula or Pembrokeshire. We chose Pembrokeshire because I'd fallen in love with it over the

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.520
years climbing. I used to live in Cardiff in Swansea so coming down here rock climbing

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.280
I had a great affection for the place anyway and a lot of good memories. Then we moved

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.520
down and we were actually living in Manabir in a rented accommodation there and I can still

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:40.240
vividly remember being in tears coming down that week we'd settled in we'd just got ourselves

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.440
settled into the house and I got up early in the morning walked down to the I think it was early

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.200
in the morning and was it in the evening whatever it was I can't remember walking down to the to the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:58.160
beach to to see you know the beautiful coastline and just being in state of shock I hadn't heard

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.720
anything about the the disaster at that point or whether it actually got out I don't know

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.240
but we were on Manabir beach and all I can remember my first memory is was the sound not not the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.680
smell actually the smell came on pretty quick afterwards it was just the sound there was a glup

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.800
glup glup glup sound of the of the water instead of a sort of a splashing sound and it was

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.600
I was just just gobsmacked I mean still makes me feel a little bit emotional now I just remember

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.960
looking at this blackness and on the the rocks and on the seashore and and then I could smell it

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.360
but it was the it was the I guess there was maybe there's a selfish side to this that I was just

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.840
thinking oh my god that's we're screwed you know I'd come here to to be an instructor and to

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.600
teach climbing and and and to be a climber and I just thought that's it it's all over for me I just

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.040
thought the oil on the rocks wouldn't be able to climb because my gear would get damaged I wondered

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.640
how far up it had gone up the cliffs because the tidal range in in Pembrokeshire is huge you know

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.000
especially on spring tides which was happening at the sea empress disaster

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.160
the the the oil would have gone a long way up the up the cliff we were able to go climbing

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.280
you know pretty much straight away there are some some areas that are you know the climb start 30

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.520
30 feet up up the cliff anyway so there wasn't going to be much oil at that level so there

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:45.040
were areas we could go climbing in but the the major top areas the St Govans areas

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:53.840
Stankpole, Mowing Word and anything that was down at sea level were were pretty badly affected

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.680
and the zones like Huntsman's Leap and Stankpole were particularly affected because you the the

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.560
storms couldn't get in there to wash the oil out so I remember that that climbers were

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.720
were asked to go into Huntsman's Leap and and look and if I remember correctly I remember

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:25.440
a big crane lifting the boulders out of Huntsman's Leap and climbers wiped them all down with rocks

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.160
and we put them back into the zone again and I remember losing climbing ropes because of the oil on them

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.800
having some of my slings rock climbing slings got contaminated and losing those

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.120
I remember getting oil on my my rock shoes rock climbing shoes quite a few times because

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.200
stuff would go into the back of cracks and and holes and things like that and that that's where

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.520
the problems were and of course when you go climbing you you just put your ropes down on the

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.920
floor and you know the oil had gone underneath the boulders whilst it looked superficially clean

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:20.960
as you kicked the boulders the sticky tarry oil would would get onto your equipment
