00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Marlee, you really told us your memories, early memories of childhood, the colourful memories,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.500
that you've taken us through the journey of trauma to actually being where you are in Wales

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.500
and how you came to be in Wales.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.500
So when you look back at your life now, what does resilience mean for you as a woman?

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.500
I think for me, coming to Wales, it was like coming home, honestly,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.500
and I mean that, and I've never felt so at home as I do in Wales.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.500
I've met some amazing friends. I've got friends in England as well, who I am in touch with,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.500
because they were my friends from college days, so I'm still in touch with them.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:55.500
One of the nurses I shared accommodation with, Carol Dodgson, and Ruth I shared a house with in Swansea.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.500
But Wales to me has been home. It has been the best thing I ever did.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.500
There's a cosiness about Wales that I think you don't find in England, and the people are friendly,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.500
and it's very much like people looking after their own family. I see a lot of that in Wales,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:24.500
more so than I've seen in communities in England even, but I don't know whether that's just my biasness,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:33.500
but I think it's just meant everything, and I work at the university now, and to me that's like a community in itself,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.500
and most people in the university, you know, we all look out for each other.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:46.500
There's a lot of kindness, people will help each other out, so I've helped people out and took on their lecturing,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.500
if, for example, I've been needed to lecture and somebody's fallen ill or whatever,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:01.500
and I find I just love learning as well, and I've worked in research, and with research you just never stop learning,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.500
and I've always had this passion about education, and that comes from mum and dad both saying,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.500
dad's saying girls have to be educated as well as boys, and mum always said, mum never had a chance for an education,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.500
she always wanted to do that, but of course as a teenager she had to stop to get married,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:27.500
but she learned to read and write Gujarati, which was a total blessing, because without that she would have been lost,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:38.500
so she found solace in prayers and the Bhagavad Gita and the faith books, and I just never really stopped learning,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:46.500
so I studied a bit of Egyptology, I went to Spanish class, I learned a bit of Spanish,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:55.500
my Hindi is not perfect but I can manage, I understand everything, but my expression, my Hindu friends would say to me,

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:06.500
oh your Hindi is very sweet, which means it's a bit sort of broken probably, but I've got Punjabi friends,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:19.500
I've got Hindi friends, I've got all sorts of friends, English friends, Welsh friends, and Wales to me is just magnificent in its beauty and the beaches,

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:32.500
I found my solace through all this trauma in the fact that nature, you know, the sea is literally ten minutes away from here,

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:43.500
and I find the sea has all the answers, walks, woodlands, so many walks around here, Klein Gardens, the Gowers not far,

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:52.500
I just find it such a stunning beautiful area, North Wales as well, but I don't know North Wales as well as I do South Wales,

00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:00.500
I've tried to do everything that I was told I shouldn't do, like I've always been frightened of water,

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:12.500
so I overcame that fear and I trained as a scuba diver, and I also lectured and taught sports diving because I've always been quite defiant as well,

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:23.500
well why can't I do it, if I'm a girl why can't I do this, why can't I do that, you know I've been to Antarctica on a holiday,

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:31.500
and I've tried to do extreme types holidays, I've cycled a lot of the Gower, and I've pushed myself physically,

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:39.500
and I think that's the way I've overcome things, trauma by actually working my body physically, pushing myself,

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:50.500
and overall I have a lot of empathy for people who've suffered, I also have sensitivity, but I also need time for calmness and peace,

00:04:50.500 --> 00:05:00.500
I can't be with people all the time, because I find I can take on other people's feelings, but I recognise that as a child carer literally,

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:12.500
so I know I'm quite sensitive like that, and I do really feel for people who've been widowed in Asian Indian communities,

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:23.500
because I know what that means, and it's sad to say that I also accept that there's assaults and abuses as a common place,

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:32.500
which is also sad to say, but I just found my home here, and also I've done things like mindfulness, I've done aromatherapy,

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:42.500
I think without even knowing it, and I've journaled, written a lot, I've done creative art, but I think without knowing what I was actually really doing,

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:50.500
I sort of somehow have found solace in all these things, and I think in a way without even analysing it,

00:05:50.500 --> 00:06:00.500
I was just always busy, busy running, or busy cycling, or busy doing this, and I think training, because when you're underwater,

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:08.500
if you're scuba diving, you can't think of other things, you've literally got to concentrate on what you're doing, because it could make a big difference,

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:16.500
so there's no wondering, because in normal everyday life your mind can wander back to that,

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:26.500
and to me it's not about the story, I think the story is more important than me, that's what I think, and I think it's a case of what can I do with the story,

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:37.500
and I think you can do a lot with it, because I think you can understand, because women in India for example can't talk about trauma,

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:43.500
divorce is a big no, no, and it's always a woman's fault, with any divorce, it's never the man's fault,

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:52.500
a woman should always try to make things work, and I think I can bring understanding, because women are just being assaulted, abused,

00:06:52.500 --> 00:07:04.500
and they're just so petrified of a divorce, and even a son whose mother gets divorced, even the son could turn against the mother and say,

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:16.500
you know, you got divorced and it's your fault, so I just feel bringing a voice is so much to people who don't have a voice, who can't speak,

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:25.500
there's lots of women in India who will put up with beatings, regularly domestic violence, because they're not able to speak, they're not allowed to speak,

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:35.500
so I think giving voice is what I would bring with this story, and it's not really about me as such, I'm just the vehicle, the vessel if you like,

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:46.500
and I think for me resilience is all about, in part, defiance as well, why shouldn't we, why shouldn't we do all these things, why shouldn't we scuba dive,

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:58.500
why shouldn't we do this, why do we have to have defined roles as a woman, and yes, I still like my cooking and I still enjoy all those sorts of things,

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:08.500
but I think to be who you are and to reach your fullest potential, I think you also have to let go of who you were and what you were,

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:24.500
and that doesn't define me anymore, I'm not defined by what happened to me, it's just part of the story, but it's made me a person who I wouldn't have been had I have had a nicey-nicey upbringing with my father alive,

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:35.500
I would never have believed anybody who would tell me these sorts of things that I've just said, I would never have believed it, so I think that is the gift, I think it's the voice,

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:40.500
and voice for other people, not just for me, that's what I would like to bring.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:56.500
So what I would say, the last thing I would say to my mother, if I could say it to her, I would be, it would be that we are both alright, you both, you wanted both of us to have an education,

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:18.500
stand on our two feet, she always used to say stand on your two feet, and here we are, we are standing, and it's a credit to her, and considering what we went through, we've both done well academically and in other ways, we've come to be our own fullest people.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:28.500
And what would you say to all the male members who turned away from you at a time that your mother needed them the most?

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:51.500
I would say that I think forgiveness is very hard, but I would hope that they would reflect, and I'm no longer driven by vengeance and hatred as I was in my younger years and my teenage years,

00:09:51.500 --> 00:10:04.500
and I would just say try and find compassion in your heart somewhere, there must be some somewhere, that's all I can say.
