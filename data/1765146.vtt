00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.360
in the Welsh language?

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.360
No, no.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.360
There were some Welsh,

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.360
some Welsh,

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.360
that's all,

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.360
we don't sing in Welsh, you see.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.360
And there was a Welsh language, David,

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.360
I don't know if you remember,

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.360
I was listening to the Welsh language,

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.360
some Welsh,

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.360
and we gave one concert a year

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.360
with the two of us together, you see,

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.360
singing,

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.360
well, a little bit of a song,

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.360
and then singing together.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.360
And did you sing in Welsh with the two of you?

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.360
No, no.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.360
We sang in Welsh, but in a group.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.360
And with the choir,

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.360
I mean, a big choir,

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.360
a big group,

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.360
David, Richard, Richard,

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.360
the choir, you see,

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.360
they didn't like to sing in Welsh.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.360
Why did you think that?

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.360
I don't know,

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.360
because they were a bit...

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.360
There were ten or so Welsh people,

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.360
out of ten,

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.360
I think about twenty,

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.360
who started to speak Welsh,

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.360
in English, you see,

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.360
but they weren't very fond of it.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.360
They were singing,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.360
one or two real songs in Welsh

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.360
every year.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.360
And, well,

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.360
I'm not going to say a little bit,

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.360
I'm not going to say much,

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.360
but,

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.360
I came out,

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.360
I came out to the school, you see,

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.360
and I was the only child in the school,

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.360
and I retired,

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.360
five years ago,

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.360
I was in Oslo, Laoghaen,

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:08.360
with the Irish community,

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.360
and I listened to a little choir,

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.360
there were twenty songs, you see,

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.360
and the choir started with Ewan Edwards.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.360
And I didn't see it,

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.360
I was still on the phone,

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.360
I didn't see it,

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.360
I was still listening,

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.360
and the same thing,

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.360
I saw the choir singing,

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.360
first ten, you see,

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.360
and after a year,

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.360
Ewan Edwards sang,

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.360
and, well,

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.360
I don't know if you can see,

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.360
but I believe he was on the choir,

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.360
you see,

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.360
and I was very fond of the choir,

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.360
because they were very,

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.360
they were very eager, you know,

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.360
to sing,

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.360
and they were very fond of singing in Welsh,

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.360
and I, well, Ewan,

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.360
Ewan is very fond of speaking Welsh,

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.360
but Ewan can't,

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.360
I'm the only one who speaks Welsh.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.360
How is the choir with you

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.360
in the Irish language?

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.360
Well, someone shows the songs,

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.360
first, they play the songs, you see,

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.360
they sing in English,

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.360
and they are very fond of singing in Welsh,

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.360
some that aren't Welsh,

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.360
because some aren't Welsh, you see,

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.360
by Canadians,

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.360
they are very fond of singing,

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.360
they are very fond of singing in Welsh,

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.360
they are very fond of it,

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.360
there's no group,

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.360
no one, no one,

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.360
comes to sing Welsh,

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.360
and, well,

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.360
I don't know if you can see,

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.360
well, they are very fond of Welsh,

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.360
and they are fond of the choir,

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.360
from the Irish, you see,

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.360
I believe they work very well with the choir,

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.360
they are the other choir.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.360
How is the choir in the Irish?

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.360
We are eight people,

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.360
and, well,

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.360
it's a new thing,

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.360
the choir is very good,

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.360
of course, it's a bit...

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.360
I see the choir in the Irish,

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.360
it's very good,

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.360
you see, it's a very good choir.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.360
It's a very good choir.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.360
Do you have a little bit of a history?

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.360
No, no,

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.360
I don't have a lot of history,

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.360
I don't have

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.360
a lot of films,

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.360
I don't have a lot of films,

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.360
I only have a few films in Montreal,

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.360
in Caperhalen, in Ontario.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.360
Yes, well,

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.360
how did you,

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.360
as a state-governer,

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.360
see yourself in the Otoak,

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.360
now in the Otoak Music Festival?

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.360
Yes, I think it's a bit like

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.360
a Quebec competitive music festival,

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.360
where the Bernaids,

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.360
all over the country,

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.360
from Lloyger,

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.360
from the Albanians,

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.360
and the Bernaids,

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.360
it's a brief over with my wife.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.360
In Cany, now, tonight?

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.360
No, no, with the choir.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.360
There's nothing to say about that,

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.360
but I've heard that they don't

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.360
listen like tenor soloists do,

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.360
you see.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.360
Yes, in Montreal, yes, Montreal,

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.360
yes, yes.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.360
When was that?

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.360
Oh, through...

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.360
about thirty years ago.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.360
I had been in school

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.360
and I was thinking,

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.360
I was really interested in

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.360
something else, and

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.360
I was going on.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.360
It was a new experience for me,

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.360
not only for me,

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.360
the soloists in this orchestra,

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.360
but I felt like it was time

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.360
to practise it.

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:28.360
And maybe,

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.360
that would be OK.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.360
And what about the children?

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.360
You were in school,

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.360
the Bernaids, the Bernaids,

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.360
with them?

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.360
Yes, we were in school,

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.360
one of the schools,

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.360
I went to another school,

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.360
which was like,

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.360
in the south of Cairn,

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.360
we were in the same school,

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.360
the Bernaids, the Bernaids,

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.360
and the school was down

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.360
in the place,

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.360
I think, of Lom,

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.360
down in the Slam area,

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.360
you see,

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.360
in the south of Lom,

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.360
in the south of Lom,

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.360
in the south of the country,

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.360
in the whole of Europe,

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.360
and Africa, you see.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.360
And the Hebrew teacher

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.360
from the school

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.360
came to me in Welsh

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.360
and he had a lot of

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.360
Welsh songs.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.360
And he was like,

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.360
I'm going to learn these songs

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.360
and sing a few songs in Welsh,

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.360
the great rebel

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.360
and he was singing in Welsh.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.360
Now, back in

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.360
the year

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.360
1945, or 46,

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.360
you see,

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.360
there was a plant

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.360
that was growing,

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.360
it was growing, it was growing

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.360
and the plant itself,

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.360
and the plant itself,

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.360
a few years ago,

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.360
it was growing,

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.360
and the plant itself,

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.360
and the plant itself,

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.360
it was growing, you see,

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.360
it was growing,

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.360
and the plant itself,

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.360
you see.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.360
Oh, thank God!

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.360
Oh, thank God!

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.360
Thank God!

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.360
The cover,

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.360
I think, is very nice.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.360
Johnnie, how long

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.360
have you been singing

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.360
since 1990?

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.360
Well, in one way

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.360
it's been a while,

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.360
a long time, yes.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.360
In Caltan, Calentaly,

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.360
as a kind of soloist,

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.360
you see,

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.360
and with a good audience,

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.360
since I was in depression,

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.360
and I was singing

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.360
for about seven years

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.360
in Catholic music,

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.360
also.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.360
It's a very important thing,

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.360
isn't it?

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.360
And I've been singing

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.360
for hours,

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.360
and I think I've been

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.360
singing for a long time in Calentaly,

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.360
and in 1936,

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.360
I was in the

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.360
Tend of Solos,

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.360
in Abergwynd,

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.360
but I haven't been there

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.360
for a long time,

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.360
but I've been there,

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.360
I've been to the cover of Dr. Johnnie,

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.360
I'm Mrs. Ewes, Pernille,

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.360
and I've been there,

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.360
and I've been there for about

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.360
about

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.360
1953,

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.360
Pernille and Brie,

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.360
of course,

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.360
in 1953,

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.360
and now I've been there

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.360
for about a year,

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.360
in 1954,

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.360
in Stagernes.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.360
Well, I've been there,

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.360
I've been to Stagernes,

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.360
I've been there for a long time,

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.360
of course, I've been there,

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.360
I've been there for a long time,

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.360
I've been to Stagernes,

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.360
and I've been to Stagernes,

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.360
but I haven't been there for a long time,

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.360
I've been to the Pisaindrop,

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.360
not the Pisaindrite.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.360
But that's a very good place.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.360
But I've had a lot of

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.360
sports experience there,

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.360
but I've been

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.360
in the school

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.360
there,

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.360
I haven't been

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.360
in the group,

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.360
but I've been there for a long time,

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.360
as you can see,

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.360
but I've been there for a long time,

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.360
in Stagernes,

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.360
but every time I go back,

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.360
I always go back to the school,

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.360
I've been in Bari, in Abertau,

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.360
in Lille,

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.360
and in...

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.360
Carpignin,

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.360
in Lille,

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.360
Bari,

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.360
Stagernes,

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.360
one of them was there.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.360
I remember that in the spring of 1990,

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.360
in Abertau,

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.360
in 1964,

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.360
I was there.

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.360
Do you go back to Llyfann

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.360
with the Welsh again?

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.360
Not through us,

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.360
but through one of the guys

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.360
who was a bit from Montreal,

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.360
and we went down

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.360
to the station,

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.360
you see, High Street,

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.360
and it was a bit cold,

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.360
to go back down

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.360
to the stadium.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.360
But...

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.360
I was in the train,

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.360
I was in the train to the stadium,

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.360
with the Welsh and Welsh.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.360
How did you get to know

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.360
the Welsh

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.360
with the Welsh

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.360
in the station?

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.360
There's only one Welsh,

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.360
I don't know,

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.360
I'm not very good, you see.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.360
Everyone says,

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.360
I'm not very good,

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.360
I'm not very good,

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.360
I'm not very good,

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.360
I don't know, I'm not very good.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.360
What did you learn in Welsh?

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.360
How did you learn Welsh?

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.360
Oh, I learned it.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.360
I learned it

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.360
in the school of Henry Wynne,

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.360
Dr John Hughes,

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.360
I learned it in the school of Henry Wynne,

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.360
who was the main Welsh speaker

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.360
in the school of Henry Wynne,

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.360
and I learned it

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.360
in the school of Henry Wynne,

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.360
and I learned it

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.360
all of a sudden,

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.360
I must teach the language for cause.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.360
There's one person in my gang,

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:32.980
No one島

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.960
I learned things well outside of our venue,

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.020
as a Feels Good person,

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.440
we always spoke good English,

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:45.000
And I'm having a good time.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.320
I'm learning a lot of languages.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.560
I'm learning a lot of languages in one year.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.320
Well, I'm learning a lot of languages,

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.920
but I don't have the time to study.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.920
I'm learning a lot of languages.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.200
I'm going to school and play a lot of games.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:07.280
And then in school, I'm learning the language precisely.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.080
I'm learning a lot of languages in grade two.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:15.000
When I'm in grade two, I'm going to school.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.480
I'm learning a lot of languages.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.400
I'm learning a lot of languages.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.560
Do you plan to study in the future?

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.960
Do you plan to go to school?

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.640
No, I don't plan to go to school.

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:33.280
And I'm going to study in the future.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.520
I'm studying.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.520
That's silly, that is.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.520
I don't know that.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:43.520
I'm studying in the future.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.520
In the future.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.520
I'm going to study.

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.520
I'm going to study.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.520
What's that?

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.520
That's enough.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.520
I'm going to study.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.520
I'm going to study.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.520
I'm going to study.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.520
I'm going to study.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:05.760
And what about me in Welsh?

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:11.760
Do you think I'm better than any of the other people in Welsh?

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.760
Well, the people, the young people,

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.760
I'm not sure, I'm not sure,

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.760
I'm going to study Welsh.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.760
OK.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Was there any old memories with you from your life in Wales before coming to Canada?

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Well, I started working in the club for about ten years.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
I worked on the screens for about ten years.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
And strikes, you know.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
It was a lot of work.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.240
Ten years, that's what it was.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.240
It was a lot.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.240
It was a lot of work, a lot of strikes,

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.240
a lot of work, a lot of work,

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:04.240
a lot of work, you see.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:08.240
And well, I was studying.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.240
I don't know if I'm going to be able to go to the strike,

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.240
the big strike,

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.240
in 1925, I studied,

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.240
and then I went to the sea.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.240
I was there when the war broke out.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.240
And...

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:26.820
Do you remember the

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.820
strike in Godrardraig when you were a child?

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.820
Oh, I do.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.820
I remember when I was living in Pantig,

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:34.820
I went up to Godrardraig,

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.820
and I was watching the TV,

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.820
and I thought,

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.820
well, maybe a month or so.

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.820
The family was on their way,

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.820
you know, on their way,

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:46.820
down the street, playing.

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:48.820
And something else I remember

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.400
was that the men were very angry,

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.400
they were hanging around

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.400
with a bunch of

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.400
people on the side of the street,

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.400
you know.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.400
They were beating them up.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.400
Were you angry?

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.400
I think I was angry at my family.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.400
I think.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.400
And then I went to the sea,

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.400
and I was there,

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:15.400
and I saw another thing.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.400
And I went to Pantig,

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:19.560
anyway,

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.560
and there it was

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.560
when there was a blast.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.560
I looked over,

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.560
and there was a conversation.

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:31.560
really

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.560
it was

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.560
really

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.560
terrible.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.560
I went to eat a little darling.

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.560
My father.

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.560
What a beautiful girl.

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.560
Because she was one of our

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.260
friends.
