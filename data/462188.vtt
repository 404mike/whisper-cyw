00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I was highly indignant at the idea of flooding the whole area.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I mean, I didn't protest or anything like that, but I happened to be up in that area when this was mooted,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and I was very indignant. And I could quite see why people objected as they did.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And I don't think this part of the world was aware of it for a long time,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000
because although we saw it on television, unless you happen to know something about Truberin or the area,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
as I did, you weren't all that interested. It wasn't until it actually happened,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
but it struck you, you know, what nerve, they had to sort of flood the place.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
But there has been over the years so much of the area has been flooded.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I mean, if you go around South Wales, you find massive areas that have flooded.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You don't have to go up to Truberin. But I suppose the idea...

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Another area that upset us here more possibly than Truberin was the Eppint business.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Eppint was a nasty thing. We didn't like Eppint at all. It was near home.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000
But I don't think even there... It wasn't until we saw it on television that the horror of it struck home.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
That is where television has this impact. It is immediate, and you can see it at once.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Whereas if it's on the radio, it's as though it's second... you know, there's that much away from you.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
But Eppint, you saw not much, but you did see and you were aware.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
But Truberin really hit home because they made a big thing of Truberin.
