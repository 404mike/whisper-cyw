00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
This is chapter 15 in our series in relation to the race riots in Wales.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:20.080
This relates to Cardiff and is about the perpetrators, those arrested by the police and charged by the court with riotous assembly leading the riots, which is important.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.480
Now the reason it's important is because mobs don't just happen.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:34.080
You may have an instant flare-up but it doesn't continue for days and it doesn't continue on a whole range of different sites.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.480
For that you need agitators, you need leaders, people who inspire a mob.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.840
That's why the offence of riotous assembly is important.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.480
These people who we're going to name here are, except for one, all career criminals.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:01:00.320
Most of them have offences related to stealing and violence and that's the reason we're identifying these 10 perpetrators.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:10.000
They were central and are identified by the police consistently as being wherever the violence and robbery was.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:21.520
Now in the court case which was held in Swansea County Court, a number of men were found guilty in court of being ringleaders, rioters.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.520
There were 10 of them.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.040
Now Albert Sparks was 20 years old. He was a sailor. He was sentenced to three months imprisonment.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:02:02.080
Now in relation to Sparks, it's important to say when he was first arrested, the first offence he was charged with was wearing a sailor's uniform without authority.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:11.200
Which may mean at that time he wasn't in the Navy or he wasn't supposed to be in uniform.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:21.600
So it's important to realize the jobs credited to the men in court are what we've listed.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.800
Not whether they were actually in the army because the likelihood is they were demobbed.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:36.640
And if you were demobbed from World War I, you were allowed to wear the uniform for six months after leaving.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:45.120
And in fact many of them didn't actually have any other clothes but the uniform including great coats.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.680
So they may not have actually been serving soldiers at the time of the riots.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.600
James Bond, a dock labourer, a career criminal, was given 20 months hard labour.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:11.120
William Jones was a coal trimmer. He was given an additional four months imprisonment to be served after a current term already in prison.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.240
He had an 11 year criminal record.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.800
Patrick Linehan was age 38. Born in County Cork, Ireland, he was a dock labourer.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:27.360
He had a 21 year old criminal record and he was sentenced to nine months hard labour.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:36.480
Charles Snell was a soldier. He was age 21. He had a seven year criminal record and was sentenced to nine months hard labour.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.880
Sidney Blashill was age 36, was a marine engineer.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.720
He had an 11 year criminal record and was sentenced to 18 months hard labour.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:56.400
Timothy Clancy, age 30, was a labourer. He had a 12 year old criminal, 12 year criminal record and he was sentenced to 18 months hard labour.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.440
William Parker is listed as being a soldier as well, age 24.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.480
He had a nine year criminal record and was sentenced to 18 months hard labour.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:15.280
Ernest Perkins, age 28, was a labourer. He had an 11 year criminal record. He was sentenced to 18 months hard labour.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:30.480
His criminal record included three offences from 1917 to 1918 of illegally wearing military uniform and wound stripes, which identified invalid soldiers.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.320
He was charged with false pretenses, which may have related to begging as a wounded veteran.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.920
James Rees, age 27, born in Swansea, was a soldier.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:51.040
He is listed as being in the New Zealand Army. He had an 18 year criminal record and was sentenced to 18 months hard labour.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:05:02.480
The court record shows, although people may have thought he was from New Zealand, and that's the impression the paper showed, he was also known as Moses Rees.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:12.800
Which is interesting because in 1909 Moses Rees of Swansea was court martial for desertion and theft from the Welsh regiment.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:23.840
It's also interesting that none of the white men that were sentenced to prison were merchant seamen and therefore the argument that black people were keeping them out of their jobs was spurious at best.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:31.760
It may also have been extremely convenient for men that wanted to steal from properties under the cover of mob violence.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:39.680
Now at a later stage we will look at the causes that people have related to the riots.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.440
Economic conditions, lack of employment, etc. etc. Resentment.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:06:01.840
But one thing is for sure, those 10 perpetrators, ringleaders, all identified by the police were not out of work because of black people taking their jobs.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.000
The jobs black people could take in Cardiff at the time were limited.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:16.960
In the main they were merchant seamen or people who provided services to merchant seamen such as boarding houses etc.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:26.480
What is clear, these men were career criminals and as such benefited considerably from the riot.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:36.640
In fact one of them, Sidney Blashill, when arrested had three different outfits of clothes on, all stolen from a shop.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.840
Thank you for listening.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:47.120
Chapter 16, which is part 2 of Cardiff, will relate to the black people who were arrested and what happened to them.
