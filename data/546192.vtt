00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
I would go out after dinner, my bright new boots squeaking into the white world, on the

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.000
seaward hill, to call on Jim and Dan and Jack, and to pad through the still streets, leaving

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.880
huge deep footprints on the hidden pavements.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.960
The silent, one-clouded heavens drifted onto the sea.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.160
We returned home through the poor streets where only a few children fumbled with bare

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.160
red fingers.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.120
In the will, rutted snow, and cat-called after us, their voices fading away as we trudged

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.200
uphill into the cries of the dark birds and the hooting of ships out in the whirling bay.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.320
And then at tea, the recovered uncles would be jolly, and the ice-cake looked in the center

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.320
of the table like a marble grave.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.840
Auntie Hannah laced her tea with rum, because it was only once a year.
