00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Adam and Kirsty's Mom Are you guys single?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.500
No.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:03.740
No.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:04.400
Why is that?

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:15.200
I'm rather a companion relationship with a little bit of an anky-panky.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.400
So, I'm allowed to say that.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.400
Adam and Kirsty's Mom You're allowed to say that.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.500
Say what you like.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.500
I like with an anky-panky.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:40.500
But, now and again I prefer that I'm not commanding it to talk to anyone at all.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.500
So, you called it an anky-panky. Is the physical part of the relationship important to you?

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.500
Yes.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.500
Like, the fact.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.500
Yeah.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.500
Yeah.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.500
Yeah.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.500
Is it as important as the companion side of it and talking to people and spending time with them?

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.500
A little bit, yeah.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.500
Yeah, that's fair enough.
