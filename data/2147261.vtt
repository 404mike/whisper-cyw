00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But first thing now, can you just tell us your name and where you were born, both in English and also in Urdu?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Urdu is not my language.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What is your language?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
My language is Gujarati, but there's not many Gujaratis in Nepal.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Are you okay to say it in English and Gujarati?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You have to have the two languages.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It would be great. I would like to hear. I don't even know what it sounds like actually.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Can you speak Urdu?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I can't speak Urdu. It's okay.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Okay?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Yeah.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Okay. My name is Yasmin Jetwa. I was born in Africa, in East Africa, in Uganda.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And my birthplace was Kampala.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And in 1971, when EDM had overthrown the country, we were overthrown to different countries.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But because my mum had a British passport, we ended up in Britain as refugees.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
But loads and loads of us came. So they were all scattered to Canada and India and Rome.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
My dad went to Rome because he had a citizenship for that country. He couldn't join us.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And my uncle. And so when we come to Britain, it was October 1971, I think.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And it was snowing that time.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So the charity, there's charity, they're very popular.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Red Cross came to receive us on the bottom of the plain.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Took us to the camps. And the camp was in North Wales.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And it was a RAF camp. There was a big camp, but they were not occupied by them.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
It was empty. So they replaced all the refugees in there.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Since two different places, but we ended up there anyway.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We were well looked after. They took lovely care of us.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Given us each and everything. Because when we came, we did an Avna thing.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
On your suitcase?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And we were only, I was only young then. I think I was about 14.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And we stayed there. After a couple of months, they moved us to Leamington Spa in Warwickshire.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And then from there we stayed a couple of months, still refugees.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Then we went to Kensington in London.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
In a big posh building they put us all in there.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And then from there I think we had to decide where we would like to go.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And to settle down. So they gave us a couple of choices.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
But we couldn't decide because my dad and my uncle was not still here.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
They were in Rome. So we had to wait for them to come over to join us.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So our family, my uncle, auntie's family, we were together with the children.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So when they came, then they sent them to Pontypryd and other different places.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
They gave you a couple of choices. So when they, both uncle and my dad went to Pontypryd.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
When they seen the sceneries, they were so beautiful and greenery.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And they thought, oh wow, they were somewhere in Kashmir.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So we had three houses between two families.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And from A to Z they provided us in the house. Everything brand new.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
We were six siblings, my mom and dad.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So there was eight of us. They gave us one one of each of one one thing.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
But they done it all nice for us, looked after us.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So we started going to school. But I was never ever interested in school.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
In Uganda the English was compulsory. That was your language.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Their language, native, that was the next language, but very important language.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So I knew how to speak English anyway.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
So I went to the school over there in Pontypryd for a couple of months.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Till I think I come to sixteen. Then I had a Saturday job.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And then from that onwards I just worked, worked.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And after in 1976 I married and moved to Newport.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And ever since I live in Newport.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:29.000
I was still working till 1990. In between I had my children.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So I stopped in 1990. Then I became a housewife.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I'm from housewife. I found out slowly slowly there's some groups around.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
I went to computer classes and some sewing classes.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And we met some of the friends which we are here. We met through the some.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
From that I started going more and more and more out.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Different groups. See any people. I talk to them and find out is there anything happening.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And since that time I just kept occupied of myself and got involved with so many groups.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000
But my age alive group was first. Which I got committed to it.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So I think it started in 2008. Is that right?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Because I'm terrible with the dates you know.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Very first when Leon Taylor started the group.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Can you remember when you were about like 9 years old or 8 years old.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And what that was like growing up in Uganda.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
My memory is not too good but I can just think of some things.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
It was very hardship growing up.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Because we were not high class. We were not well off. We were just in between.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
My dad was just working and over there women stayed home. My mum stayed home.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And the kids were only small then you know.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And me and my sister was brought up at my grandmother's house.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
While she was 10 and I was 12.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Because we had to look after her.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Because she had a stroke and all that.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And the rest of the family started moving out to other different countries.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
So our childhood was a bit of a sad.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Because we couldn't go to school anything. Because we were busy looking after granny.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
But in between my auntie did try to put us in school to go and study you know.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
So we had a bit of education from there not too much.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
The childhood was ok but hard time.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
We seen the poverty and we seen the hard times.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And when the curfews and things were happening before we were thrown out.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000
You know we were looking after my grandmother and my sister.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
It was very scary.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
My auntie was living next door but they were not much involved.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
So me and my sister we seen a hardship since childhood.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000
What would you say that taught you? Is there anything that taught you?

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
That was teaching you around that time?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
It taught us to see how people are to you.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And if you are not well off person or something.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
You don't count it like you know.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
When you are a basic person you don't count in that society.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And even your relatives put you down.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Because we didn't have a house or anything. We just had a rented property.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
But the rest of the families were well off.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
We were the low ones.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000
But we survived and from that it teaches you about poverty and all that.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Because we had gone through that. We got that feeling.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And when we see these Simon Seeker coming or they have got nothing you feel for them.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
You can relate can't you?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
That related is that.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Because I say to my sister sometimes she wears things.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I say don't forget your past.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
You were brought up in a very simple way.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So you know don't forget your past.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Keep your past on.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
So then you are what?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
You said twelve you came over here.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Twelve to fourteen.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Fourteen.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
You were coming over here.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
What was that adjustment period?

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
The changing over.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
What was that like for you?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Having to start.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Being settled in a new life and things like that.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
It was very very different from there.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Totally different.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
First the snow was snowing.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
So it was so cold we never seen snow.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
But going through that we went to the camp.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
All the people who were there never bought.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
We became like families.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
But they had school in the camp as well.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Everything was provided in the doctor.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Everything.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
It was just like a little shopping.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
You know like your own camp with everything.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Facilities in there.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
We had entertainments.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
They used to take us out on the day trips.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
They gave us a lot and they did a lot for us.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
So going through that it was giving us a happy moment.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Because we had never seen that over there.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Especially our family you know.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And though my dad was not there so we were happy.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And we were happy.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
And we were happy.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And though my dad was not there so these people were looking after us as well.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
So the experience was coming good.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
But after settling in Pontypridd it was hard.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Because we were in a community where there was no Asians or anybody.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
In a Welsh community.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And in the beginning we had a hard time.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
But after I started working they all became my friends.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And everybody knew you because it was a small village there.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
So that was keeping us happy then.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And what would you say was your favourite memory from that time?

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
My favourite memory?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Because you were not married and you were just free.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And you had friends.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
You did so many things together.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Committed to anything.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And that was happy moments isn't it?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
You were free then isn't it?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Yes.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000
What would you say was the most important thing that you had to leave behind?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
In Africa?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Yeah.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
The most important thing was because over there the lifestyle was different.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Even though you didn't have much but you were happy.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Sometimes the family used to take you on picnics and things which we were looking forward to there.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And it was nice.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Food wise you had your own.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
The food we ate there was nice, fresh.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And it was different from here.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
When we came first we missed all that.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Because it was totally different.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
It was good times as well and bad times.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
So what about the culture as well?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
What was the culture and your practice of the culture?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Here?

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
In the beginning it was hard.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
But the thing is when we were living, staying there because we knew there were no Asians.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
So we had to adapt to wear English clothes as well.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
When you go to work you can wear your own clothes.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Because you'll be an old one out.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
You had to start adapting to it.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
But we still kept our culture.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Till now I try to keep my culture.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
But the children, they do half.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
How were you able to keep your culture?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
What things were you doing?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:46.000
When there's an occasion, or when there's respect for the elders.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Or if there's a death they must go and respect.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
This is all our culture.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000
You can sit with them and make some time and sympathize with them.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
They're emotional.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Don't forget your culture.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Keep your culture going with your food specially.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Your language.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
It's number one.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
It happened with my children.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
My mother-in-law showed that my children had to have the mother tongue.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
No English was allowed.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Where now my grandchildren don't even speak our language.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Because they speak English.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
The parents are English speaking to the kids.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Which we don't like it.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
We're not happy.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
But these days you can't say nothing to them.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
You try to guide them the right way.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
When you come to your religion, you guide them to keep your religion.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Don't go off to track.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Don't change into yourself too westernized.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Because I'm open minded.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
So we leave it to half and half.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And don't push them too much.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000
But I still want them to carry on with little bit which we got in our culture.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
You know.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Like we have our festivals and things.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
They should know about it.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
And on that day we must get together.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And share food and all that.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
If you didn't remind them, they'll know about it.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Because there's so many other distractions now that can really deter away the people.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And most of the time they're in school.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
They live in school more than.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And work.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
They're only in the evening for a little short time.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
We still live in Ponty Prid.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
No, I live in Newport.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
I moved in Newport in 1976.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
And then my son was born in 1977.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
I got married and moved here in 1977.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Then I had my first son.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And I've been since I'm in Newport.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Can you tell us about that time moving to Newport?

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Newport, yeah it was hard.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Because when my husband and their family come from.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
They're originally cousins.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
My mum's cousins they were.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Me and my husband are distant cousins.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Because we can marry with cousins that time.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
But now the kids won't have it.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
They said they're my brother or my sister.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
But we were really close.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And we were really close.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
But then the kids won't have it.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
They said they're my brother or my sister.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
But that time when I got married to my husband.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
They were living in one room.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
In somebody's house.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
We had two rooms already.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
My in-laws were staying in one room.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Me and my husband were living in one room.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
So we seen a hardship.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Because he came as well after.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Before we got married.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
He didn't have a job or anything.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And we were only about 18.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And we had to see very hardship.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
We both had to work.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And...

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Sometimes he didn't have much food.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Because he didn't have much money.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Because the wage was only nine pounds then.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And we didn't have nothing.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
We had to start from the scratch.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Going through difficulty.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Afterwards, Mother-in-law was collecting money for us.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
She supported us.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And then we bought a house after a long time.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
A unity.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
And then the family had a unity.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
This time they haven't.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
You don't even know what your son or daughter earns.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
When they have a wage.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
You can't even ask them.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Because times have changed now.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
But our time, we had to bring a wage.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And give Mother-in-law the money in Iran.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Because I was kept into the culture.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And respect.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
But she was doing good for us.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Because she was collecting money for us to have a property.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
So we worked very, very hard to reach here.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Not well, well off.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
But we are comfortable.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Exactly.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Can you speak about certain jobs?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Is there certain jobs that you've had that you've enjoyed as well?

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
What might have been a new point?

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
What would have been?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Well, before I was working in the supermarkets.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Which was my favourite.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Because I loved talking to people.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
I had a lot of friends.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
But then when I got married I had to come to Newport.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And then start in a sewing factory.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
It was a hard time.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Because it was all white.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And I was only Asian.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And because I had little experience from Conti Pits.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Because that was a white area.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
So I'm blending alright with them.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
I kept my limit.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
But I had to blend in with them.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
To keep me going.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Otherwise if I didn't I'd be in one corner.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
But then you always find one or two.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Which was very nasty people.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
But we survived.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
So since then I just worked in the sewing factories.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Till 1990.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
And then where did you go?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Then I finished because I had to look after my mother-in-law.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Who looked after us.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
And she's become ill for eight years.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
So I had to look after her then.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
You were talking about kind of even the money aspect of when we were working.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
And you were giving it to your mother-in-law.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
And then that was helping you in terms of building the house.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
How important is that?

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
And what ways can we...

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Is there certain ways that we can start getting back to that in a way?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
It was very good because I was very happy to be able to help my mother-in-law.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
And I was very happy to be able to help her.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
And she was very kind.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
And she was very nice.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
And she was very kind.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
And she was very nice.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
And she was very kind.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
It was very good because that time you had the limit of spending money as well.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Because instead of a bank, it was collected for you, for your future.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
You know, like she was putting her money, my husband was putting mine.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Like going in a little money box or wherever.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
So that was very important.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
If we didn't do that, we wouldn't have a house now.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
We would spend and spend.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
And we wouldn't have been in a council house or something.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Because we did get in a council house.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
From after we got married, we had one boy.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
And because the condition of the house was very bad, they put us in an old way.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
And it was a big, beautiful four bedroom house.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
For four people.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
We could have stayed there all our life, but we didn't want that lifestyle.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
We wanted to work hard and have your own property to stay in.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Nobody will check you out or anything.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Because all the days are rough, all the way.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
So that's why it helped us, you know, having a unity.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
But we wish that unity was still there.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
But everybody got their own mind now.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Because they've been grown up in this country and they...

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Back home, we used to have a lot of money.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
But we didn't have a lot of money.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
So we had to work hard.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
And we had to work hard.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
And we had to work hard.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
And we had to work hard.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
We were grown up in this country and they...

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Back home, we used to do the same, I think.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Parents were in charge and they always thought good things for your children.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
And we were much more connected.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Connected with each other.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
But that connection is not the same like...

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
I agree.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
So speaking about kind of connection, can you speak more about your connection to kind of age alive as well?

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Yeah. Since I got connected to age alive, there was only a handful of people.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
But we recruit...

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Because it was a multi-BME group.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
And we had to have all cultures which we liked.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
So we recruited people and brought them to the group.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Me and my sister, we gave a lot of time.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
In the beginning, this lot was not even there.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
It was only a handful.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
And when you see anybody on the road with a smile, you say,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Hello, would you like to come in and join our group?

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
It's a lovely group. Get you out of the house.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Come and join. Come and see what it's like.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
And through that, people started coming.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
So you see our group is multicultural.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:46.000
And when I started going to Shalom, I told them about it because they were all Jamaican people there.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
So I brought them here as well.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
I put my heart deep into age alive.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Until today, we took all the commitments to let it run.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
And it's just part of my family.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Age alive is...

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Thank you.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:15.000
How do you think age alive has supported other black, Asian, minority or majority groups?

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
It helped them come out of their houses.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Most of them were housewives, I think Asian culture ones.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Pushed them to come to the group, have the enjoyment, have the exercise and this and that.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
And they started enjoying all that.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
So they're looking forward once a week to go to the group.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
And that's a big day for them.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:48.000
And everybody look forward to see each other on Wednesdays.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Go on the trips, which they all love.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
So that kept us all together.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
And we hope that carries on and continues in the future.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:08.000
And the last question is, have you got any kind of memorabilia, which is any photos and things like that, that you'd like to share?

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Photos from where?

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
From whether you're younger or with family or any of the experiences that we spoke about.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Or even your first times in age alive?

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Yeah.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
If anything like that that you'd like to share.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
I'd love to have a look for photos from I think age alive.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
The good times we were having when we were going on trips and all year in there.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
We were all big groups that time.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:38.000
And a few of the friends passed away from age alive, which I miss them terribly.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Especially my friend who went to the Navy.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
We had a lot of connection, so much connection, till she died.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
You can still see her.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Good old memories.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Is there anything else that you'd like to share?

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
That's all.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
Well done to Roy, he keeps us going.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Till the last moment, we pray for him.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
He's the only one keeping us going, one man with all the women.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Thank you very much.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Thank you.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
But other language might be a bit awkward for me.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Like my language or the... Can I just leave it to English?

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Yes, yes you can.
