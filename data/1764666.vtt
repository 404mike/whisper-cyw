WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
But all you've got is my screen share.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.280
Okay so if you un-screen share it.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.240
Oh god how do I?

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.120
No I...

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.160
Is it gone now?

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.800
Yep all good.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.760
Okay well we're recording at the moment let's just take it while we share.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.320
We'll edit that bit out.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.080
Please do.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.640
So let's start with the formal stuff.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:40.480
So if you could just introduce yourself, tell us where you are, how old you are and the date today.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.920
Okay so my name is Sami Vali.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:56.640
I am 28 years old and I'm currently in Abergavenny at my parents house and the date is the 28th of September and we're in 2020.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:04.960
And I'm Anna Sosiecki, work for Mencap Cymru and I'm at home in Cardiff.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:14.640
So we have got together today to have a little chat and revisit I guess.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.080
I know originally you did your interview with Emily.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:33.760
So we will chat a bit about Emily but it would be good to kind of guess the main focuses around this last few months and how that's impacted you and particularly your friendships and relationships.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:41.120
So if we start maybe by thinking back to maybe towards the end of February and the build up.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.800
Right yeah.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.880
What was that like for you? Can you describe the sort of run up to things?

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.000
I was really, well for me to begin with I was just, I didn't really take it seriously.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.680
Like people around me were saying oh this is going to happen and we're going to have this worldwide thing and you know and I just thought no I don't see it myself.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:10.080
And then slowly slowly things started to change and I thought hmm maybe I should start taking things more seriously but I just couldn't.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.720
My brain wouldn't allow me to accept the change that was happening even though I knew it was going to happen and I knew I'd have to adjust.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.640
At that moment in time because nobody seemed to panic or everybody around me seemed to panic except for me.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:32.160
I was a bit like should I be panicked and I thought but then if I start panicking I'm only adding to what's already there and people would ask me why are you not panicking?

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.240
Why are you not panicked buying? I said because I don't need to.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.760
I said I don't feel we're at that point where we need to start panicking about what's going on.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:50.560
I think it really did hit me once we sort of got to start a march and they were like and everything's shut.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:03:06.240
And it was strange it was almost like momentarily in my head the world had stopped because everything I'd strive to have and achieve in my life had almost been put on hold.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.000
I was like I don't know what I'm going to do because I dance eight to ten hours a week.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.560
I do loads of other things and then all of a sudden to be told you can't even go out of your local area was a real shock really.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:31.680
But I mean yeah the run-up to it was strange because in my head I didn't want it to happen or in my head I didn't want it to happen as quick as it did.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:40.240
And then there was like I spoke to someone who's close to me, well it was my dance teacher in fact, and she was the same.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.760
She says I can't wrap my head around why people are panicking and I said to her maybe it's just me and you.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:53.440
And we'd laugh and joke about the fact, not joke about what was going on, we'd joke about the fact that we were so laid back and the rest of the world was in this panic-stricken.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:02.000
And then suddenly we just kind of went now we understand why but it's because we were just like oh when it happens it happens.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:12.880
But I think people were preempting the worst before it actually happened so already people were getting anxious about what was going to happen.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:22.640
Whereas naturally you'd think it would make me really anxious too but in a weird way I couldn't be anxious about something that wasn't real.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.360
Like it hadn't happened, there was no lockdown. People around me were panicked by it yeah.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:39.280
But other than that I was just like well it's kind of, to me it was almost like when you go to shops at Christmas time people are manic around you because they want to get all the pre-

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:47.040
To me nothing, it didn't really signal to me anything was wrong in the world at that moment in time so I was just kind of you know quite relaxed about it.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:58.640
But when it hit it hit with full force then because then I was a bit like I almost felt that I didn't get any pre-warning because although other people were panicking and I wasn't and maybe I should have been.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:11.840
It was kind of strange then to then suddenly be like well no it is real and then I was kind of frustrated at why I didn't accept it was real sooner because then it would have been less of a shock and less of an impact.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.520
But just have to kind of go with it really.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.320
Do you usually live in your own flat independently?

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.820
I do.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.400
How has that changed then?

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:34.400
It's changed massively in the fact that if I'm being honest I'm currently not living at my own house, I'm living very much at my parents.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:44.960
I do go to check my flat and make sure everything's alright, pick up the post, do things that sort of make to make people aware that I haven't just completely left it abandoned.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:54.400
But it was more a case of when all the lockdowns came in I said to my mum I can't be on my own, I don't want you to be on your own because I had no internet.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:17.760
Although I had a TV and I had people around me I had no internet and internet has become a massive part of how we communicate now so I'm like if I had been at home and there was no way of me getting to my parents I genuinely have no idea what I'd have done because other than phoning up somebody I would have been completely cut off from the world completely.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:30.640
Other than the fact that people could talk to me on the phone I wouldn't be able to see them virtually because I wouldn't have, well I do have data on my phone but I wouldn't have been nowhere near enough for me to do what I do now.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:44.880
And so yeah it was a bit of a shock because obviously coming down to my parents it was a bit stressful because suddenly my dad who works four days a week was suddenly working from home.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:07:06.080
As well as myself having to keep up my men cat work and my other job because neither of them were furlough which was good in a way because it gave me something to focus on but in a way it was quite stressful because dad and I were having to make sure we were in opposite ends of the house otherwise we'd hear each other's conversation.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:35.440
And it just particularly as he was having to record quite a lot of his meetings so he was like it wasn't until they played it back all they could hear was me in the background talking about my work and they were like oh dad was like well we were in different rooms of the house but the house is not majorly big in terms of even if we went upstairs and then again the internet is not great because we're the furthest away from the internet box where we live so it's kind of hit and miss as to who whose call goes because usually if two of us are on a call

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.000
at the same time one would cut the other out so it was kind of working out who's more important.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:57.280
So yeah I'm hoping to go back up into my place at some point but the the fact that the world is so uncertain doesn't make me at the moment doesn't make me feel that going back is the right thing and I'm still trying to look for a place to live in Abercadene.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:07.680
I haven't found one on the council yet even though there have been many properties on the council I still haven't found one but hopefully fingers crossed it won't be too much longer.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.680
Four years.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.880
Your independence and how was it kind of coming back to your family home?

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:45.280
Your family is your family you know you love them no matter what although I will say it was a bit of a shock for all of us because I had developed my own way of doing things and then also then of course because I moved back into my parents I pretty much had the contents of a flat in someone else's house.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:09:14.560
My mum was like you can't bring all your stuff here I don't have the space you know yes you've got your flat but you can't so I had to limit what I was bringing with me and also the room I have at my home is a box room and I'm used to a double bedroom so the space issue there was was quite interesting but yeah I mean it has been stressful at times because mum isn't working because she's not able to work but she still does all her

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:22.880
stuff online so she does quite a lot of zoom meetings and things so that's interesting when you've got a three-way thing going quite often there's three of us on three different laptops

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.200
trying luckily now we have three headsets we didn't have three headsets at the time so somebody would always have to make sure they were well out of the way

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.680
so that they couldn't be heard in another room so we were having to try and make sure we were

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:43.200
because you couldn't be in the same room with three of you doing three different things of course then the internet would struggle so ultimately somebody would somebody's call would drop

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.280
so it was quite it was quite difficult now it's sort of settled down because dad is back at work

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.800
so for us the family dynamic has changed again because it's meant that it's made it easier

00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:00.080
him being at work because he's quite him being at home was quite stressful because he's very set in

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:07.440
his ways he's very has to do things at a certain time in a certain way and the fact that even though I was living there

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:23.920
he in his head it's and yes I'm family but it's his house so therefore his priorities are the same mine and I'm like I get that but we need to kind of be a bit fair in the fact that I didn't ask for this to happen in the world nobody did but you know

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:33.600
yeah it's been it's been quite a shock but at the same time things have sort of settled back down again now that he is back at work and it makes it a lot easier

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.560
for me and mum because we are able to separate if we've got calls we're able to separate because

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:48.080
I haven't got dad on the big computer so yeah. And how about friendships then so I know you're really

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:55.680
busy part of lots of groups and things like that how maybe if we focus first on

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.760
the friends in groups and then those more sort of personal closer friendships

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:12.720
yeah I mean I'm lucky in a way that because of my job a lot of because of my

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.640
job I have now I before I was employed by them I was already friends with people that were that were

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:26.640
there before I became employed so I've been very lucky in the fact that we have zoom because that's

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:34.880
been zoom has been our main form of contact. Can you just explain what that job is then?

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:40.400
Just yeah so my job is I'm a sessional worker for building bridges so I work

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:47.120
with the young people and their families all the way from the age of eight right up to the age of

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:54.560
adult some people are on the project older than myself and so I'm basically my job is one that

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.400
if they need me to they'll they'll ask me if they need me to work so things I've done over the

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:06.480
lockdown are so I've done a tie-dye t-shirt video so I've uploaded about 15 16 different craft videos

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:12.640
I started one just as a bit of fun that took off and it was it was a thousand ways for toilet roll

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.600
tubes because at the start I made this joke that everybody's going to have a toilet roll tube

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.640
because there's none in the there's no toilet rolls in the shop and that was right at the start and

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:26.800
people thought it was hilarious so I was doing all these different craft things. Just very recently

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:33.440
we've had our first face-to-face activity that was a yoga session which was lovely we had it was a

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:39.280
very small number because a lot of people are actually too frightened to come out it's gone

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.800
the other way all these people that we encourage out of their houses have now gone completely

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:49.760
opposite way and so a lot of a lot 95 percent of the work I'm doing is online at the moment with

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:57.360
with that job so yeah in terms of friendship groups with with that it's been predominantly

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:04.080
through zoom or phone calls really but if it hadn't have been for the fact of the internet

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.520
we wouldn't be able to do what we I wouldn't be able to contact people in the way I have

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:15.200
it has proved it has proved challenging because some people don't like using the internet they

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.000
don't like it they're too frightened or they don't and we have you know and there have been

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.760
cases where people have not come on so that their communication is all over the phone or some people

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:28.560
are over email because they don't that's their form or texting is their form of communication so

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:36.240
it's an interesting it's interesting how do you find zoom in terms of maintaining contact with

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:47.200
people and like sort of front with friends and zooms great however it's only great if one of you

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:54.080
and your friendship group can afford to have paid for the premium because the problem is and

00:13:54.080 --> 00:14:00.160
I mean me and the groups of people I talk to we can talk and so 40 minutes feels like 10 minutes

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.000
and it's gone and I'm like and I have to tell them I'm going it's counting down it's going to kick

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.480
us out and we can restart a meeting the meeting again but then you kind of lose the flow of where

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:15.360
you are so it kind of yeah I mean zoom has been really helpful and I've been lucky in that most

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:21.520
of my zoom calls with groups of people that I have been speaking to have been done through work so

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.480
therefore work have a premiums account so it's not quite as bad so we can just kind of set it up and

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:33.360
kind of go you know talk to we've we've had enough really so and so have you been able to use that

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:42.880
work kind of function for more personal connection not for personal I have my own zoom account but I

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:48.800
have the basics so I can I can contact somebody and do a 40 minute call if I wanted to but

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:55.280
nine times out of ten some of the times if I'm for closer friends it's whatsapp video calls

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.920
rather than zoom because you're it's unlimited then and it's on your phone because quite often

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.480
if I'm on the phone to a friend it might I might be outdoors in which I use my own wi-fi

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:12.000
and my own insets so then I can walk and talk and do things that way so yeah more often than not if

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.680
it's personal I don't zoom tends to be more work-based for me than personal but I have done one or

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:25.040
two like a friend of mine wanted to do a workout I mean I'm the last person that I yeah I'll dance

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.360
but um she wanted me to make up some kind of workout so I just stuck some music on and

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.160
moved about but we did that over zoom because the quality was better and because I had the laptop

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:39.520
it was easier but other than that I tend to use what uh whatsapp really for my video calls

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:47.520
so with um closer friends then also that more personal contact um are there lots of people

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.280
that you've been staying in touch with or is it just one or two friends or how's that been have

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:58.640
you and Emily been in touch? No this is the thing sadly as well as connecting me to my friends

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:04.880
I've also mine mine and Emily's friendship sadly has phased out to a point where we haven't been

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:11.760
in contact since well the last time I physically saw her face to face was probably it was the same

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:18.160
week we recorded with each other that was a lot yeah we haven't known yeah and it's not because

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:24.960
we haven't wanted to see each other it's you know how it is your life's change things move on you

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:32.080
don't always stay with the same person and I know Emily's been through a lot and things have happened

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.840
her life has changed and things like that because she's not been involved in our

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.640
Bridges stuff for quite some time now but

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:46.080
so you're still in contact really at all? Not really at all I do have her number and on you know

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:51.200
a while ago I was saying you know hi how are you but I wasn't getting any response and even

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.560
though I spoke to work in the work capacity to find out if everything was all right with her

00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:00.480
um they just sort of said yeah as far as we're aware but I think it's just one of those

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:06.640
friendships change and your life changes and you move on and you lose friends and you make friends

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:13.360
and I think the pandemic has done exactly that for me it's brought me closer to people but it's also

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:19.920
took me away from people because I know that Emily wouldn't want to do zoom it's not that kind of

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:25.920
thing and I know that if I rang the conversation that we had would be very stop start because we've

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.880
disconnected now so we haven't had that reconnect properly and for us the reconnect would be

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:36.080
something face to face and it just it wouldn't at the moment in this moment in time it wouldn't

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:44.480
be right it wouldn't happen properly so for us it's kind of and sadly I mean as much as I've tried

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:50.640
to make contact she hasn't made contact with me either and I know it's difficult and I'm not

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:57.200
saying either of us are to blame for anything that's happened but you have to meet in you have

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.120
to meet in the middle somewhere and you know if neither of you are kind of communicating to each

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:06.800
other then it kind of spells that what you had was great but you've moved on and you know you have

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:13.840
to accept that and so at the moment we are I would pretty much say although Emily might have a

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:18.560
different view I'd still say she's a friend of mine because I know her but I haven't seen her

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.440
you know it's one of those that if I was to rock up to her house and say hello to her she'd

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.200
probably say hello but we wouldn't probably wouldn't hang out it's that kind of we're more

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:35.680
acquaintances now than we were friends so you said that in some ways it's brought you

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:43.200
you've connected better with some people during this yeah yeah about that then well my one of my

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:51.680
friends she lives in Derby and has done for the past sort of a year maybe two years and when the

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:59.040
lockdown hit we we've done a lot of video calls now because we used to do just you know just normal

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.200
phone calls but we like the fact that we could see each other and sort of talk that way so it's

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:10.080
brought us closer I mean we have seen each other face to face but that was just that was ages ago

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:18.480
before all the lockdown came in in to effect but we were lucky that we had the video call because

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:23.360
then we were able to sort of so it did bring us closer in that way because distance then was meant

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:33.920
nothing you know but then it's yeah and equally my other friend who we're even closer she only lives

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:38.800
well because I'm an avocadedy she lives in Monmouth and we still do video call I mean we have done I

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:43.040
have visited her outdoors and done the distance thing you know and it's been it's been great but

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:52.080
we've been she'll video call me or phone call me and even though we're only sort of a very

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:57.280
we're only like 20 minutes away just the fact that we're still able to video call each other

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.160
it's really helped it kind of it has kept the friendship going because I think

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:09.840
for us it was for me and my very close friend the one the one that lives in Monmouth, Sophie

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:18.560
the difference for us I guess is we were seeing each other four to five times a week

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:24.640
and then suddenly we were seeing each other once a month and for us that was a massive shock because

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:30.080
we're that I mean we're that close we can she considers me family and I consider her family

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:35.440
that's just how it is I mean we're not like they they'll ask and so oh yeah no she's you know it's

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.120
that kind of thing that I'm family is just expected I could go to her house not even knock the door

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.080
just walk in and make a competition oh hi how are you you know and it'd just be

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:46.960
for us I think because my other friend who lives in Derby we're used to the distance

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:53.520
whereas Sophie and I were not and so it was yeah because I was doing all I mean I do see her

00:20:54.240 --> 00:21:00.400
I see her every day when I say that I mean when I do a dance classes they're on a Facebook live

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:05.760
so she can never see me or any of her members but I can see her so yes I'm seeing her but it's not

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:11.200
two-way like I can comment and I can type comments on the videos as they go in but it's not quite the

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:17.360
same as she's not able to talk she can talk back but she doesn't know necessarily that I'm talking

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.160
at the same time that makes sense because she'll read the comments but she'll read them after the

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:29.040
class because she can't do it at the same time but yeah it's been it it's been helpful to have

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:36.320
the internet and be able to communicate that way but it um yeah it's still a bit of a shock when

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:41.840
you realize how quick time goes till you see each other and we've been lucky and so far fingers

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:46.400
crossed we are still lucky in that we're still able to go to venues because I'll be seeing her in a bit

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:51.680
later on to do a class so face to face which is lovely because it isn't it's more attractive

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:58.400
because two-way then but yeah. How did you and Sophie get to know each other then and how long

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:05.120
have you known each other? So I Sophie and I have known each other for six years we've just had our

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:12.480
six years of friendship in April just gone and I I was incredibly lucky I met the only reason

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:19.200
I knew that Sophie even existed was the fact that her sister Rachel actually worked on the project

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:23.760
that I now work for that I'm now an employer for when I was a young person on the project

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:30.880
they um Rachel was a volunteer and she we'd gone I can't remember I was at some sort of activity

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:35.680
and at that point I wasn't great with with crowds of people and talking to people

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:41.520
and so I just kept myself to myself and she sort of came over and started talking to me

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.280
and asked how I was and I said yeah I'm good you know sort of side opening up and I thought

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.720
you know she you know she's come and sort of spoke to me and I thought we'll get on really well so

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:58.400
then after that aside I then said I was looking for a PA at the time and Rachel said oh I'd be

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.960
interested in doing some work for you so I said okay so we sort of went through all the legalities

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:10.240
you have to go through and all the formalities and stuff and we met we went out for um something to

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:15.440
eat and the drinking now because any she met me and I'm going to meet that I had no idea she had

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:21.760
she had a younger sister at all and we were just talking away and she said to me I have to you and

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.720
my younger sister have to meet and I said why is that because you're so like it's unreal it's like

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:31.520
you should have been it's like you should have been our third sister so it's the first time I've

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:36.400
met you but it's like we should have been because our sense of humour was the same what you what

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:43.840
annoys us is the same like we you know and um she'd shown me photos and things and that that was it

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:48.960
really and I commented I think on something on Facebook that Rachel had put up and I thanked her

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:54.960
for you know a nice nice time out and Sophie had seen the comment and said who is this person and

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.920
Rachel was like oh no Sophie's like have you just met them and she was like uh sorry

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:04.400
so have you known them for a long time she's like no I've just met her and Sophie was quite

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.360
taken aback because she was like oh it doesn't sound like it sounds like you're into the forever

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:11.520
and she was like no but that's just the kind of person she is she's very very friendly and you

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:17.840
know she I think you'd make good friends and that was it really um I for the first time ever had gone

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:23.200
out to the cinema with somebody that wasn't family my dad dropped me off in Raglan and Rachel and

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:28.320
Sophie met me and that was it it was in that moment in that car we've been we've been best friends and

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.440
ever since then that's how it's been you know we've been in the holidays together

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.280
So you've got a disability or autism?

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:46.560
Sophie is uh she's sight impaired she's registered blind and so um we I think the reason we got on

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:53.760
so so well is where I sometimes lack the sense of not necessarily danger but like sometimes my

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:59.360
my brain won't engage before I do something so like we could be out somewhere and I'll just be

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:07.040
like not not giving thought to much things whereas Sophie will so where where my brain

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:12.640
doesn't necessarily kick in Sophie helps me in that area whereas I then I then help her with

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:19.360
seeing things and you know she's very I will say one thing you would never know that she couldn't

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:25.200
see very well because I didn't even know in our friendship I had no idea until I think it was

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:31.200
about a month through months and a half into our friendship it must have been yeah it must have

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:36.720
been yeah good three weeks and it wasn't until she it wasn't until Sophie said it just never made

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:43.680
it never made a difference I think that's for us why it it has gone has kept we've kept it as close

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:49.280
as we haven't for as long as we have because it just it just it is what it is you know we

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:55.680
we get on with each other and yeah. So during this time you've been keeping in touch

00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:00.880
kind of on zoom but a lot of that's based around so she's involved with Dance Blast is she

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:06.160
in your dance group? No Sophie Sophie's self-employed so Sophie actually runs

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:12.480
dance classes she's actually my dance instructor okay this is where it's really interesting because

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:20.080
I when I met Sophie Sophie wasn't self-employed at that time she was she well I said she wasn't

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:26.320
self-employed Sophie and Rachel started up RS dance so they they were doing dance but it was

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:32.560
Rachel's thing at the time so Rachel had trained to do some fitnessy stuff and then Rachel went on

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.200
then and decided she didn't want to do it anymore and so Sophie took it over and it was then when

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:42.560
Sophie was doing that that she'd said to me oh I'm thinking of becoming a fit steps instructor

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:46.320
I said well what's fit steps and she said well it's born with Latin she said you know strictly

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.840
come dancing and I said yeah I know a bit of it is that kind of dancing you wouldn't need a partner

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:55.360
she said I'm gonna so I think this summer coming I'm gonna learn to do it and I said all right and

00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:02.480
that was she she'd learned to do it I think in the yeah she'd learned to do it over the summer

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:09.440
and then in the September so it literally was six months between me knowing Sophie to Sophie

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:14.320
becoming self-employed and becoming a fitness instructor there was a six month gap of me like

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.760
we'd only been friends six months then suddenly she becomes self-employed and achieved all of this

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:23.280
and I the nice thing was I'd seen it from from the box I'd seen it from the ground up so that was

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:27.840
what was was lovely about it but that's why it's an interesting spin on our friendship because those

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.360
I know that come to our classes know we're close friends but before that

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:37.680
like we'd be we'd be dancing or at the end like so could be like I've always said look if I'm

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:42.080
doing something that looks ridiculous tell me like show me how the arms went and because she's so

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:46.960
direct it we used to start and laugh out people would look at us as if she'd been really mean to

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:52.480
me but I was like no it's fine like we're really we're really close friends like we we banter all

00:27:52.480 --> 00:28:00.640
the time and we have inside jokes and stuff like chatting about or what's happening well normally

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:05.440
we're just having a cup of tea and putting the world to rights or we're just like quite often

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:09.920
she'll ask me how I've how I found the classes online because it's really difficult for her to

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:15.680
gauge how members are you know if they're enjoying it if they're finding some of it too

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:20.400
too quick or too much because you can't really she can't see us to know how we're doing

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:25.840
so quite often like on one occasion she's like I was trying to try something I was like okay

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:33.520
and so she'd put music on and she'd have me do the dance because she knows if I'm able to do it then

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:38.720
then I you know then she's taught it right if I'm able to pick it up so she's done that a few times

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:44.400
all the odd times she's like I'll ask her questions about a line dance that she's done because

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:49.280
the tricky thing with line dancing is when you get to the back wall Sophie's behind you so you

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:54.720
can't see her you've got to listen but I've been lucky in that when it has been at venues I'm on

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.960
the back wall anyway so I've been used to having to listen because people are following me I somehow

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:05.120
got the honour of being asked within two or three weeks of being there if I'd go on the back wall

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:10.000
so it meant that I had to know what I was doing because people were copying me but no we just talk

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:18.000
about anything really and quite often 95 percent of the time we never we made a point of not talking

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.200
about the world as it is now we would just talk about happy things and we reminisce over memories

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:29.120
and things we have done and you know and even now we we reminisce over things we you know the funny

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:36.640
things that have gone on in lockdown and you know we just we try and every everything we have in our

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:41.120
conversation is always a positive not you know sometimes there are going to be conversations we

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:45.520
have where one of us is feeling a bit down or whatever that's natural but nine times out of

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:51.840
ten we do try and keep positive about it because we both believe that what you put out will come

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:59.520
back so we try and be as positive as we can be so yeah yeah we do talk about lots of things but

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:07.600
always positive if we can. How have you been kind of emotionally during this time what how have you

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:15.520
kind of felt? It's kind of sound really odd emotions wise I feel I've become attached and

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:26.400
detached at the same time with my emotions like I realized it wasn't until I mean it's it's now I

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:34.080
joke about it but I didn't at the time because I didn't realize until I think it probably about

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:39.920
May time May June time I realized it I'd seen somebody in the supermarket who I knew quite well

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:46.720
and I suddenly started having this real panic internally because I was like I've lost the

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:50.800
ability to communicate with somebody face to face I genuinely had this panic of please don't say

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:56.320
hello or do say hello but I don't know how what so they said hello and I just I went hi and that

00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.720
was it and normally I'd be like hi how are you you know what we've been up to literally I managed

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:04.960
to get the words high out and I felt so embarrassed because they looked at me as if to say you're

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:09.600
going to say anymore and then before I knew it we'd gone our separate ways and we were

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:14.800
gone about the shopping but I was just like I realized I as well as the fact that

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:23.120
zoom and all this had brought me closer to people it almost took away my ability to communicate

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.920
face to face if that because although yes I'm face to face now because I'm talking to you and I can

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:33.920
see you it's not the same as if I was physically with somebody so the way I spent like I almost

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.680
made the anti-social because I was like I don't know like people say hello and I'm like I don't

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:45.440
know what to do with you like you're there but do I say hello what comes next almost like I've lost

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:51.600
it's almost as well as like the social cues are completely different when you're online to when

00:31:51.600 --> 00:32:00.240
you're face to face like when you're online you can't talk at the same time so it's not natural

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.240
like you have to wait for somebody to stop talking to get your word in whereas when you're talking

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:09.600
face to face the natural thing is you'll talk at the same time and you might talk over people and

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.040
but it's fine because you know what it's been said because it can happen at the same time

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:22.160
so yeah emotions wise I've been I've been okay there have been moments where I've not been but

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:25.280
but

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:41.920
two minutes so yeah it's been no it's right it's been my emotions have been it's been tough in a way of

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.080
it's been tough in a way of

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:59.360
it's really difficult because I don't think I've allowed myself to fully grieve for the way things

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:03.520
have been just because I'm the kind of person that's like no I don't want to grieve I want

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:09.520
to be happy and I want to be I mean I have had a few people say to me how can you be like like

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:16.560
I've seen them in the street and now because of work I've been it it's gone the other way now I'm

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:20.960
okay I'm able to talk to people because I'm doing more face to face and things it's gotten better

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:25.760
but I have had the occasion where I'm like I've gone the other way so whereas I wouldn't say

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.600
a lot of people I'm like hi how are you and like really cheerful and I've had a few times when

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:34.640
they've gone we're going through a pandemic how can you be you're too happy how can you be so

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:41.120
happy and I was like I'd rather be happy than be miserable because being miserable doesn't make the

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:45.680
situation won't get any better if you know I might as well try and be happy and take every

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:52.800
positive I can out of the situation and I just smile at people and I'm like I feel I feel for

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:58.800
them because I think you must be really struggling and feel really sad and feel really alone

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:04.800
if you think I'm too happy because this is just this is me I haven't been any more happy than I

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:12.880
usually am so I'm like yeah it kind of opens your eyes really to the fact that I think people

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:19.360
are less inclined to say how they feel now more than ever because they don't want to burden an

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:26.000
already heavy world so they kind of and I'm like I wish you'd speak because actually speak there's

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.440
nothing wrong with saying I'm not okay there's nothing wrong with saying saying that at all and

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:37.200
I mean I've kind of come full circle emotion-wise because I kind of went from where I was really

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:45.280
panicked but well I was really laid back then I went to this panic phase and I went through this

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:50.560
manic OCD phase as well that phase kind of gave me my hands were literally red raw I burnt my

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:56.560
hands pretty much because I was washing them that much and the taps were that I had the taps that

00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:01.120
hot and I was like you've burnt your hands and I said yeah but I need to wash them in a little

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:06.960
shorter point where I was washing them 20 30 times a day it was that bad at one point because

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.800
I was so panicked by the fact that everywhere you went it was a you must wash your hands and

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:16.320
it was really in your face so I was and then it kind of I still wash my hands but not I wash them

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:24.080
more than I should more than needs me but not as bad as I was and then communications gotten

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:30.640
better I've sort of relaxed a little bit and not got as panicked as I was and then I've tried to

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:38.480
help other people not be as panicked because my my work has almost helped in a way of I I'm in a

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:45.520
position with work where not that it's expected of me to cope but like I don't want others to feel

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:52.000
anxious because I'm anxious so I kind of try and find the positives and you know so yeah emotion

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.640
wise it's been it's been tough at times and it still is now and again I get moments where I'm like

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:03.520
you know can you know like I've learned now I'm living day to day and I know I'm already thinking

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:08.240
in my head I can see my phone I'm already thinking at half past one between half past one half past

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:12.720
two if the government hasn't said there are any restrictions I can go to a dance class tomorrow

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:18.640
because I've got to give you 24 hours notice so I'm still I'm still controlling in a way of like I

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:22.400
know exactly when the government posts out about restrictions because I've seen the times they get

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:27.920
posted but that's my own thing but other than that emotion wise I'm in a good place now

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:34.400
and I'm quite positive I'm quite happy and I'm quite I'm quite okay with the way things are but

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:41.600
the happy times where it's been really like there were times where because I was so unsure of the

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:48.160
world and so anxious and so kind of my emotions were really confused I was actually lashing out

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:51.520
with people and it was always those that were the closest to me and wanted to help me and wanted me

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:56.160
to be happy that I was doing that too and then I'd do it and then get really upset that I'd done

00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:01.920
it but I wasn't that wasn't the emotion I wasn't angry I was confused and lost and didn't know where

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:10.880
I stood but it came out as anger and that's not yeah but I guess you know we all go through the

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:14.720
emotions and I've come the other side now and it is it's one of those it's coming the other side

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:20.000
now but I don't know how long it'll be before it kind of goes round again so I have to wait and see

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:26.000
Do you have have you been able to talk to people have there been people that you've been able to

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:31.040
you know share the way you've been feeling with during this time?

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:37.600
Yeah I'm lucky in a way that mum and dad are quite open and will let me talk but obviously

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:42.800
you never really want to burden your parents but they I do talk to them and we do have conversations

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:49.680
and we're quite open about it but I'm also lucky that my closest friends are a great outlet for me

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:56.720
as well as they as I am for them you know quite often they'll go it's so unfair and like it

00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:03.840
sometimes for me it's it's the need to decompress at the end of the day like because there's so much

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:12.160
going on there's so much uncertainty and there's where as my anxiety would come and go there's a

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:17.360
steady anxiety now whereas I'd have moments where I'd almost be free of anxiety because I'd be like

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:26.080
oh you know this is how life is like excuse me pre-Covid I was I had I didn't always have anxiety

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:33.360
I would just have it now you know now and again whereas now there's always there's a there's an

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:38.080
anxiety that there's always like a baseline and then it either go up or it'll go down it'll never

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:44.400
stop and I think it's just because I the world isn't predictable like it used to be people aren't

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:48.800
predictable like they used to be all that predictability has been taken away so therefore

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:55.360
I have nothing to base anything on you know I just I'm just having to literally go oh well

00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:01.200
this is what's happened here and now I can't base anything on anything you know and I can't look at

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:07.200
people and know their emotion because quite often that's not their true emotion because nobody wants

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:13.120
to burden anybody else so whilst I'm trying to understand people and work it out because nobody's

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:18.400
being as definitive with their emotions like they're happy they're happy you know you know

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:25.600
whereas actually now people are happy but they're that that's not their emotion if you see what I

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:31.280
mean it's like people will be like oh yes I'm really happy yeah it's really difficult to

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:38.640
to know and more so than ever because now you've got to wear a face mask indoors I can't tell by

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:41.840
somebody just by looking at them what they're feeling and whether

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:46.640
my because I don't know whether what I've said has offended them or whether they're happy or

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:51.280
whether they're you know how they're feeling because I can't tell just by their eyes alone

00:39:51.920 --> 00:40:00.160
I mean I'm lucky in that some people that I do know they have got a degree in drama and theatre

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:05.200
and stuff like that so actually it's boded well because they can tell me through their eyes because

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:10.560
they they go over the top which works really well like I know if they're if they're bored

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:19.520
because they'll show me but yeah. And what about kind of work colleagues have you had support

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:27.440
through work or how has that been? Yeah absolutely I mean work on many levels has saved me

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:34.080
because they're always there for me they were on occasion they've asked me to do videos they've

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.960
always said if they've asked me to do a video they've said if you don't want to do it you don't

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:44.880
have to do it like there's no pressure to do anything and it is great I mean I've got

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:52.000
fingers crossed Sunday next Sunday Sunday the fourth supposed to be going on an outdoor

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.520
distance bike ride and picnic with QB which is the younger which is Quest Busters they're the younger

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:04.480
group they're eight to seventeen so I've been asked if I'll go there and say hi to the families

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:08.400
and just make myself known because a lot of the families don't know who I am because a lot of

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:14.560
them have only seen me over like a zoom call or something like I haven't really seen you face to

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:25.440
face but no I am so so lucky in the fact that my um my what you call it my line manager so to say

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:33.840
although we don't really use that word we just my um my point of contact is is Lisa and the great

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:38.480
thing about it is that a with children knows me really well and b I can ring her and just be like

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:44.960
this is going on and she'll be like it's fine we'll work through it so I as well as the fact that

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:52.400
I'm employed by them they're also very very aware that this time although it's

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:58.000
an anxiety broken time for many it's more so for something like me so they're very aware of that

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.440
and they'll always say like they'll ring in and check in on me or they'll send me a message say

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:05.680
how are you doing today you know how's it going and they've always said never be afraid to tell

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:10.880
us that you're having a hard time because that's when you need us most so just just tell us if

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:16.400
you're having a difficult time or if things are too much or if you're worried should not know and

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:21.920
should not know questions a silly question I'd rather you ask and then be able to tell you then

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:28.080
not know so yeah work's really really helped me to even to have employment in this house

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:33.040
think if I had no employment during this time I think I'd be lost because although dance is an

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:38.960
outlet I like having different people to talk to different faces and different things to do

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:50.880
so yes they've really helped and one of the things that we um chatted about last week was

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:55.600
about um sort of studio with dance and sort of physical contact is that something you've missed

00:42:55.600 --> 00:43:03.360
physical absolutely 100% I mean with dancing at the moment when you're in venues it's okay with

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:07.280
like Sophie's classes with Zumba and fit steps because you're not it's not contact anyway you're

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:12.800
just copying something but with my contemporary classes everything is contact based and we've

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:18.800
been told obviously none of what we do is to be caught so we're having to do things separate but

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:30.640
together but it it works but for me I'm such a contact person and we had to do a task for

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:35.120
when we went into our venue and that was to do she said oh there's three things in the room have a

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:39.920
look you know take any three things in your room describe them so I described them you know one

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.840
word for each thing in the room and then you had to do you had to translate that into a dance move

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:49.520
to three dances and put them together every single person that was on that zoom meeting

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:56.560
and in that room had a move that connected with themselves physically and it just it

00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:01.680
everybody realized when the videos were played back as we recorded it they said

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:06.720
doesn't that just go to show how much people are missing physical contact with another person and

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:12.000
I said well I didn't at first I didn't give a thought to it but it it really is I said to

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:18.560
people I said the thing with me is if I know you really really well like if you've your friends or

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:25.680
whatever my immediate thing is for hi how are you and to hug you that is my immediate response

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:30.720
and to not be able to do that I'm like it is really difficult because then I'm like

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:36.080
is there going to be a time where they go hugging is okay or is this it now we've lost the ability

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:40.000
to be able to hug each other period you know and in my head I'm like please tell me there comes a

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.000
point where they go it's safe you can hug somebody because I'm like I think god what's it being now

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:52.160
six months over six months you know and I mean yes I've hugged my mum and my dad but that's been it

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:58.000
I mean I haven't I haven't hugged my that's where I hugged my best friend was right at the start of

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.920
March so it's been six months and we all the time we're always high-fiving and hugging each other

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:09.920
and to not be able to do that we just we ear hug now we're like ear hug that's all you can do like

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:17.920
a thing but yeah it's strange it's strange to dance but not not do the contact bit when it's

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:24.880
contemporary but yeah it works we've made it work I know um back when we did the interview with you

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:33.920
and Emily you were single um are you you're not in a relationship at the moment absolutely not

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:42.000
that is the last of my things and to be quite honest I said this to somebody the other day

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.600
I don't know if I ever want to be in a relationship I quite like me myself and I know it sounds really

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:55.520
vain it's not that I I just I find guys really I know guys say we're confusing but I find them

00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:02.880
really confusing people because they they they think they think they're after simplicity they

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:07.760
want a simple life yeah they're the ones that confuse everything like I'm just like I don't

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:15.200
understand guys I just I understand obviously I understand but I mean like I just my life without

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:23.200
a guy I just it sounds awful but I don't have time to put a man in my relation within my world

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:28.720
because to me then I have to make time for that person and it sounds strange because yes I make

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:33.840
time for my friends but that's natural that's been six years it's a natural thing whereas

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:38.800
a relationship with a guy is the most unnatural thing in the world to me so I don't know if I

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:44.000
ever will have a relationship or whether I will have children of my own but I'm quite happy with

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.600
that at the moment like I don't I don't like my best friend Nathalie because she's in a relationship

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:56.720
has been for a little while now well coming up for a year I think um yeah yeah and she's asked me

00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:02.320
before now you know she's asked me much longer how do you feel about it and I said to be honest

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:08.640
I said I don't think I want a guy I said I don't know if I ever want to have a man I said because

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:16.320
in a strange way I said minus the children and things like that I said everything I want in the

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:24.080
guy she already gives me just not in a deep and emotional way if that makes sense like she gives

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:28.320
me the friendship she gives me the banter she gives me the closeness you know I don't

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:35.040
there's nothing that a guy would give me extra other than a children and be the emotional and

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:40.880
sexual side of things she you know Sophie gives me everything else why would I then want to add a man

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:47.280
into something that's already great like I don't yeah I don't know do you know you're not tempted

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:52.560
by the emotional and sexual side of things then it's not something that you feel no not really

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:56.560
I know well no because people go to me oh you don't know what you're missing and I'm like well

00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:00.400
that's like saying to somebody who can never eat ice cream always allergic to chocolate you don't

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:06.080
know what you're missing if you've never had it you're never going to know and they laugh I'm like

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:11.040
well if I've never been there and done it you're right I don't know what I'm missing so as much as

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:14.240
you keep saying you don't know what you're missing you're quite right I don't know what I'm missing

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:20.880
you feel okay with that absolutely I've never felt more free I'm not tied down to anything

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:27.600
I don't have to go home and answer to anybody I don't have to go go home and cook for a guy

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:31.440
I'm not saying every guy you know every woman cooks for a man but like I don't have to go home

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:36.320
and think about someone else it's not my mum my dad my brother you know I don't have to go and go

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:42.320
oh okay maybe I should contact you or you know maybe I should meet up with you there's none of

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:47.120
that I don't have to you know it's all yeah I don't know I've tried relationships a few times

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:55.280
and they've just they've just not worked for me fair enough so yeah so it's not like you've been

00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:02.320
kind of during this period um thinking about relationships or no because I've not been I've

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:10.480
not truly been lonely funnily enough not even like it's strange because you think I feel more

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:16.240
lonely because I'm not I'm seeing less of people but I feel I feel more connected to people now

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:23.520
than I did once didn't have any friends um when we were able to go and just go and hug somebody

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:28.000
and say hello now I feel more connected with the world than I've ever been and whether it's because

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:34.320
I've realised how lucky I am because I've been at that place where I've had nothing and now I have

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:38.880
everything and whether I've whether it's because it's all coming to perspective and I'm thinking

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:44.960
oh actually I have it pretty good right now you know I didn't have it good I have it pretty good

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:48.640
right now even though even though I'm seeing less of people I'm still I still have it good I could

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:59.200
have been in a way worse position you know so yeah. So finally in terms of like the um the practical

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:05.280
sides of all of these things like with all the rules and everything like that how have you found

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:15.520
kind of making sense of of some of that side of things? Well I um for me the rules have always

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:21.680
been they contradict every rule not every rule but most rules they make contradict themselves

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:27.840
because it's like you say one thing but you like I can't wrap my head around I understand

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:32.640
the economy is important but so are people you know people are more so important than

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:37.280
the economy but I know why they're doing things but they're saying you you know if you've got

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:47.120
restrictions you can't meet people any more than six people at a go um I'm sorry if you've got

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:51.440
restrictions you can't meet anybody you don't live with but yeah I can go down the local pub

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:56.880
as long as I'm out by 10 and I'm like I don't understand the logic I understand they're trying

00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:00.800
to keep the economy going and they want people to because what they're saying is we want people to

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:05.360
have that we want people to go to these places because people's mental health is suffering

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:11.680
because they're staying indoors I get that but by saying don't go and have people in your house that

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:16.880
you don't live with you're not eliminating the problem because the problem doesn't stem from

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:22.080
households the problem stems from people going into pubs and restaurants I said if you'd have

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:27.040
just kept it outdoors I know it's freezing cold now but even if you'd if people really wanted a

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:31.680
drink they'd wrap up you'd wear warm clothes you know if you really wanted to I mean I've not been

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:38.320
in the first time I went in a restaurant was in Temby just um just gone yesterday and what day

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:46.800
we'd say Monday not yesterday Saturday and I was petrified I'd never eaten I almost didn't digest

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:50.720
my food um and almost bought it straight back up because I was that anxious I was eating it that

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:55.920
quick because I wanted to get my face mask on because I was so petrified I said to mum what if

00:51:55.920 --> 00:52:00.320
we go home and they tell us I've been in contact with someone they said that's 14 days I've got to

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:05.360
not leave this house I said I can't do that I mean I would have to but like the the anxiety of being

00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:12.960
forced to stay in in your own four walls for for however many days was like but no the rules are

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:18.000
really I mean I have been lucky in a way and I know this person won't mind me mentioning

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:24.480
I've been so so lucky that Gwen and I have kept contact the way we have just through messages

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:30.000
literally as soon as there's an update even if it doesn't relate to me Gwen literally my phone will

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.880
go and I'll be like I can see it on the computer and I'm like any minute now and like it happens I

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:38.960
always get one and Gwen's like you don't need to worry this is what it means and it's great

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:42.560
because I don't I don't listen to any of the conferences because there's too much information

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:46.960
given out at the same time whereas Gwen will listen to all the conferences but will only tell

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:53.200
me things that will affect me whereas if it's not relevant to me she won't tell me because she's like

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:56.240
there's no need for me to tell you something that doesn't involve you so if it involves you

00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:01.200
I'll tell you so it's great because then I'm literally Gwen's now become my little messenger

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:05.760
of all things role related because then I'm like I don't need to worry no Gwen's like no you're

00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:10.320
fine you're good this is what you need to do to make sure you're you're safe and that's it you

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:17.760
know so I'm I am really lucky. How do you think other people have managed with that side of things?

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:22.960
I think other people have struggled because I think not everybody has I mean even my parents

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:27.600
don't understand it they're like have you got a Gwen update yet because they wait for me to

00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:32.160
like it's become a thing in our house they're like oh is there a Gwen update and I'm like and she knows

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:36.080
she thinks it's the sweetest thing ever and I'm like no no Gwen update yet and then I'm like oh

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:39.760
mum we've had an update because they mum and dad don't even watch the telling out to the news

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:44.000
because it's too confusing mum's like I don't understand what applies to us and what applies

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.960
to us and what doesn't so but I think for other people particularly those in my position those

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:54.160
with a learning disability that works with any additional need I think it's increasingly because

00:53:54.160 --> 00:54:00.960
nothing is easy read sit there and listen is is really hard because you don't and the big fancy

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:07.520
words and you know and I'm like just tell me you know what what is it exactly that I need to do

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:14.640
to make sure that I'm sticking with the rules here you know and and then I think

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:20.480
people like me are very easily drawn into the fact that yes I've got social media but social media

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:25.920
couldn't be a negative thing in a situation like this because I have seen so many people that have

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:31.680
gone oh how ridiculous is this and they're venting out things out but they don't realize that by

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:38.720
venting and trying to make justification of a rule that's been that's been put there anybody else

00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:43.600
seen that they you know for the likes of me I'm like I don't know why you're trying the rules there

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:47.040
the rules there don't try and make sense of it because you won't make sense of it none of it

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:51.520
makes sense I don't even think those that made the rules fully understand what sense can make

00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:55.440
sense and if you've asked them and said where's the common sense in it they wouldn't be able to

00:54:55.440 --> 00:55:01.520
tell you because they're trying at the same time people don't realize yeah okay you know I'm not

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:05.680
pinning blame on anybody but you've got to realize they're learning at the same time people that are

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:10.080
governing the world have never had to govern it in quite the way they are now you know so I'm just

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.560
it makes me laugh people go oh what's the point it's ridiculous I might as well go down the

00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:18.480
pub and get plastered and I'm like get down the pub and get plastered everyone they haven't stopped

00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:24.160
you what they're saying is on your head be it you know ideally don't go you know they're not you

00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:28.000
know that's what they're saying in the grand scheme of things don't go to these places I mean

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:34.160
I haven't been to a pub since I think it's February last I went to a pub February

00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:39.760
um and I don't intend going anytime soon I mean we're supposed to go with my best friend

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:47.680
was to go to Cardiff on the 10th of October but that's not happening I mean if I'm honest I don't

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:55.200
I still it baffles me how mom should have kept their head above water so yeah so far where's

00:55:55.200 --> 00:56:00.400
the word yes there because I think you know I'm waiting it's only a matter of time I think it's

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:06.160
not a matter of when it's it's not a matter of if it's a matter of when but you know just see

00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:13.040
what happens and go from there really take it day by day it's all you can do is there anything else

00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:18.320
that you would want to say about I guess the past few months that you would want people to know about

00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:25.920
you know your experiences over the past few months I think the main thing I want people to

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:30.720
take from this or those that are listening to this is you know whether that be now whether this

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:37.760
be in years to come although it's been a tough time it's never not been all negative there have

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:42.800
been positives we are we will get through this you know yes we're writing history at the moment

00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:49.920
this is you know a big part of history in the making but there are positive communities are

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:54.720
coming together people are things are moving along you know it's not been it's never been

00:56:55.280 --> 00:57:00.240
a case of it's going to end the world it isn't yes it's changed but I just want people to know

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:07.600
it's not forever although it feels like it now and it's difficult nothing nothing is nothing is

00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:12.800
forever you know and tomorrow's never tomorrow's never promised you never promise tomorrow just

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:19.680
take it day by day and go I got up this morning great you know that's in itself you know is a

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:25.440
massive thing don't think you know I see people now that go oh god what's gonna happen what's

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:29.600
gonna happen next week what's gonna happen you know in my head it's like what's gonna happen

00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:35.360
tomorrow you know I don't go as far ahead as to all I know now is I'm able to go and do a dance

00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:39.440
class today great I don't know if I'll be able to go and do one tomorrow whether it'll be on

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:45.600
zoom I'll cross that bridge when it comes to it but just just take day by day and make the most

00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:50.000
make the most of it fine because I always say to people not every day is a good day but there's

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.800
good in every day and even if it means that you write one thing down it might be something like

00:57:54.800 --> 00:58:00.640
you know you're really proud of some uh a meal that you made today or you're really proud of

00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:05.440
the fact that you went to the shop and you got something write that down and then come the new

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:10.880
year you can see every all the things you achieved in the year that's just gone because it it's

00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:15.760
really helpful for people to see that things can still be achieved and it's the small things people

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:21.760
take for granted that now are the huge things because people go oh yeah uh you know I've made

00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:25.920
that you might not think twice about something that you've cooked but now the fact that you went

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:28.800
out and got the stuff and you came back and you cooked it's a huge thing because you've been out

00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:33.360
to the shops where you may not have felt safe you've come back you've cooked something you know

00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:39.920
you've put something on the table it's all about the small things now are what are what have now

00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:45.040
become the big things and take nothing take nothing for granted because you do not know when

00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:52.000
that will be the last of something you know just take every moment take you know tell those that

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.760
I've processed you tell them tell them you love them tell them how important and how much they

00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:58.000
appreciate you because you don't know when that's going to be the last time you're going to be able

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:04.800
to do that so just take every day as it comes tell people you love them and just enjoy and be in the

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:09.360
moment be in the here and the now don't worry about tomorrow tomorrow will be what will be will be

00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:14.880
just being here in the now you know and that's all I can say to people you know just enjoy

00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:20.000
what you have don't worry about what you don't have because you can't change that just enjoy

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:28.960
what you have and what you could have so yeah great thank you Sami I'm gonna stop record
