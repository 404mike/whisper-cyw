My name is Gwyneth Price. I came to live in Langaneda in 1960 when I married a local boy whose family had farmed in Langaneda for a good many years.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We didn't marry in Langaneda as I had lived in Abergavenny. I have been a member of our church for over 40 years.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:45.000
One of our daughters was married in the church in 1985. Our other daughter, when she was young, was in the church choir when after a wedding they would rush out to put a rope across the litch gate and they wouldn't let the bride and groom go through until the best man threw money for the local children to pick up. Then they would drop the rope.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:03.000
When I first came to Langaneda the minister was Harry Lewis who spent a lot of time visiting members of the church as he lived here at the rectory. After he retired the rectory was sold. The minister no longer lived in the village so you didn't see so much of them.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The church then shared a minister with Langatog and he lived there. The next minister was the Reverend Bill Lewis, then came Robert Patterson, then Tudor Griffiths and then Kelvin Richards.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I think the restoration work on the litch gate has enhanced and improved the entrance to our lovely church and we'll be here for the next generation to see.
