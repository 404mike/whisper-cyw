Steve's Stories

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
My name is Steve Fletcher

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and in 1990 I founded Swicker Carnival

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
who have organised Cardiff Carnival ever since.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Steve's Story Number 5

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Cardiff Carnival Come Rain or Shine

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I want to let you in on a secret.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It has been known to rain here in Cardiff, occasionally.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Devotees of Cardiff Carnival like to describe it as being weatherproof.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
What they are referring to is the phenomenon whereby,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
after three weeks of increasingly pressurised costume production and dance rehearsals,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that something uniquely special happens on Carnival Day itself.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
All the interviewees for Cardiff Carnival's online archive,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
recorded for this Heritage Lottery Fund project,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
still speak with passion of how their spirits rose on the big day of the Carnival parade itself.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Whilst many Cardiff Carnival parades have enjoyed sunshine,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
more than a few have taken place in damp and, upon occasion, deluge conditions.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The first of these was a downpour as the parade passed St David's Hall in the haze in 1991.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
One man then showed us all how the true carnivalist reacts to torrential rain.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Drum tutor Sam Alexander

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Sam was leading the 50-strong Maracatu drumming group with dance sections four and aft,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
as the heavens opened big time.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Sam's response was to start pogoing up and down like a crazed punk rocker, while bellowing,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Go higher, go higher!

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
His drummers responded to his carnival mania, and as his group's rhythm intensified,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
their drumming doubled in speed.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Inspired by Sam and the even faster, thunderous tempo of the drums,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
the entire parade seemed to find untapped energy,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and we quite literally steamed the rain-soaked length of the haze.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Moreover, our audience stayed with us throughout, dripping wet but cheering wildly,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and not running for shelter as would normally be the case.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
In my opinion, the worst ever torrential rain was during Cardiff Carnival 2005.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I still smile when thinking about how the rain was so intense from start to finish

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
that in order to ensure our body painted blue devils stayed blue,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
they had to be accompanied by teams carrying buckets of paint to slosh on them every few minutes

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
as another coating was washed off.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
This just goes to prove that not even a full-on dark deluge can stop the Cardiff Carnival on parade.
