00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040
This is Vicki MacDonald speaking from Holy Trinity Church, Flandersnow, during

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.720
the longest yarn and I'm with Linda Wainwright who's going to tell us about

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:17.000
her family during the war. Sorry about the noise, thank you Linda, let's go.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.760
Anything you want to tell me?

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.640
My parents, my grandparents, were actually killed during the war.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:34.160
They lived in Ancoats in Manchester and a bomb, a stray bomb, was dropped and went into the garden

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:43.600
of their house and under the floor of the house and exploded. My grandmother and grandfather who were

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:57.440
Harriet and Edward Walton were killed outright. My aunt who was Miriam Walton and was about 18,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.600
had the fire, she was sat by the fire, the fire blew out onto her and badly burned her from the

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:13.680
waist down. She survived two weeks in hospital. My dad, Edward Walton, he was mending his bike

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.960
and the bike fell on top of him and stopped the rubble from crushing him. He spent a good six

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:28.520
weeks in hospital and ever afterwards his toes were all crunched up because they'd obviously been

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:36.120
affected by the rubble falling on him. He also, he then went to live with his grandmother,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.360
his grandmother, so my great-grandma, who was Miriam Smith. She had been staying with the family

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.160
for a while but decided to move on because she felt it wasn't safe. How she managed that I don't

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:59.160
know. I did know Miriam, she was a very old lady when I knew her and she died when I was about six.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:11.000
My father also then later on, he was a messenger for the fire service, for the firefighters at night,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.480
so he rode his bike around Manchester delivering messages and things like that and he also worked

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:28.360
on the Lancaster bombers for Afros Hawker Sidley and he told us a story one day about

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:39.480
going up to Woodford aerodrome in Woodford, Cheshire and he was, they had to clean out the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.880
remains of whatever was in the aircraft that had been attacked and had been brought back,

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.280
which was a horrible job for somebody of his age. He must have had really quite a traumatic time

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.640
during the war. He did. With both his parents being killed, his aunt being injured, he being injured

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.200
and then the job of clearing the bombers after they came back. Did he, at the end of the war,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:14.360
did he talk about it to you? How do you know about it? No, he didn't. I then later on went to speak to

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:23.480
his uncle, who we called Uncle Fred because we lived with them for a while, and he said,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:31.480
don't mention this to your dad. So, and every time he watched the Royal Festival Halls of

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.960
Remembrance service, he would always get up and leave the room at some point. He was upset,

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:48.360
he was emotional about it. But this, when I said to my mum, I've been told not to talk to dad about

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:56.120
it, she said, oh, it's all right, you won't mind. So that was how we came to get these stories about

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.680
Avros. He was also very angry about the Avros because they kept on apprentices and then once

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.680
they'd finished their apprenticeship, they sacked them and took on new apprentices, money-wise,

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:16.280
financial scheme for them. So he wasn't very pleased with them at all. So you were brought

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.040
up in a household where he was trying very hard, wasn't he, too, perhaps? Oh, yes, he was. Yes.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:30.760
Yeah. And it only appeared after he died that he actually couldn't read properly. So all that stuff

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.720
affected him really badly. If he needed to write anything, my mum had

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.120
write it for him and then he copied it out. He had lovely handwriting,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.200
but he never read books. He was always... Such a complex life he must have led. Yes, very.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.840
Thank you so much for sharing that with me. It's a lovely, sad story.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.880
Thank you and I hope you enjoy the exhibition.
