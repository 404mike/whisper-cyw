00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
And what about the petrol pump? What's the history behind that?

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.160
Well the petrol pump, the tank of that's in the garden at Cross Cottage actually,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:16.000
with its outlet pipe. Because I think the garden, the yarded area, was enclosed by

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.400
gibbards. And so when I bought it there had to be a, you know, to sign a, there was a clause

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.160
that the land had been in possession for 20 years etc etc. But I think it was perhaps in dispute as

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.480
common land and John's father had built a petrol tank there before the hedging closed the ground.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.000
But the petrol tank was still operational when I moved in in the early 90s and I used to fill up my

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:53.680
car there. So people would come and go for a pint or two and have their, David would come out,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.880
that's John's father, would come out and manually pump because it's a hand pump,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.680
pump up the fuel. They put it on the tab and... Wow. So it was part of the pub really?

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.320
Oh part of the pub along with the, so John's got a number of businesses now of course, he's got the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.600
pub, Karen runs the post office, they've got holiday cottages, he's got the farm, he runs a bus

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:27.600
as well. But David's father of course when their family moved here they were tailors.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.600
So the little holiday cottage is called Taylor's Cottage. It was a tailor's, they were tailors

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.000
and the shop used to sell all sorts of things, sold everything. I wish it still did. From the shop and

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.120
I've still got some grandad shirts I bought there when John had the closing down sale

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.920
that were from the 1950s then, you know with the button down, the collars. So they sold everything

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.240
and David had a mobile van so he was ahead of his time because Tesco's van coming round now,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.520
he went up in all the hills and had his round with his vegetables, bread, gammon, he had a gammon

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.160
slice in there, milk, that's John's father David had that, and the shop and the post office and the

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:22.560
pub and the farm. They had so many businesses and that's what you have to do, you diversify

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.480
and they were very enterprising people and John continues that to today.
