My Life Story by Julia Gunn, Volume 3

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
My dearest Mam died on the 14th of June 2004.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It was a dreadful time and I stayed at the hospital with her until the end.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Anne and Jen were also there and Alison stayed one night too.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Mam had suffered terrible pain with her back, osteoporosis.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Auntie Yola and Auntie Ira, her sisters, were with us when she passed away.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I can't write everything down as it is so upsetting, but the memories, good and bad, will always be with me.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
She was cremated at Aberystwyth Crematorium and it was a large gathering with many standing.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Dad had bought a large white lily wreath and I shared the flowers on her family's graves after.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Dad and I chose a granite headstone. She was laid to rest at Machynllyd Cemetery.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I went up to see Dad the following day and he broke down, breaking his heart.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
In the end we were both crying as we missed her so much.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
On the day we said goodbye to Mam at the crematorium and after the lovely food we'd had at Lleti Gwynne Aberystwyth,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
my sisters and I went back to Dad's house.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
He shared some of Mam's jewellery as he wanted to do it while we were all together.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I was given Mam's wedding ring which was 22 carat gold and some of it being Welsh gold.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I had been promised it ever since I was a little girl because I was the eldest.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Mam had it made smaller for her finger when she became ill as she had lost so much weight.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
As it happened it fitted my finger perfectly.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I was also given Mam's peridot birth ring which Dad had bought for her from Clogau Gwld,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
as Welsh gold from Dog Allumaen because I was the only one born in August.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Mam was born on the 10th of August and I on the 13th.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I do actually prefer Celtic designed jewellery. I'm not one for diamonds etc.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I had been invited to go to a surprise party in the Midlands on the 9th of October 2004.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Mam's cousin Eilwen Rhys was 60 years old and her son Gavin was arranging this party for her.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I went with my two sisters Anne and Sian.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Anne was a very good driver but the navigator, Sian, was a little cocky.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I don't think I would have been able to drive around such a busy place.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
We were staying at a travel lodge in Oldbury and arrived at 20 past two on the day of the party.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
We met many of Mam's family there and had a great time.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Mam had one favoured cousin but sadly he had died. His name was Gwyn.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000
He'd been an opera singer, a tenor, also a very good chef and worked at some of the best hotels in London.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:09.000
His son Gareth was at the party and they showed him the little booklet of Mam's story that I had put together as Gwyn, his father, was mentioned in it.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
The taxi we booked to take us back to the travel lodge never turned up but we managed to find another one.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.000
We didn't like the look of the driver so Sian and I decided that Anne should sit in the front seat because she was an ex-policewoman.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
The driver was Indian and was having a conversation with another man on his radio.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Sian and I heard Anne say to him that he was going the wrong way but he insisted it was right.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Sian and I looked at each other. I thought that the three of us were going to be kidnapped.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Thank goodness we arrived back at the lodge safe and we laughed about it after.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
But you never know with three beautiful women do you?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Sharon, my daughter, was expecting her fourth baby.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.000
On the 8th of June 2005, Sharon's little girl was born and I stayed with Sharon during the birth.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000
I even cut the umbilical cord. Then the midwife handed the baby to me to hold. It was such a wonderful moment.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
The midwife also allowed me to film her examining the baby while Sharon had asleep.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Sharon called the baby Kelsey Jade. We were home the next day.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Ma came to fetch us and my dad and Patrick were waiting by Sharon's house to welcome them home.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.000
My dad was very protective towards her and as she grew older the bond between them was so strong.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Kelsey helped my dad to come to terms with my mam's death and it's strange that mam had told Sharon she was going to have a little girl one day.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Kelsey Jade was christened on the 9th of October 2005 at Holy Trinity Church, Corris by the Reverend Geraint Appiorweth.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Her godparents were Jane and Brian Vaughan. There was food afterwards prepared by her uncle Pat.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000
He was a chef at the Dwinan Pyrpyn Cainws. We had an enjoyable gathering of friends and family.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I recorded it all on film and Ray took plenty of photographs.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Ray and I had bought Kelsey's christening gown etc and she still dresses her doll in it now at my house.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Kelsey's name is at the beginning of the New Baptist Book at the church,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
whereas her brothers are on the last page of the Old One which is now at the archives in Dog Alley.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I've always had my grandchildren down almost every Saturday since they were born, also quite a few sleepovers.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I had so much fun with them even though it was very tiring.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000
The boys have now grown up and I don't see them very often but I have loads of films of all the good times we had.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I've made copies for each one which are saved in their special memory boxes with love from 9 Jew.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000
My favourite Saturday was when I took the boys down by the river in Kaikinos where my mam used to take us.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
It was a very hot day and we took a picnic, also ships etc to play with.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
The mud by the river was extremely wet as the cows had been walking in it

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
but they thought it was funny when their wellies were being sucked down and they couldn't move.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I think it was Ciaran who had to abandon his wellies and by now they were all filthy

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
so they washed their clothes in the river laughing so much before going home.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Kelsey also has lots of sleepovers too.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Once she had a bath with candles lit all around her, then went to watch Tide Ray printing photos in his dark room.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
We put her camp bed on the landing and left the whole light on all night for her.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Kelsey also has had many many sleepovers here throughout her childhood.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Remembrance Sunday this year coincides with the length of November our Mr's Day.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
It also happens to be 30 years since Ray served in Belize and Northern Ireland

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and 25 years since Ray narrowly missed service in the Falklands War.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:19.000
In addition to all that, this year marked the end of the military campaign to maintain peace in Northern Ireland.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.000
This 38 year campaign was I believe the longest continuous one in British military history.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Ray and I each decided individually that we would like to attend a Remembrance Day parade this year

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and we were delighted when we found out that not only did we both want to go

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
but we had even picked Corris as our preferred venue.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
The service is also one of the first to be held in the Institute since its major renovation

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and reopening to the people of Corris.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Connor and Kieran said they would like to come too so it was quite a family outing setting out from a revile.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000
The service was held inside the Institute and conducted by the Reverend Richard Staunton from Upper Corris.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
It was a relatively informal but moving service and not too long.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:17.000
The boys enjoyed it and behaved extremely well, raising many appreciative comments from other members of the congregation.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Many said how nice it was to see youngsters attending a memorial service of this kind and how smart and polite they were.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:34.000
After the service wreaths were laid in the front window and then turned to face outwards so that passers-by could see them properly.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000
I put a copy of a page from the Commonwealth War Graves Commission website with the wreaths.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:48.000
It's noted the death of my great uncle John Corriswin Thomas who was a member of the Royal Army Medical Corps.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:55.000
He was killed on Friday the 29th of May 1942, aged 26 in Libya.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:03.000
His name is inscribed on the 1939 to 1945 war memorial in the outer porch of the Institute.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Although Corriswin Thomas is buried in a war grave in Libya, his name is inscribed on his mother's gravestone in the Ryoboth Cemetery in Corris.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And this is what we had come to see.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And to the right of the grave is his sister Ellen Jones and her husband John Gomer Jones.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
These are the boys' great-great-grandparents on their mother's side.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Corriswin's mother was their great-great-great-grandmother.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
After inspecting the stones and having a brief lesson in their family history from me,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:44.000
they put their Remembrance Day poppies into a vase in front of the gravestone with Corriswin's name on it.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
We said our farewells to the family and walked back to the car.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:56.000
As we were not far from Abel-Leveni, we decided to carry on that direction and show the boys the quarry where their tied ken worked

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and lived for a while when I was a small baby.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
After that, it really was time to go home on this cold November day.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
We were all glad we went though.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.000
On the 23rd of March 2008, I decided to have an Easter egg hunt in my garden for the grandchildren.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:23.000
I'd already bought a bubble machine for them and there were small buckets containing Easter eggs at the co-op where I worked.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Also some cut-out arrows to place around the garden to add to the adventure.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
It was great fun to see little Kelsey's face when she found an egg.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:40.000
The boys were very good with Kelsey and I'm sure they let her find most of the eggs to fill her bucket.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.000
I can remember when Sharon was little insisting on having her Easter egg on the dressing table in the bedroom.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Patrick wanted his there too, so I gave in, but they had to promise not to eat it until Easter Sunday.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:03.000
It shows how naive I was because when Sunday arrived, there was only the front half of the egg still intact.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
They had eaten the back halves. I think they were hoping to eat them before I discovered it.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
I'm almost sure it was Sharon's plan.
