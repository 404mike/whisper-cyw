00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.320
What do we picture when we think about the Holocaust? Who do we think of? Where do we

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:19.920
think of them? Do we think of Nazi storm troopers barking orders at groups of defenceless Jews

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:28.000
in German streets? Of men, women and children wearing yellow stars being beaten? Of broken

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.040
glass of Hitler and rallies at Nuremberg? Do we think of trains transporting victims,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.240
families from their homes in central Europe to concentration camps and tree-lined thickets in

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:56.780
the East? Place names Bergen-Belsen, Treblinka, Dachau, Auschwitz-Birkenau. Barbed wire, wooden

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:05.540
huts and guard towers, places of death? Or do we think of heroic rescue? Of escape through enemy

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:15.660
lines? Of liberation, the resistance, the Warsaw uprising, the Kinder transport? Do we think of

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:22.180
Wales? Of Cardiff? Or Swansea? Or Abergella?

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.060
I knew where I was coming to in Wales because if you were under seven you had to have a home

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.860
to go to and I'd got pictures which I've still got of where I was going, the people, the husband

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:04.020
and wife and the grandfather and they had pictures of me. And then we got evacuated and we went to

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:13.780
Wales. While I was in Wales, in Cardiff, I went to the British Medical Association and said I was

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:23.340
here and I could do some work. So they sent me to Clwyn ap Ie hospital that was up in the Rhondda

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:34.020
Valley. We went to Llandudno, North Wales, a really good boarding house, but then we also had to

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.900
leave Llandudno, which became a protected area later on. Those three voices you just heard were

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.820
Renata Collins, Josephine Bruegel and Hans Albrecht. All of them fled their countries of birth,

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:55.820
Czechoslovakia and Austria, and became refugees in Wales. Each of them has a unique story,

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:06.460
sometimes uplifting, sometimes tragic, connecting the Holocaust to Wales. The Holocaust was one of

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.580
the defining moments of the 20th century and its effects were felt throughout the world,

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:18.380
including in Wales. Refugees from central Europe fled to Wales seeking sanctuary,

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:25.820
as did Holocaust survivors attempting to rebuild their lives in subsequent years. Welsh soldiers

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.500
and nurses were among the first to witness the horrors of the Nazi camps when they were liberated

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.900
at the end of the Second World War. In this podcast, we will explore how the Holocaust

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.940
impacted Wales. We will look at the stories of those who fled from Nazi tyranny to build

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.140
better lives for themselves and their families, and hear about the loved ones they had to leave

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:55.060
behind. We will learn how they have contributed to Welsh life, culturally, economically and

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.500
politically. The Holocaust did not just happen to other people in another place and time,

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:11.900
it is part of all of our history. This podcast has been created as part of Holocaust Resources

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.740
Wales, a project between the Centre for the Movement of People at Aberystwyth University

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:22.620
and the Jewish History Association of South Wales, and sponsored by the Association of Jewish

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.500
Refugees.
