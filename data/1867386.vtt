WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
My name is Jill Willie and it's the 20th of February 2019.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.240
And I'm here talking to Doreen Price

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.160
at her home in Bringuirada.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.500
And our aim is to seek out Doreen's memories

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.480
of the use of Riddikai Ross

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.080
and from there to learn something about the Ross management

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.640
and stories generally in the area.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.920
And it was in 1947, you said Doreen,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.540
that your husband's family bought Riddikai.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.180
So let's start now with the description

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.180
of the Ross pasture and particularly that of Riddikai.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.180
Yes.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.140
Whether it's wet, you know, whether it's been useful.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.180
Could you advise?

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.540
Well, yes, it's beyond improvement

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.740
because it was so flat there.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.220
You could never drain that, you see, it was too flat.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.820
But it was a useful as a run with the fields above,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.980
you see, it was especially for the sheep, mountain sheep,

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.420
they like to wander around,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.820
they don't like to be penned up anywhere.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.100
So it was a useful place and in the spring,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.700
they could have some water there, you see,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.980
in the puddles and things when they were producing milk

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.980
for their lambs.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.940
So it was a useful piece of ground that way, yes.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.980
And was it a useful resource

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.220
for a summer grazing cattle tour?

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.500
Yes, that's right, yes.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.620
We used to put the cattle out there beginning of May, say,

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.340
and we'd feed them for the time.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.220
But as the millennium grass started to grow,

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.420
it was sweet then, you see.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.900
And they grazed that, it was nice grazing,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.860
but once it gets stale, nothing wants to eat it, you see.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.780
So it was useful that way, yes.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.620
I see.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.620
And did you harvest any rushes for animal bedding?

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.900
Not off that, not off that, no.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.180
What about digging turf or peat for fuel?

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.980
No, no, no, we never did that, no.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.700
Gathering rushes for rush lights?

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.540
Oh, no.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.380
Nothing like that.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.220
No, that's right, no.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.380
What about ponies in summer?

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.100
Well, no, my husband had a riding pony,

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.940
but we never put him out on that, no.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.620
So, no.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.620
Now then, what about medicinal properties?

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.220
Was this pasture deemed to have medicinal properties,

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.260
and did you put sickly animals on it to graze?

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.780
Oh, no, definitely not.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.300
We'd want those near to where we lived, you see,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.820
to look after them, or in the building.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.780
Yes, we know we never put a sickly animal out there.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.620
I see.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.860
Now, regarding the activities on the Riddikarp Ross,

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.500
how exactly did you organize these activities?

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.580
For instance, were the farms cattle kept indoors

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.820
through the winter?

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.660
Yes.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.500
And then?

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.860
Yes, that's right, and then as the spring developed,

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.220
we'd have them outdoors for the summer.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.540
Yes, that's right, yes.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.180
And they stayed all summer, Doreen, did they?

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.260
Well, not necessarily.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.220
We'd move them to other pastures, you see.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.420
We wouldn't keep so many there all the time.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.940
You know, it would come and go,

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.220
according to how the grass was there, you see.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.140
So, no, we didn't keep them there all the time, no, too.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.980
I see.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.300
Now, was there any risk attached

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.740
to putting the stock on the Riddikai Ross, for instance?

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.660
Did they get stuck in the bogs?

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.660
Well, the last, well, I don't know,

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.300
was it three or four years that we had stock there?

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.380
For the first time ever, we had two cows stuck in the bog,

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.420
and never since 1947 until about 2002 or 2003.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.780
And we had two, one each year,

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.820
and we had to get the fire engine from Raider to get them out.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:02.660
Did you really?

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.420
I presume they did a wonderful job.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.220
Yes, yes, yes, they do, yes, that's right, yes.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.900
What about diseases, Doreen?

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.420
Did the cattle suffer from fluke, liver fluke, anything?

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.460
No, there was a disease called black water,

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.260
and on odd time, we'd have a cow with that.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.300
But it was very rare, but I can't really say

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.540
whether they were grazing there or on another pasture.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.740
I don't know where they were grazing, you see.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.740
So, but there was that, that's what they called it anyway,

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.740
I don't know, too.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.740
I see, now, regarding the drainage of the Riddikairoas,

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.180
did you drain at all?

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.860
No, no, no, you couldn't drain it,

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.340
it was too flat, you see, going to the stream at the bottom.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.340
It wasn't, and that's why it's a SSSI, you see,

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.460
it wasn't a piece of ground that you could drain.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.420
It was too flat.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.540
I see.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.020
And was the Riddikairoas a lot bigger

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.340
before the forestry came?

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.740
Was there generally more roast pasture

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.460
throughout the district in the past,

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.140
prior to forestry coming?

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.780
I wouldn't have thought so.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.940
We've got a little bit, you see, over on that goitre

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.980
where you'd cross when you were going with the,

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.500
walking up into the forestry, at the bottom of that neck,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.300
down next to the brook, there's a little bit there.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.300
But no, I can't say that that made any difference, really.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.340
I see, yes.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.540
And so why do you think the roast is still there then, Doreen?

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.860
What reason do you think it's still there for?

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.260
Is it too difficult to drain?

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.780
Oh yes, that's right, yes,

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.660
it's the natural state of the piece of ground.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.660
It's, you know, like where these boggy places are,

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.380
you know, yes, that's right.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.060
Do you feel that the soil is too poor to use there?

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.060
Well, and it's wet, you see, you wouldn't,

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.660
you couldn't improve it in any, you see,

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.100
it isn't a place you could plough or anything like that,

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.780
you see, to improve it.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.020
So really, it doesn't have an awful lot of use,

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.660
you know, is there?

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.660
Well, no, it's for these certain plants and that,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.260
they found there was 122 different species

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.500
of plant life on there.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.780
That's what it's famous for.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.500
So I would think so.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.980
And following on from that,

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.380
did you have personal memories of wildlife

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.060
such as lapwings, butterflies?

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.860
Well, lapwings and curlews used to be out there

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.140
and nested and we did see some wild geese

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.980
with their gullies out there.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.540
Well, they probably came from Lingwin,

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:14.340
but we never saw them, I think Mr. Raynard had them before,

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.180
they were able to fly from there.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.700
We never saw them bigger than good lumps like this,

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:25.060
you know, yes, but we've seen wild geese out there as well.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.180
But oh yes, and we'd hear the birds singing, you know,

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.060
cause there was quite a few trees there, you know,

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.260
if you walk about now in the spring and summertime,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.740
they'd be in full song out there, yes.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:43.340
And do you feel there was more wildlife,

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.820
more plentiful wildlife when you were younger?

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.740
Do you feel there was more wildlife, more flowers,

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:49.940
more everything?

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.940
Well, we didn't really study the flowers a lot, you know.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.460
There used to be those,

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.300
we used to call them golden globes next to that stream,

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.060
well, you'd never see those now,

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.260
I don't know how they've disappeared.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.980
You see, they were a nice little yellow,

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.980
almost like a big buttercup and it was like a global flower,

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.140
but and king cups and you know, different things like that.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.020
But I mean, though that sort, and we used to see,

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:26.020
well, we used to call them shivery shakes,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.620
they were like a grass with a circular,

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.540
silvery vertical on the top.

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:37.900
And you see in the wind, they'd fly like that

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.180
and they were shimmering.

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.140
Well, we never see those now,

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.420
I hadn't seen those for a long time.

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.700
So how, why they disappeared, I don't know.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.940
So.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.140
And as we were hearing last night at Raider by Nature,

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.900
hopefully the marsh artillery will make.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.420
Yes, that's right, yes, that's right, yes.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:00.100
Do you remember the marsh artillery in your younger days?

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:00.940
Do you remember those butterflies?

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.420
No, I don't, but do you see,

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.580
I wasn't so much into wildlife then, you see,

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.820
we were farming and looking at animals

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.820
and to see that their wellbeing was all right, you see.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:12.940
And if they were lambing,

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:16.180
we were looking for young lambs and something like that.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.740
You see, I can't say that I ever looked really

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.100
for things like that.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.460
Things like that, not a priority, I suppose,

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.100
when you're a busy farmer.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.380
No, that's right, no.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.300
So then.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.060
Yes, well, we have to ask this question now.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:33.220
Do you recall or have you heard stories of children

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.620
playing in the Riddikar-Ross?

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.780
What did they get up to?

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.740
No, well, I didn't, yeah, but you see,

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.500
like as I say, my husband was grown up before they had,

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.940
they bought that, so you see,

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:49.460
and I never ever heard him saying anything about that, no.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.180
So he used to collect birds' eggs, you know,

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.900
when he was young, he got quite a good selection

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.460
at Ashfield and he got them all labeled and everything.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.500
So, but I mean, you could do it in those days, you see, yeah.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.060
So.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.140
Very nice to have a sort of a hobby like that.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:09.980
Yes.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:10.820
To have that interest.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.660
Yes, that's right, yes, that's right, yes.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:14.500
So.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:19.420
Well, Doreen, thanks very much for sharing your experiences

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:23.700
and your knowledge and your interest in the Riddikar-Ross.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.740
I'm sure it's enlightened us quite a lot.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:26.580
Yes.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.620
Many, many thanks.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.020
Yes, yes, yes.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.180
If it's all right with you,

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.420
perhaps we could just speak generally

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:37.020
about your earlier life in Radnorshire,

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.180
because you're a Radnorshire lady through and through.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.820
Yes, I was born on a farm out in Bister area,

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:46.660
and I mean miles from everywhere.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:51.140
But in our young days, we had to make our own fun, you see.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.940
I mean, there was no television.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.140
Well, we had a radio,

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.740
but we didn't used to listen to that much.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.700
But I can remember my brother,

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.140
there wasn't a lot of difference

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.500
between my brother and myself.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:07.500
And we'd have an old bicycle, no, no, a rusty thing,

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.860
no tires or anything in it.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:13.860
And our yard was a bit of an incline at my home.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.980
Well, we'd push this,

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.420
push bike up to the top of this incline, get on that.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.940
There was no brakes or anything on it.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.260
We used to come down around the corner of the house

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.780
and to stop, we used to go into the manure heap.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.660
Well, there's one way of stopping, I'm sure.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.300
Yes, that's right, yes.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.780
And another thing, and my brother was very good,

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.140
what he'd call cobbling up things.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.620
We had a chassis of a pram,

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.740
and he put a piece of board on the chassis

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.900
and a piece of binder twine or something

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.580
to turn the wheels in the front.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.620
And we'd ride on this,

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.620
go up the top of the yard again

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.580
and go down as far as we could go.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.940
But I mean, we wouldn't go as far on that

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:00.620
as we would on the old bicycle.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.300
But you see, we had to make our own fun.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:07.540
And I can remember we'd make a playhouse,

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:11.980
we'd have little sticks like that and make little rooms.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.900
And then we'd go and make mud pies

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.020
for pretending to have tea.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.620
And we'd find some old little tins or something

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.580
and put this in and leave them, bake, turn them out.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.140
That was our way of tea.

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:29.100
Well, we got to make our own fun.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.340
And then as soon as we were able to do little jobs,

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:36.300
we were always given jobs to do on the farm, you see.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.380
I can remember my mother, she was very good that way.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:44.540
We used to have to carry our water about 100 yards,

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.860
I suppose it might've been 150.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.660
Well, as soon as we were able to,

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:54.180
we'd carry half a bucketful to start with from the well.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.700
And then as we'd get a bit stronger,

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:01.340
we'd have two half bucketfuls to balance either side.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:05.500
And then we'd progress to three quarters of a bucketful.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.220
And then we'd be able to carry two bucketfuls

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.660
down to the farmhouse.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:12.500
So...

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.980
Oh, for those days to return.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.460
Yes, that's right, yes.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:18.300
Wouldn't it be nice?

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.180
Oh, yes, we had such a carefree year.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.420
And then we were, my mother especially,

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.540
she'd learn me to teach me how to iron,

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.100
start off with handkerchiefs.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:32.660
And you see, we used to heat the flat iron

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.620
on an open fire, you see.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.540
And then we'd have a shield to put the iron in.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.300
Well, she put it all ready for me,

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.660
but she'd encouraged me to iron little things

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:44.940
on the table, you see.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:49.020
And then for rabbits, to get me to skin a rabbit,

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.860
well, a little, like a young one,

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.980
about something three quarters grown.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.100
Well, it was easy to skin then.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.820
And if I did something, well, she praised me so much,

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.540
I'd achieve something if I could do that.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.900
She was very good at encouraging us

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.660
to do little jobs like that,

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:08.780
because we were helping them,

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:13.180
and it was teaching us how to do something

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.740
in the future, you see.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:15.780
So...

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.420
Making you very resourceful, I'm sure.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.500
Yes, that's right, yes.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.060
And then in the harvesting time,

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.100
but I was never very good with the harvest.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.340
I was a bit of a weekly one,

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:31.060
and I was a duffer with a pike or a rake, really,

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:34.580
for raking up, because I wasn't doing it right,

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.460
and then I'd have a pain up the side of my head.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.380
But we used to be able to take out,

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.780
when the men were out on fields,

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.860
we take their tea or their food out for them.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.100
Well, no flasks in those days.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.020
We used to make it in bottles.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.220
Well, the tea would only be lukewarm,

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.020
because otherwise it would be,

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.300
but with milk in it.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.060
But I mean, that was acceptable,

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.260
and they had that, and we'd take that out for them

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.420
to wherever the hay field was,

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.580
and they'd eat that,

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:07.100
and then we'd bring the empties back home with us.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.660
So...

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.220
Yes, as you say, a more carefree existence,

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.900
and that's the way things were then, I suppose.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.340
Yes, that's right, yes, that's right.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.020
Special days in the year,

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.860
I mean, you've mentioned Mayfair.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:20.700
Yes.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.340
Were there any particular occasions

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.420
that really stick out in your memory?

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.660
Well, that was, we used to go to Knighton,

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:32.660
was our market town,

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.460
and Mayfair, there was the 17th of May,

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.140
where we always went there,

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.300
but I never liked Mayfair myself.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.980
I don't know why, it didn't appeal to me.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.420
I liked the journey there,

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:45.820
because we used to go by car,

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.020
and we thought it was such a long way.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.180
But I never enjoyed Mayfair myself,

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.580
but we'd go on the rides and things, you know,

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.100
but I was always glad to get back home.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.980
So, that's right, yes.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.980
I remember the Red Mayfair,

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.580
that was May the 12th, of course.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.020
Yes, that's right, yes, that's right, yes.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.980
And we used to, I used to go to Sunday school.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.820
We used to walk to a Baptist Sunday school then,

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.780
because my mother was Stonch Baptist,

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.940
well, and it was the nearest to walk to.

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.460
And we'd always have a children's anniversary in the autumn,

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.700
you see, where we'd practice singing,

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.340
or recitations or something.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:30.300
We'd get up on the platform and do our duties there.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.060
But that was a special occasion.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.500
Which Baptist chapel was that then?

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.340
That's the Pound Baptist Chapel.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:39.180
The Pound?

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.340
Pound, yes.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.740
You go up to Lombister,

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.060
and over the top and down the other side.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.380
Right.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.820
Is it still a working chapel?

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.980
Oh yes, yes, yes, it's still, yes.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.940
And they still have an anniversary,

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.380
but I mean, they have about three children

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.340
on the platform now.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.540
Things have certainly changed.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:58.380
Yes, that's right, yes.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.620
As far as churches have changed.

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.460
The chapels have concerned, yes, that's right, yes.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:07.220
And we used to, well, you see, my primary school,

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.020
we could go home for our lunch from where I lived,

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.700
go up to school, it was only about half a mile,

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.020
to walk to the primary school.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:19.060
Well then, of course, we never had lunch break.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.740
You see, by the time we'd walk home and have our dinner,

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.300
and walk back up, it was time to go back into school.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:28.540
So we never had any playtime to play with the other children.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:32.620
And one bone of contention for me was that mother

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:38.500
always supplied the school teacher's wife with milk.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:44.820
So much skim milk and so much full fat.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.820
Well, I got to carry those tins up in the morning.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.020
Well, I didn't mind doing it in the morning,

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.780
but coming home at night,

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.780
we could have played with some of the other children,

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.060
but the one was enamel.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.740
Well, you see, I got to be very careful with that

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:02.180
because otherwise I would have chipped it.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:07.020
So that, I always hated having to carry those home with me.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:07.860
So, yes.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.020
Oh, we could talk for so long, couldn't we,

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.340
about days gone by. Yes, that's right, yes.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.580
Bye, yes, that's right, yes.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.740
Thank you, thank you very, very much indeed, Doreen,

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.220
for your time, for your knowledge,

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.900
and for sharing your memories with us,

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.900
which allowed us to record.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.540
Yes, that's right, yes.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.860
So I'll say thank you very, very much indeed.
