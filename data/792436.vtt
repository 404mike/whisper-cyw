00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.580
Okay, I'm Rob from the Llanberis Community Orchard Group. We're at the YHA in Llanberis,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:22.120
which has an old orchard that we are bringing back to life. And this is what I've come up

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:29.700
with in my story this morning. So why wander? I like wandering. So I like to wander because

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.780
I meet new people. I listen to new voices. I revisit old friends and places. I enjoy

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:44.060
new colours, landscapes, wildlife, food and drink. I forget my worries. I get healthy.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:51.020
I refresh my outlook on life, past and future. I can change my destiny. I can embrace my

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.260
future and I don't regret my past. I live more in the present. Wandering is good for

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.780
my physical, mental, emotional, cultural and social wellbeing. But wandering doesn't have

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.280
to mean physically travelling places, although that can sometimes help. You can go to and

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.740
experience new things in your imagination or by challenging yourself culturally, mentally

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.540
or creatively. Thank you.
