00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So one of the things that I struggle with the most actually is language.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So one of the sort of clearest connections to a nationality is language.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But English is the only language I really speak fluidly.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And my parents spoke German at home and German was very much the lingua franca of all art.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So our kind of milieu in Cardiff all spoke, well, they were from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Vienna, Germany, Hungary.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
All over the place. And many of them were multilingual, but they all spoke German together.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So I've been brought up in a German speaking environment, but I don't really speak German like a native.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And I don't speak Welsh. I don't speak any Hungarian.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And so you feel as though you belong to those identities, but it's very tenuous somehow.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:08.000
There's something a bit, if you don't actually speak the language, your relationship with the identity is much more tenuous, I think.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And so you feel I feel a bit of a fraud because if I'm in a lift with people who speak Hungarian to each other, I know they're speaking Hungarian.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I can recognize Hungarian, but I can't say anything to them.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'm Hungarian, mate. But, you know, so you feel as though you're a little bit.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
It's all a bit intangible.
