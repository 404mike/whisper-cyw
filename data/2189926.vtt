00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
I'm Vicki MacDonald and I'm at Holy Trinity Church in Sandinow as part of the Longest Yarn

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:13.200
and I have with me Peter and Jackie Smith and they're going to talk about their parents'

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.080
time during the war. I'll start with you Peter if I may please. Can I ask you a little bit about

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.000
you what you remember about your father and what he did during the war? My dad was a coal

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.000
William Smith and he served in the Second World War between 1939 and 1941. As far as I know he

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.960
told me stories of him serving in Iceland primarily to keep the the Germans from occupying Iceland

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.840
and having some sort of influence in the North Atlantic. He was there like I said well about

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:58.160
1941 and he served with the Sixth Battalion York's and Length Regiment

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:11.040
known as the Polar Bears from Sheffield that's their nickname and he didn't tell me a lot but

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.280
I think people at that time kept a lot to themselves. I've got photographs of him

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:29.360
actually traveling to Iceland on a troop ship of a sort and one thing I do remember is that

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:37.600
his best man at his wedding was his best mate in the army and he has got photographs of them both

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.320
stood together with their obviously with their battle dress and steel helmets on. So he survived

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.040
the war and did he meet up with his Sheffield Polar Bears? Polar Bears from Sheffield.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.680
I think that's the most amazing name isn't it? So did he meet up with them? Did they feel them?

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:04.240
I do not recall him meeting up with a sort of reunion or anything like that but he

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.000
obviously kept in touch with his best man because he married my mum in 1952.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.960
That's a really lovely story I think you know something wonderful for you to remember

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:26.480
especially today thank you. I'm going to now speak to Jackie and ask her about her father's stories

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:36.800
during the war. Well actually it was my grandfather. My own parents they were too young to serve

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:46.640
in the war but my grandfather he was around when it was the Sheffield Blitz and I can recall him

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:56.720
telling me about the horrific scenes that he did. Go and see and help retrieve the bodies from the

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.000
blitz and and all the devastation that was around there and as he was a coffin maker

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.520
he made lots of coffins and helped with all the funerals and things for all the people that

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.080
you know that died at that point. So he must have had quite a traumatic war really I mean

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.880
yeah it must have been really difficult and he probably didn't get any medals for it.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.400
I think he's got a lot of two medals various medals. My husband's got those he collects all

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.960
the things from us. I'm sure he's got a little tin with all his machine books in and all his

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:42.400
little things he's got. So did he stay as a he was you said he was a joiner? He was a joiner and he

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:50.320
remained a joiner for most of his life. From that he went into construction building and stuff

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.760
like that with his contracting. More fun and less devastating. Thank you very much.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.120
So back to Peter because he's now going to talk about his mother who worked in an

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:09.280
ordnance factory during the war. Peter? Yeah I mean during the outbreak of war 1939 1940

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.960
my mum would have been 20 years old and she she worked in the royal

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:22.560
well. The ordnance factory which was about six miles away from where where she lived

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:35.120
and it was set up as a sort of ghost factory. It took all sort of out of the bombed areas and

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:43.680
moved it up to Yorkshire out of the way of the bombs and yeah she she manufactured bullets and

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:50.240
shells for use in this for use by the army. Did she do that right the way through though?

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.720
I think she did yes I think she did I mean the the factory was still there

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.480
after the war. I mean I can remember it as a bit it had been converted into something for

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:12.640
peacetime production but it was always there and I don't believe that she did serve

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.240
to the end. Did she suffer afterwards? Did she have long problems? Really? I mean she

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.960
totally protected were they? No I mean there wasn't protected but the area that she was in

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:31.680
wasn't it wasn't a heavily bombed area during the war and it was like I said at a time where

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:39.520
they were sort of moving the sort of critical manufacture of certain things that you know

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.120
into sort of ghost factories and that. Did she speak about it after the war?

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:56.720
Not a lot I mean she obviously told me where she was during the war and she always sort of

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:03.440
the one particular story that I get is that she was walking home one night

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:14.240
and there was a bombing raid on Sheffield and the village that we lived in on the top of the hill

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:21.120
with two anti-aircraft guns and these anti-aircraft guns opened fire and she said she just never

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:27.840
stopped running until she got home and that's just one snippet that I do remember her telling me.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:34.240
Can't imagine being fired on on your way back from work. Thank you Peter very much. Thank you.
