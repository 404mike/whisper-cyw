00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So what happened then?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Six months of rap and Rabbi Graf said, right, you can start coming to lessons.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So every Wednesday evening I drove down from Tonopandy, went to his home,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and he just started going to the scriptures and the festivals, set his homework every week.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We had to practice our Hebrew. We never learned to translate it, we just learned to read it.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I found it relatively easy because it's quite akin to Welsh.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And I did shorthand as well, and that was handy, you know, because with shorthand you leave vowels out and whatever.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So that came in handy really. So I took to it quite well.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Because you've been to college over here.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Yes.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So what did you do at college?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I did a secretarial course. So I studied law, English, shorthand, typing, and that was it.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Were you a Welsh speaker when you were younger?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
No.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So was college the first time you did Welsh?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
No, Welsh was in grammar school. I took Welsh for GCSEs.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Or O-Levels they were called, weren't they?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I mean, I had a smattering of Welsh, I had a background, I could read it.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I opened it up here, I could read it. I probably wouldn't be able to understand it, but I could read it.
