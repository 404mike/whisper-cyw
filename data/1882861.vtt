Newport Rock Collecting is a social history and archiving project by Winding Snake Productions,

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.120
funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, and in partnership with Newport Museum.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.980
Since 2019 the project has been gathering memories and artifacts from people who attended

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.540
gigs in Newport between 1970 and 2010 for a new audio archive and exhibition celebrating

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.180
Newport's commitment to bands, gigs and music.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.500
