00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Colour is my main inspiration and I'm surrounded by it.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.000
And because where we live,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.440
we get a lot of walkers come past our house as well,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.720
because like literally the end of our garden,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.780
our garden goes right round the house.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.560
And to this side of me,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.680
there's like a little lane that goes down

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.880
to the connects to the coastal path.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.940
So we get a lot of people around all the time,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.040
but our garden is a mature garden.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.200
It's got loads of shrubs and trees and stuff in it,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.000
as do the surrounding gardens.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.880
But we can also see the sea, which is amazing.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.600
Although I can't actually see it from here.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.680
This is my workspace.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.640
I'm actually sat at my work desk.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.760
I can't actually see the sea.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.280
But the weird thing is, because you know it's there,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.440
it's like just around that bit of brick and the window.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.120
I know it's there, so it's still kind of, you know,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.920
like my work room is kind of like a stuck on the front

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.200
of the house type of conservatory building.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.480
So it's freezing in the winter and boiling in the summer,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.020
but it's all glass.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.540
So wherever I sit in my work room,

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.720
and unless I'm facing that wall,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.880
I just have trees and shrubs and the sky.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.560
And you know, if I'm outside,

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.520
if I just go for a walk,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.320
and literally two minutes and I'm looking at the sea.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.160
So it's very motivational.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.160
I'm watching people.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.960
You can see life walking past,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.120
which is another thing for me.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.400
People are important to me as well in all aspects.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.400
So that's where I get a lot of my burning has quotes on it,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.280
motivational quotes or supportive quotes.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.280
And I think that's because I feel motivated and supported

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.920
in my home and in the town and in the community.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.160
So therefore that comes out in my work.
