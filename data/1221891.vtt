A few days later the Germans actually marched in and I could see the columns of the Germans

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.000
marching into Prague.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:22.160
There was, where we are living, a boarding on a wall and there were various posters placed

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.440
there.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:36.520
The Germans used to use it to write posters and I remember that they used the Czech language

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.840
but it was particularly badly written.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:49.560
So I think they went out of the way to humiliate the Czech people by writing Czech notices

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:56.920
in a bad language because there was no shortage of people who could have written it in a perfect Czech.
