00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
So far we've talked only about the past and the present and nothing at all about

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.520
the future and yet the future of Connors Quay lies more in the youngsters hands

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.480
than in many other places because here with expanding industry families are

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.940
moving in and the two or three children in each house on the New Estate will be

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.720
starting their lives here. Work there is so far as one can see and plenty. What

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.360
about leisure? Well we've tracked down George Curran the entertainment manager

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.320
we've come to the Civic Centre which is really a rather pleasant place and he's

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.800
let us come onto the stage here alongside the swimming bath. Mr. Kerr what

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.360
is there for the youngsters? I suppose there are youth clubs. Oh yes yes we have

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.880
youth clubs in the area and on the whole they're fairly well supported. They're

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.360
mostly run by the churches. Mostly yes by the churches and of course the Civic

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.960
Centre itself we run two to three dances a week for the youngsters which

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.920
again are well supported but I feel that we could do more in this respect. For

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.640
instance? Well what I would like to see is a large room that could be used as a

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.160
sort of social centre for the youth of the area with something like a bar in

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.760
one corner serving soft drinks, a jukebox or a resident disc jockey. A real

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.760
discotheque in other words as a kid understands it rather than a social

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.160
centre which puts the establishment stamp on it. Yes but still we you know it

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.160
would be a place where everybody could meet their friends they could come in

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.680
and sit as long as they wanted to and we also provide games in there such

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.000
as darts dominoes other things like that. I suppose there'd be sort of

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.080
spin-off activities which you'd gently introduce without making the youngsters

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.680
feel that it was being pushed on to them. Oh yes and I'm sure this could be

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:01.240
done you know me myself I'm a very keen motorcyclist and I know a lot of

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.320
the younger people have got scooters and motorbikes and I'm quite sure a

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.440
club you know for catering specifically for them could be put into operation. Now

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.380
there must be other types of clubs that we could cater for as well. Do the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.840
youngsters round about tend to help themselves in this way? Have they come

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.680
forward with any ideas I mean in connection with swimming or anything

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.320
else? Oh yes I think they do but there's one or two in the area that are sort of

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.440
outstanding at this and they can sort of round everybody else up. In what respect?

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.560
Who are they? Well one in particular is a Miss Sheaby

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.080
Hannaby who's the secretary of the swimming club and this girl has done

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.600
wonderful work in connection with the club. I'm sure that the Connorsky

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.800
women's club must be one of the best-run clubs in the country. This was quite

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.760
spontaneous on her part. Yes oh yes. And another one? Well Mr. Victor

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.560
Richard is another example. If you want to raise money for charity or something

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.120
like this you contact Victor and he gets the kids cracking together you know and

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.200
they go out in a march raise funds this way something like that. Right Mr. Kerr now

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.160
what about music? Well I'd like something by Woody Herman and his orchestra.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.560
Particularly Apple Honey if that is available.
