Heinz was always far more interested than I in analyzing work and his always had a psychological slant,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that is it had to reflect some very consciously inner states of mind. It sounds ghastly if I say it like that,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but he was very introspective and very analytical about everything, not just his work.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:56.000
He had very delicate hands and delicate fingers and his work had the same delicacy and I thought it was quite unique.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We both felt that because of our background and everything that had happened that we were outsiders

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and that we couldn't somehow be accepted by the art establishment.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Then he bought an old farm in Wales and finally he left teaching and settled in Wales on that farm

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and turned it into his own little empire where he produced very interesting and intricate paintings that I liked very much.
