The oil didn't arrive in 10B straight away. Maybe it took a couple of days or something.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And the morning it arrived in 10B, we walked down to the seafront and just looked at these crowds of people

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:40.000
all ages, everybody was there. And people were crying, that was the main thing.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You could see people had tears rolling down their faces, old men, teenagers, children.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Everyone was just so horrified and grieving. They were shocked and it was horrible.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I've never experienced grief at that scale. Just feeling that grief and feeling the natural response to grief

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:32.000
which is to gather up and talk with people and comfort each other.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So in the same way as if somebody had died, it felt like a natural thing to want to be together.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And not just together in our houses, but together by the sea because it felt that there were all these animals

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:13.000
that had died, millions of things, big and small, and birds and shells.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:31.000
It was very strong, that feeling that there had been a massive death of creatures.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And obviously for us humans, the consequences of that, that we understood or didn't understand or knew about or didn't know about,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
but we could feel the impact.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And so I went home and took my... it was before computers, before we had computers in our own homes,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:16.000
before we had mobile phones. So I just took my diary and my phone book and just ran every single number that was on there

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and told people if they wanted to meet up on Castle Hill. Maybe a couple of nights from then.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I was in the fun all day. And then people saying, I can come but I'll light a candle or I'll light a fire in the garden.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And so it happened here. And we're just looking at the sea. Yeah, it was quiet and it was quite sombre.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And it's like you could feel something quite powerful really.
