WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.240
In a second, should say, there we go, we're recording now. Where are you at the moment?

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.720
I'm at home.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.600
Okay, so I'm going to ask you to introduce yourself. I'll introduce myself and say today's

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.360
date and then we'll just get going. Is that okay?

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.360
That's fine.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.120
Bear with me one second. I realize I've lost something that's got some of the things that

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:37.640
we're going to talk about. I've got so many screens open, I can't find anything.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.640
Lovely.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:49.400
There we go. So today is Monday the 26th of October 2020 and my name is Paul Hunt. Could

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.200
you introduce yourself please?

00:00:51.520 --> 00:01:02.920
Hi, I'm Rhiannon. That's it, my name is Rhiannon. Hello.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.680
So Rhiannon, you spoke to Anna before, didn't you, about just friendships and relationships

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.680
in general?

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.080
Yes, I did.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.920
And how have things been on that front, ignoring, I suppose, Covid and lockdown for now, but

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.200
how did you find it up to March? Any developments?

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:37.640
Yes, there have been quite a lot of developments, although I was doing online dating, which

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:52.960
At first I didn't think it was very successful, but now I've met someone and we've been together

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.760
for 11 months, so it's been really good.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.760
Wow.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:06.200
It's been the first time for a long time that I've actually been in a good place.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.520
Oh, that's nice to hear. So are you comfortable talking about them?

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.000
Yes, I am.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So what's their name?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:27.880
Well, his name is Andy. Obviously, as I said before, we've been talking online and we got

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:39.160
together at the end of last year, which has been great because the company's been great,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:50.440
the conversation's been flowing very well and it's a good place that I'm in right now.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.480
And where does Andy live?

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.080
He lives up in the valleys.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.080
Do you know which valley?

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.080
Marseille-Cama.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.040
Oh, OK. We know, yeah, I know.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:17.720
So it's up there somewhere. But we keep in touch every day. We message each other every day and we

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.080
video call sometimes, which is good.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.880
And so were you able to meet him before everything kicked off in person?

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:38.920
Yes, definitely. We met each other twice before the whole lockdown started happening.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:51.800
So it's been really good. I didn't think I'd find that person because I didn't think

00:03:51.800 --> 00:04:01.160
relationships would happen in my life. But now that I've found love, it's the best thing

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.000
that's ever happened. I've never been so happy.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.680
So who made the first contact?

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:25.960
I made the first contact and then I didn't hear from him for a while. And then I messaged him again

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:38.040
and it went on from then. So, yeah, it took a bit of persuading because I don't give up a fight.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.000
What attracted you to Andy?

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:50.360
Personality, humour, which also is very important.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:02.360
And he's always up for doing new things, like going out, going places.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.800
He's actually made me push the boat out and made me do a lot more.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.280
And I feel a lot more confident in myself.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.720
What kind of things has he pushed you to do?

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:30.760
Going to Cardiff. He's actually, I wouldn't say made me, but he's given me the opportunity to

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:42.280
have the confidence to go out more, to go to new places.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.840
And he's made me feel very relaxed as well.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.000
Do you remember the first time that you met him in person?

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:04.840
Yes, we went to a pub when the Six Nations was on last year.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:16.440
And we ended up going to a pub watching the game in a pub and then having a few drinks and then

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:29.560
going somewhere else for food and watching the rest of the game. So that was the first of many,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.120
which was really good.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.480
How did you feel on the day before you met him?

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.840
I felt very nervous because I didn't know what to expect. I didn't know what to do.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:53.000
I'd never been on a real date, if you could say that, because I've never had

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:06.360
proper relationships or I would say friendships, but that's a different story. But

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:17.560
having a relationship is the best thing that can happen to me right now. And what's the best part

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:24.120
is that my whole family like him as well. So at least I've done something good.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.400
I was going to ask what do your family make of him?

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:39.080
They like him a lot. I think they feel comfortable around him and he's a good love as well.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:51.240
He is sometimes very quiet, but once you get to know him, he does start to

00:07:52.040 --> 00:08:02.360
talk a lot, which I'm liking a lot. I'm happy to introduce him to all my friends and family

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:07.640
so they know that I'm at last as happy as Larry.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:19.960
We've talked before, obviously, you've mentioned before some mental health issues and

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:25.640
the fact that you have a learning disability. Does he have a learning disability?

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:38.920
Not that I can see or I'm aware of. He does look after me really well,

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:50.280
which is good. We look after each other. It's actually good to have, if I can say it,

00:08:50.840 --> 00:09:05.800
an ordinary normal relationship and not having to be watched by someone else just to check that

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.880
we're doing okay and we're keeping safe and stuff.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.600
Has that happened to you before? Are you thinking of instances that happened before

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.240
or do you think that would happen if he had a learning disability?

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:27.320
I think it would happen if I did go out with someone who did have a learning disability,

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:39.080
that it would be monitored on a regular basis because I don't class myself as having a learning

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:50.520
disability. As I said before, in a lot of my things that I've done, I sit on the fence with

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:59.720
with disability because I can do what everyone else does. I can go out on my own. I can

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:09.800
live independently and I don't have to have someone watch me 24-7.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.040
Can you talk about what you have in common?

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:32.360
We like sports. He likes rugby and he's very into his cars, which is great.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:40.680
We like going to the cinema together. We've been going a lot

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:52.520
a lot lately to the cinema to watch a film, which is great. We like going out for food

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.200
and I think that's about it.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.840
Next thing I'm going to talk about is whether you're comfortable talking about it or not.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.040
Completely up to you. If you think I don't want to talk about that, that's fine.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.320
Is there a physical aspect to your relationship with Andy?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.320
Sometimes there is, but not always.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.480
Did you ask anyone for advice or support around that?

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:42.040
I didn't know how to approach the subject, but I speak to my best friend back home.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:54.200
I try and catch up with her when I can about how things are going and

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:06.840
what stuff that she can recommend to do or not to do. At least she's on hand at that.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:18.040
I don't think I would be very comfortable approaching my mum and dad about this.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:29.800
They probably think that I'm not being careful, if that makes sense.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:40.600
My dad beforehand, before I got into a relationship, was saying to me,

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:50.120
when are you going to settle down, find a boyfriend and settle down and start a family?

00:12:50.440 --> 00:13:02.200
I hope you're being really careful. It's a different side now that I'm in a relationship.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.320
I suppose we'll only have to cross that bridge when we come to it.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.360
Is it something you've talked to Andy about?

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:25.720
Yes, we have. Not too much, but it has been on the cards sometimes when it comes up into conversation.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.440
You say you spoke to your friend about things and obviously you didn't feel comfortable

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:40.360
talking to your parents. Do you think your parents see you differently now?

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:49.640
Yes, they can see how happy I am and how confident I am in myself as well.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:14:01.640
I'm finding that as well. I'm finding it more pleasurable going out to places that I wouldn't

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:11.400
dream of going. That's given me a big boost, if that makes sense.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:20.760
Yes, it does. Thinking then of the last seven and a half months,

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.400
how have you found this period in time?

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:35.640
It's very difficult. Not seeing friends or family or all going out.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:46.120
Being stuck home all day every day is giving me cabin fever.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:53.160
Could you just say if you live on your own or with other people?

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:58.680
I do live with my boyfriend at the moment.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.280
I was going to ask.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:06.680
He does go home sometimes, but we do live together now.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:11.480
At the start back in March, were you living together then or were you apart?

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.000
We were together, thankfully.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:27.800
I knew that if Andy wasn't around that it would be very lonely.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:35.080
I wouldn't be as happy as I am now because I wouldn't be able to see anyone.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:44.120
I'm only maybe FaceTime or Teams or on Zoom.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:54.760
But I am also at the moment, I have been doing a little bit of work here and there, but only at home.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.160
I see. Sorry, go on.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.000
Which has been keeping my brain occupied.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.600
It's given me something to do.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.560
Who do you work for again?

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.120
I work for, well, I've got two jobs now.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:22.760
I'm still with Newport People First, but I haven't been able to

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:32.120
really start with work with them for a while because my job has changed in that respect.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:40.920
But I am working for Growing Spaces.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.160
They do all sorts of stuff.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.640
Like they've got a gardening group.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:55.480
They've got a travel buddy group, which I'm involved in.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:03.160
They've got quite a few shops happening as well.

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:10.520
I'm hopefully going to get more involved with that if and when everything goes back to

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.200
the way it was before lockdown.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.000
Were you furloughed at all or not?

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:25.800
No, my job finished with Newport People First at the end of February this year.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:31.960
I was going to have a month off and then start back in April.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:37.160
But because of the lockdown, I haven't been back since.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.760
But there's plans for you to go back at some point, is there?

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:48.600
Because I've got a new job happening if and when I go back.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:55.400
Because my project, as I said before, it's finished now.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.280
So I'll be going on to something different.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:08.360
There was no question at the start of lockdown that you would stay with Andy rather than

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.800
maybe going back on your own, is it?

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:18.200
No, I'm quite happy with Andy being here.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.320
It's also a company for me.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.960
I'm glad it's happened when it has happened, if that makes sense.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.360
How do you think you would be coping if you were still single?

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.880
I think I'd be tearing my hair out and thinking, what have I done wrong?

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.560
What am I doing wrong?

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:59.480
It's just one of those things that I think, why haven't I managed to find the right person?

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:04.520
I mean, I know it's taken me 16 years to get to where I am.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:11.960
But I'm in a good place now and hopefully it'll be forever.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:21.320
And thinking outside of your relationship with Andy, how has it affected the way that

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:26.120
you access the groups or social activities that you attend?

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.720
Are you still able to do them online?

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.280
Have you been to any before we got lockdown?

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:45.320
I have been to Zoom calls first, having meetings once a week just to see how everyone's coping,

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.960
what they've been up to, that sort of thing.

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:55.160
And again, I've been doing that with Growing Space.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:01.800
They have been keeping in touch with them once a week, once maybe twice a week.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:10.760
But I know Newport People First haven't been having Zoom calls for a while.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.600
But I think this week they're starting up again.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:30.520
And that's the only group that I've been involved in.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.160
I haven't been involved in any other groups.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:42.760
How did you find socializing and talking to people through Zoom rather than face to face?

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:49.240
I found it really hard because I'm so used to seeing people in the flesh,

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:55.400
not over a computer screen.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.440
But I suppose you can't really help that.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:11.240
But at the moment you can't see people in the flesh or have meetings outdoors or indoors

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:16.120
because it's just not happening.

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:22.520
But I'm looking forward to the time where things do go back to normal.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:35.720
And we can see people in person and to have meetings and to meet up for coffee like we've

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.160
done before, go out as a group.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.640
That's what I'm missing right now is literally going out.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:53.080
So how has it affected your well-being being locked down and not being able to do those things?

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:59.800
Yes, it has because I'm in hibernation mode

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:05.880
because I haven't been able to see anyone.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.240
I am finding it hard.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.920
I mean, I'm not coping right now.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.880
I just want to go outside and scream.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:22.200
But I mean, it's not only happening here, it's happening all over the world.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:33.640
I could imagine what other people are feeling, not having to go out to go to work or go shopping

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.120
and just having a good time.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:44.440
And obviously we're back into day three of the second lockdown now.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.040
How did you feel when that was announced?

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:53.960
It's deflating because I thought in some ways that we were slowly going to go back to work

00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:01.960
and to do what we can do like go out.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:09.800
I'm hoping that if we do this now, we can still see friends and family over Christmas

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.800
because that's what's warning us.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:18.920
I'm hoping that we can still see friends and family over Christmas.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:25.800
I'm hoping that we can still see friends and family over Christmas.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:31.560
Because that's what's worrying me a lot now is that because of lockdown,

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.840
that we won't be able to have a Christmas.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.640
What would be your plans if there wasn't a lockdown?

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.640
Now I'd be working for Deafinite.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.640
I'd be carrying out my work.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:24:00.760
I'd be carrying out my meetings like I have done over the few years that I've been with

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:11.640
Newport People First and hopefully I'd be making a difference to people's lives with

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.320
taking them places they've never been to before.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:21.560
Thinking Christmas Day, would you normally go to see your parents or go somewhere else?

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:35.560
Yes, I'd be going to my parents over Christmas because we usually have Christmas together anyway

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:41.720
with my sister and her husband coming down from London.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:49.320
If we have a lockdown like this over Christmas,

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.480
Christmas isn't going to be the same this year.

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.560
I don't think.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.400
Were you with Andy last Christmas?

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.760
No, I was with Andy last Christmas.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:09.560
No, this will be our first proper Christmas together.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:14.760
So if you're still locked down at Christmas, will you be spending it with Andy then?

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:15.960
Yes, definitely.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:24.760
If you've had ups and downs in the last few months, who do you speak to about those things?

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:30.520
I've been talking to, because I also get support as well.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:37.000
So I've been having support about it.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:48.520
But now because of the new lockdown, I've cancelled my support for these two weeks.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.720
What kind of support do they give you?

00:25:51.880 --> 00:26:04.920
I have support with going shopping or sometimes they'll help with housework,

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.480
things like that.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.960
If I need to go to a doctor's appointment, they'll come with me.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.560
That sort of thing.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.400
How did they react to your new relationship?

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.120
They were very happy.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:36.840
Although with the support workers that I've been having, I haven't had a constant one coming every week.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:42.920
I've been having different people come every week, so it's really difficult.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.960
Not having the same people every time?

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:46.520
Yes.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:51.560
Do you feel that they know you well or is it not enough time to get to know someone?

00:26:52.520 --> 00:27:00.360
It's not enough time to get to know them because you have one person and then you don't see them

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.200
for a month or two and then they just rock up out of the blue.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:08.600
The thing is I get so many new people come see me that I don't even know.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:19.640
I haven't met before and with that I always like to get to know them first before I chuck them in the deep end.

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:26.600
I don't know which is better, throwing them in the deep end first and then getting to know them

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:32.680
or getting to know them first and then chucking them in the deep end. I don't know.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.280
Where do you feel the most comfortable?

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:45.960
The first thing I feel is that I feel comfortable with the people that I've met before.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:51.800
When the restrictions first eased, do you remember what the first thing you did was?

00:27:54.600 --> 00:28:01.560
I went out for a meal and I saw my parents.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.040
Where did you go for food?

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:14.680
I forgot now. We went somewhere in town but I know that we went out for a meal on Friday afternoon

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:24.680
with my parents. We went to the the pen and wig and we had a meal with my parents.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:31.320
We went to the pen and wig and we had a meal with my parents.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:40.360
We went to the pen and wig in town so that was good to have a catch up and

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.600
just see them before we get locked away again.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:50.440
How did it feel that first time you went back out after the restrictions first got eased?

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:59.640
I felt like it was as if that I've been let out for good behaviour.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:12.840
It was great because I could have fresh air and I didn't have a time limit as to when I had to be

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:20.360
home again but just going out was the best thing because it blew all the cobwebs away.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:26.760
We were out in the fresh air and it was just great.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:32.920
Obviously although some of the restrictions have been removed now you've got to wear a mask when

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:38.200
you're in shops. You've got two metre distances and things. How did you find dealing with that?

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:49.880
Very difficult. I'm finding it hard doing the two metre distance and I'm really struggling with

00:29:49.880 --> 00:30:00.200
masks. Is that wearing them or having to talk to people who are wearing them?

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:07.800
I just feel with wearing a mask it feels like someone's constantly

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:16.840
behind you with their mouth covering your nose and mouth so you can't breathe.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:27.880
In a way to say I feel very suffocated with the mask on. I just can't breathe.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:38.200
Are you aware of things that you can do like get a lanyard that you're exempt from wearing a mask?

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:45.080
I've got a lanyard. I'm just looking for a card to go with it.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:57.320
Because I think I've seen two or three people with the actual disability

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:05.960
lanyard and the exemption card you get with it.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:15.080
I don't know where you can get them from and I'm really struggling. I've got the

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:29.160
sunflower yellow and green lanyard. I just need that card to go with it and I've got no idea where

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:34.920
to get one from. After the interview I'll give you a helpline. They might be able to help you.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.600
Okay thank you.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:46.360
Let me just have a look. I remember you saying in your original interview that one of your best

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:52.280
friends was still living in South Africa. Yes. I presume your relationship with her hasn't

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:58.360
necessarily changed that much? No it hasn't. We keep in touch almost every day.

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:09.960
Although she doesn't have a disability of any sort she's still struggling with day-to-day stuff.

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:23.960
She gets panic attacks as well. But who would get panic attacks when you're in an environment

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:36.600
like you are in this present day? Have you felt lonely at all in the last not seven months?

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:51.640
Not really. No. Because I've had Andy to hand. He's been good company. It seems weird because

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:59.480
sometimes when I'm in a relationship I sometimes think I want to be on my own. I can't wait

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:10.120
to be on my own and almost 12 months down the line I've never felt like that. I've never felt

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:19.080
like I wanted to check anyone out because I wanted time to myself which I find really strange.

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:29.480
So you're not planning to have some alone time at the moment then? Not at all. Are you worried

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:42.040
about catching the Covid-19? I am when I'm out although having the face mask does work.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:59.800
But as soon as we had lockdown I got a cold and trying to see if I could get a test

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:12.920
was really difficult. If I had a car it wouldn't be so bad but because I don't have a car and I've

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:27.320
got no one to take me it was hard to get a test as well. To get a test I'd have to pay like £160

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:35.160
something like that. For a private one is it? Well I wouldn't know if that would be a private

00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:43.080
one or just in general. The tests that everyone can get are free.

00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:50.360
So you didn't get one done did you? No I didn't.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:58.680
So you mentioned the lack of access to a car and stuff. I presume your support still helped you

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:06.360
with shopping during the first lockdown? Yes they did. Thankfully I live near a shop so

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:14.840
because support workers aren't allowed to use their cars with taking people places

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:24.200
because of not restrictions but policy that they've their new policy they've got in now.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:32.440
So we've been walking to the shop and then bringing it home.

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:44.280
So that's helped in a lot of ways but since lockdown as well I've been doing online shopping

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:50.040
which is better because you're not interacting with other people

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:58.040
which I suppose is a good thing because in that way you are saving lives.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:09.640
But I prefer going to a shop buying what you want in the store and then come home because

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.240
you know what you're getting.

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:23.240
There have been a lot of rules and regulations over our lives in the last few months. Have you

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:32.040
always understood what they are? No because it's been very confusing. It's okay for one

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:43.160
for one part of the country and then it's a different story for the next. So I don't know

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:54.360
what's true and what's not. Sorry to hear that. That must be quite difficult. It is very difficult.

00:36:55.160 --> 00:37:02.040
Do you think that your relationship with your family Andy or your friends have changed in the

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:08.920
last seven months? I don't think so. I think it's brought us closer together because

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:16.600
because of the situation we're in I think it's brought us closer.

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:26.120
It's definitely made me closer to my parents because

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:38.360
the thing is when I see them I almost cry when I say goodbye because I never know when I'm going

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:49.160
to see them again which is I don't know I really don't know how to explain that.

00:37:51.640 --> 00:38:00.520
But I just find it difficult now because we're not able to see people in the flesh.

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:06.920
I'm really struggling.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:15.800
And so do you talk to Andy about those feelings that you have? I do sometimes.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.480
Does that help? It does. It definitely helps

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:26.360
when and if you can speak to people about how you're feeling.

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.880
Do you think there's been any positive things that come out of all of this?

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:43.400
Well for me definitely getting a relationship. That's the best thing on top of my list.

00:38:43.720 --> 00:39:01.960
I don't think there's any other thing that I can think of that's different.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:10.600
And so when things return to normal or whatever normal will be now what's the one thing you're

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:19.160
looking forward to doing the most? I think seeing my mum and dad. I think they're the

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:27.000
most important people I want to see because I mean okay

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:36.520
I mean they're at the age where they're almost at retiring age so I don't know

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:46.600
it's best to take advantage when you can see them because again you don't know when

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:50.040
when you're going to see them in the long run.

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:57.400
And so I think we're nearly at the end now so is there anything else you'd like to talk about or

00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:03.000
something that you think we haven't covered? I don't think there is anything that I can think

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:11.640
of at the top of my head. Thank you very much Rhianna I'm going to stop recording now. No problem.

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.280
Let me find the button.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.280
Okay.
