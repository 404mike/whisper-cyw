00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
Carnive Carnival 25th anniversary project.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.600
Interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.200
Interviewee John, whose surname I forget.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.200
Is Bennett.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.000
Is Bennett.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Is Bennett.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Is Bennett, that's fine.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.040
We'll come to the spelling in a moment.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.320
The day today, it's the 3rd of December 2015.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.280
And the venue for the interview is the illustrious and somewhat unflamboyant Swicker office.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.280
John, would you be kind enough to spell your name in full for the record?

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.280
J-O-H-N-B-E-N-N-E-T-T.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.280
Thank you much indeed.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.280
You're a first time participant in the Carnival.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.280
We've had the pleasure of your company for one year only and that was this summer 2014.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.280
Could you tell us your story?

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.280
How did you make contact with the Carnival and tell us about your Carnival experience?

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.280
I've always loved the Carnival in Cardiff.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.280
It's always been brilliant.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.280
I've always followed it with my younger daughter.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.280
And this year I've had the opportunity to perform in it.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.280
I found out about the Carnival through my sister-in-law, Catherine Doyle.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.280
And went to the workshop and took my younger daughter, who's five now.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.280
We had a brilliant time.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.280
It was so good just to meet all the different people and to see all the different schemes taking shape from the beginning to the end.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.280
And my daughter just loved it.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.280
There was loads of different people, loads of things for little girls to play with, material and glue and glitter.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.280
It was just fabulous. It was really, really fabulous.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.280
What I did, what I made was a moon.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.280
And the idea, the scheme of our dance was the Moths following the moon.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:01.280
So I had the glory of being a big full moon with all these little Moths dancing and jumping behind me.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.280
It was amazing, absolutely amazing.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.280
I shall always think of you as a celestial body, John.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.280
So having played the moon and had an entire tribe of carnival dancing Moths around you,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.280
what plans, if any, do you have for future involvement in the carnival?

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.280
Well, I just loved every second of it.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:30.280
I loved the rhythm, I loved the dance, I loved all the people from every stage of Cardiff that got involved.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.280
I think it should be celebrated and more people should do it.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.280
Once in your life you should at least do a carnival.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.280
Next year I want to go bigger, I want to go better, I want to be more glitzy.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.280
I want to have movement, I want to have shape.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:55.280
I've seen such amazing structures being created this year, just out of string, bits of rope and materials.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.280
I want to do something like that.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.280
I want to be moving, I want to be shaking and glittering.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:10.280
So yeah, I'm not quite sure if I want to do a celestial solar scape.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.280
I'm not sure if I want to do an animal.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.280
Big, beautiful flamboyant carnival.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.280
Backpack based.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.280
Or even bike based.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.280
I like it already.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.280
I'm all for that.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.280
And something I can encourage my daughter in as well, so we can be a two person team.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.280
On a bicycle, built up with a big costume.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.280
I like it already.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.280
John, you're a carnival hero.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.280
Thank you very much for the interview.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.280
We look forward to seeing you on Two to Four Wheels with your daughter next summer.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.280
I can't wait.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.280
Take a bath.
