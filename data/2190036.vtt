I'm Vicki MacDonald and I'm in Holy Trinity Church, interviewing people as part of the

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.440
Longest Yarn. I'm with Bithig Cole and she's going to talk about her childhood during the

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.300
war in Anglesey and also other memories. Thank you Bithig. So do you want to start and tell

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.680
me a little bit about being a child during the war in Anglesey?

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:29.240
Yes. I was born in 1933, so when the war broke out I was sort of six, wasn't I? And just

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:37.080
remember the sort of fear and worry about everything. It didn't really mean much to

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:45.560
me as a child. And the things that happened, sort of the school, our schoolmaster was very,

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:58.760
very keen that we knew about the war. And this really, I can't say that we suffered terrible

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.520
hardship because we lived on the farm so we had plenty of food. But the one thing I remember

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:12.360
particularly was not being able to use the car. So we went everywhere by pony and trap.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.880
Which, you know, now I think about it, it sounds quite romantic, but if you went to

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:28.720
visit family in the evenings in the winter it was not fun. And one thing I remember that

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:36.160
was the sound of the planes because then valley was becoming quite important and there was

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.880
always the hum and it was always the, is it one of theirs or is it one of ours? You know,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:53.140
that sort of fear. And listening to the radio, always had to listen to the news, didn't you?

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.980
And there were some days when the batteries had run down. My word, that was the end of

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:10.980
the world, wasn't it? Yeah, sort of lots of interesting things. I remember this African,

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:17.860
they said she was, lady used to come around and talk to the schools. In fact, I think

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:28.980
it turned out that she was a spy that was going around. Yeah. Yeah, it's some very

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:37.860
happy things as well. One unhappy thing, unfortunately, was my father died in 1943. Died suddenly,

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:47.860
had septicemia. That was quite a change in our lives. But when I talk to other people,

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:55.460
as I said, I married a man from Kent and when he talks about, talked about his experiences,

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.900
their life was so different from ours. He talks about spending sort of half their nights

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.460
in shelters and, you know, all these bombs falling around them and that sort of thing.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:17.260
We did have a few bombs in Anglesey, but nothing to speak of really. And one big event I remembered

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:25.740
was that a plane came down on a farm about three miles from us. And I suppose it was

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:32.860
a Spitfire or something, because I remember thinking it wasn't very big. You know, for a

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.940
sort of six-year-old to think that, it can't have been very big, can it? But everybody was there

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:47.340
around it, you know. And I suppose, really, that was one of the sort of biggest events that I can

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.660
remember. So did your mother cope on the farm on her own or did she have family who you could get

00:03:53.740 --> 00:04:00.940
in? She coped for two years and then she remarried. And yes, she did. She did cope. She was an amazing

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.220
woman, really. It must have been very hard because you were in the middle of a war and your father

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:16.780
had died suddenly. Yes, it was. But in those days, I don't know, children worked. And I can

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:24.060
not remember, not working, really. I used to sort of go and feed the pigs, sort of, and even doing

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:33.340
milking at eight years old. So it was hard, but I suppose because my mother was such a strong woman,

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.540
she made life easy for us, really. That sounds amazing. And thank you so much.
