Church of All Saints and the Pheasant. The Church of All Saints, Penn of Ai, was

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.640
built between 1900 and 1903 by Robert Llewellyn of Court Coleman. The church

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.360
was so named because Llewellyn's eldest son was born on All Saints Day, the 1st

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.800
of November. It's a grade 2 listed building along with the church lodge and

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.720
the school lodge. All three of these buildings were built by Llewellyn between

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.760
1898 and 1903 at the former entrance to Court Coleman Manor. Across the road is

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.440
the Pheasant Public House, now owned by the Brains Brewery chain. The pub is also

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.040
a grade 2 listed building. In an earlier life it was simply T. Mower Farmhouse, a

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.800
sub-medieval hall and parlour house built in the 16th century. Then in 1967 the

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.600
building was modernized and converted into the public house it is today.
