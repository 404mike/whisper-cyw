00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Barbie.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Which one now? That's the question.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Gosselmanie. I know we've got the rugby ones.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Yeah, football.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The football ones.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Music.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Definitely the music ones. The college ones.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I would say I would hold on to the rugby and football one and plus the beat the new one

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
there, FIFA with England's woman.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I played as the best women's team in Brazil and I lost.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Yeah, what was the score Al?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
2-1.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Cracking for your kick winner.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Yeah, 2-1.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I think the memory I would hold on for both of us I would say is probably when we go play pool or snooker

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and watching the football matches together in the rugby.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I think it's because we kind of make the most of the day.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We won't just go there for an hour or two, we go out for a day to go play football, have lunch and then

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
do something to have a couple of beverages.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Religion's been a friendship, you know.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Because I think that's what kind of enabled us to talk to each other about a bit more then to get that

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
kind of key across of when do you want to go and take our friendship bit step further to go to a match together.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It is, yeah.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So, 2020 this year, it was me, you and Kimi.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
That was a good day.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
That's one of the memories because I was up with you and Kimi at the time.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Plus, you've never been to a match with my girlfriend until then.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
You've seen your loss that day.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Yeah, managed to just sit a couple of rows opposite each other.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Yeah, it was not far, it was a couple of blocks actually.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So, we were quite lucky, we were quite close together.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:22.000
But, I think that, I think, it's a lot of memories but I think that one stands out for me that I think

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
football will agree that it's a key to our friendship.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
A very long one.
