00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800
This is Vicki speaking from Holy Trinity Church, Llandudno, collecting memories at the Longest Yarn.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:14.600
I have Neil with me who is going to share stories about his great-uncle, Harry.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.800
Thank you, Neil. Perhaps I can just say thank you for speaking to me. That's lovely today.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.800
So, if you'd like to share your memories of your great-uncle Harry.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.800
So, he fought with the South Staffs, South Staffordshire Regiment in North Africa.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.800
So, fighting against Rommel in the desert.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:43.600
After they'd fought through North Africa, they fought up through Italy.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.000
So, landed on Sicily, I think they did first.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.600
And then they went on to the mainland and fought their way up through Italy.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.200
And it was at Montecassino.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.400
And did he survive all this?

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.600
He did, yeah. He died in his, I think he was about 88 when he died. So, he did alright.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.000
And did he share his memories with his family?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.000
A little bit, yeah. I remember him talking about Montecassino, saying that they all had to wear orange bibs on their backpacks

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
because the Americans were strafing them out and so to identify, which they still do today.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.400
They did it in the Gulf War. They had markings on the tanks.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.400
To avoid friendly fire?

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.400
Yeah, friendly fire, blue on blue.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.400
So, yeah, they all wore orange tabards on their backpacks.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.400
He said it didn't help much.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.400
There was some friendly fire?

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:42.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Towards the end of the war, he was in a guard in a prisoner of war cap.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:50.400
And I remember him talking about an SS officer who said nobody liked him, not even the Germans.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:59.400
And he said, oh, we've got a saying in the Wehrmacht where it says, if the RAF gap come across, then we get down.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:06.400
And if the Luftwaffe come across, you get down. And if the Americans come across, everybody gets down.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.400
Which I thought was quite amusing.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.400
It's amazing, isn't it?

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.400
It still happens today.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.400
So he came back home and he survived and he lived to a ripe old age, you say?

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.400
I think he was 88, I think.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.400
That's amazing. Oh, thank you.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.400
He was good fun.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.400
Yeah, he was. Well, that's good because some of them came back and buried their memories, didn't they?

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.400
They did.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.400
I've got another great uncle.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.400
He was a great uncle.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.400
He was a great uncle.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.400
He was a great uncle.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.400
He was born in Hereford, Victor Pugh, and he served in the RAF.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:51.400
These memories about his other great uncle were too difficult for Neil to continue, so we'll finish the interview.
