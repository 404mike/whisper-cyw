00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
First of all, all the children we used to play with,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
either ignored us or threw stones at us,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
or just called us Jew.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Well, for a child who doesn't know what the difference is between a Christian and Jew,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
except that they went to a church, we went to a synagogue.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And it hurt because we'd been friends, and I was only four years old.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And the main memory was the fact that my father's best friend was the village policeman.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And I remember being a very nosy child, coming down one night hearing voices.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And there was the village policeman and my father, the policeman who we called Uncle,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
saying to my father,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Julius, don't talk to me in the street because I can't talk to you.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
If I shouted, you'll forgive me.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Tell the children they mustn't even call me Uncle.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Because he said, I have to wear this dreadful uniform,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I have a family, and I have to live here.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And for the first time in my young life, I discovered that men could cry.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I never knew that. I knew I could cry when I was hurt, but for men to cry, that I didn't know.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And that was the greatest shock of all,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
the fact that these two big, strong men could cry.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And then I realized why.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
When he said, tell the children that they mustn't call me Uncle,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and if I shouted to them, tell them, please take no note.
