Felly, beth wnaethach chi yna pan ydych chi'n ddod i Ysgol?

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.560
Roeddwn yn gweithio fel sefydliadwr,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.560
yn trefnu fel sefydliadwr ymddygiad yn y ffaerau goughledd London Pride.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:05.560
Now, London Pride was based in, just outside Bridgend, Brackla, on the Brackla estate.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:13.560
Did you have to have an interview? Yes, yes. I went along for an interview.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:22.560
I think I did anyway. I can't remember to be honest. I must have had an interview or the decision must have been made.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:31.560
You know, you went along and asked for a job. And you went into a training school then to train as a machinist.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:40.560
So how long was the training for? I think it was about six weeks. I think it was about six weeks.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:48.560
Where you only made collars and cuffs. That's all you did. You were taught how to use the machine.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:04:00.560
And they made all the collars and cuffs for the blouses we were making. So it was quite boring, you know, just making those. Same thing.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:09.560
Sorry, was it a good training though, do you think? Oh yes, yes, excellent. Yes, it was.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:17.560
So describe to me then that first day you walked into the factory, what was it like? What was the sound, the smell, the, you know, everything like?

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:27.560
Very overwhelming. It was absolutely nerve-racking. You had to be in the factory by 7.30 to start work.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:37.560
And you had to be sitting at your machine at 7.30. And I can remember, I can remember it must have been either the first or the first week anyway.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:45.560
I kept looking at the clock and thinking, you know, the day was never going to end. It seemed such a long, long day.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:59.560
Because we didn't finish work until 5 o'clock in the evening. We had a 10 minute break in the morning, half an hour for lunch and then a 10 minute break in the afternoon.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:11.560
But each time the break, you only went when the bell rang and you had to be back on your machine by the time the finishing bell for the break to be over.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:23.560
You had to be back on your machine. If you wanted to go to the loo, you had to put your hand up. If there was someone else in the loo, then you had to wait until that person came back.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:31.560
So you couldn't go to the loo the same time as anyone else off that line. You had to wait your turn.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.560
So were they quite strict, you think?

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:41.560
Oh, very strict, yes. Yes. No swearing. You weren't allowed to swear. If anyone was caught swearing, they were sent home.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.560
Forever or just?

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:51.560
Oh no, no. No, but they would be sent home. Yes, yes. It was very strict. It was very prim and proper.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.560
Right.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:00.560
Everyone wore overalls and everyone...

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:10.560
Well, I'm not saying... Oh, the singing. We used to sing all day because we'd listen to the radio in the morning and the radio would come on.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:20.560
I think it was around about eight o'clock the radio came on and at nine o'clock it was a programme with all the local pop music.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:27.560
So we'd all sing along to that. Then the radio would go off at eleven o'clock and come back on at one o'clock.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:34.560
And at one o'clock it was... I think it was called Worker's Playtime at one o'clock.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:45.560
And there'd be a comedian or a local artist, you know, well, quite famous artist, not local, at one o'clock.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:52.560
So everybody would enjoy that. Then it would go off again then. And I don't think it came back on in the afternoon.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:59.560
That was all we were allowed on the radio. But the radio took off the monotony of the work, you know.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.560
So do you think it helped then?

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.560
Oh yes, very much so.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.560
Were you allowed to talk when you were on the machines?

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:14.560
No, you weren't allowed to talk. You weren't allowed to chat. That was taboo.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:24.560
I can remember one particular day I was standing at the side of the machine because the girl that I was talking to was doing buttonholes.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:31.560
She was buttonholing. Then she would hand the garment to me and I would mark for the buttons.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:36.560
So we were chatting away, working at the same time, but chatting away and laughing.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:43.560
And I looked up and I caught the eye of the managed dress, Mrs. Taylor her name was.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:49.560
And she came to work in a navy blue suit with a white blouse every day in a taxi.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:58.560
And her office had glass windows all the way around it. So she could see every part of the factory floor from her office.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:05.560
And I looked up like that and caught her eye. And she came straight out of the office, straight over to me and said,

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:11.560
Go back to your machine. She said and stopped laughing and giggling.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.560
I was shaking my shoes.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.560
Oh yes, I was going to say, how did you feel that somebody had been talking to you?

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:29.560
Oh, it was terrible, terrible. And of course then the supervisor came up and she told me off because the supervisor also had a telling off from the managed dress because I was laughing.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.560
But you were just simply passing the time of day, you were still working.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:40.560
That's the kind of atmosphere it was, you know, very strict.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.560
Did you worry about losing your job?

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.560
Oh yes, yes you did.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.560
Did people lose their jobs for being disruptive or laughing?

00:08:51.560 --> 00:09:01.560
Yes, yes. Yes, if you didn't do your work, you know, if you weren't pulling your weight, then you would lose your job, yes.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:07.560
Because you had to keep up on a line, you see, on a production line.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:16.560
So if you didn't keep up, or you were chatting and laughing or not keeping up on the line, then you would lose your job.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:25.560
Because it was a production line. There was a belt running down the middle of the production line and the garment came down on the belt.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:32.560
You took it off, did you a part of the work on it, put it back on the belt for the next person.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:40.560
So it was a continuous line all the time. You had to keep up.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.560
So you did these collars and cuffs for six weeks.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.560
Yes.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.560
What did you do then?

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:51.560
I went out onto the finishing line then, where the garment was actually finished.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:59.560
The garment went onto a production line to be made up, the side seams, all of those sleeves put in, everything like that.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:06.560
But then it came to the finishing line where I was working because I was just starting out.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:16.560
You didn't go on the actual production line until you'd been working there quite some time and that you were really proficient then.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:21.560
So on the finishing line it was a much easier sort of work.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:32.560
You had a machine sewing the buttons on, a machine doing the button holes, a machine doing the bottom hems, all that kind of thing.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:42.560
The whole garment would be examined and the ends all cut off. It would go on to be pressed.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.560
Then a final examination on a model.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.560
A live model?

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:52.560
No, a mannequin.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:11:00.560
Do you know who you were making these for? What were you making and who were you making them for?

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:11.560
They were blouses made out of a print called Liberty Loan and Viola.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:17.560
They were four, well it was a very upmarket garment.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:27.560
They went to all the big stores in London because at that time they were costing something like £60, the blouse,

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:33.560
which would be expensive now. But at that time it was a fortune.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.560
How much were you earning?

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:45.560
Well when I started work, I've asked my friend this now and we've discussed it and we think it was £1.076.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:49.560
That's how much we started work on.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:12:01.560
I can't remember the hours now. It would be over 40 hours a week. But it was £1.76.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:12.560
Out of that we had to pay bus fare and give my mum some and then what was left was mine, which wasn't much.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:17.560
They were long hours weren't they? You said you started at half seven?

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.560
Yes, half seven until five in the evening.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.560
How much of a lunch break did you have?

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.560
Half an hour.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.560
Very long hours.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.560
It was very long hours.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:35.560
So did your wages go up when you stopped being a trainee?

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:43.560
Slightly, yes you did. You had a small amount more then.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:51.560
I think when you went on to the full production line you earned a little bit more as well.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.560
Were you on piecework at all?

00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:01.560
No, it wasn't a piecework. It was flat wage.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:08.560
Were you all on the same wage or were you aware of some people having more?

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.560
No, everybody was on the same.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.560
And did your wages go up every year then?

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:20.560
Not every year, no. I can't remember it going up every year.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.560
No, I can't. I can't remember it going up every year.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:35.560
The one incident I can remember though, because the company was owned by, I think they were a London based, and it was a Jewish company.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:40.560
And it was the anniversary of the owner.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:48.560
So they sent around a box for us to put money in to buy an anniversary present for the owner.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:58.560
And I can remember that they bought a silver candelabra for the owner of the factory for their anniversary.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.560
Incredible.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.560
I'm going to read it from the 1.7 and 6 that we're doing here.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:16.560
So, when you went to work at London Pride, did you know anybody working there?

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.560
Did you know any girls from school or any other members of the family?

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:29.560
No, it was my friend and I started together. We both went, and we both started on the same day.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.560
And a school friend?

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.560
Yes.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.560
Oh, right.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.560
Yes, so I had company.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.560
I can't, no, I don't think I did know anyone else working there.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:47.560
It was just that we must have known that they were taking on people, and we both wanted to do so.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:52.560
And we just both started work together.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.560
How many people worked there when you went to work there?

00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:02.560
Well, I think there was about four lines of 50 people, so that would have been about 200.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:08.560
Then there would have been the training school. I expect there was about 300 people working there.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.560
And these were mainly women, were they?

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.560
Mainly women, yes.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.560
And were there any men working there then?

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:23.560
Only the mechanics who looked after the machinery and the people in the kitchen room.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:32.560
There were men working in the kitchen room and in the dispatch area, where the products went out to the factory.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.560
Were they all men in the kitchen room?

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:43.560
Mostly, yes, mostly. The odd girls. In fact, my friend did end up working in the kitchen room.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.560
Because she never went onto the machine.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:54.560
So did your job remain kind of the same while you were there?

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.560
Yes.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:16:02.560
And did you find the work, you know, was it satisfying or was it...?

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:07.560
No, far from it. It was so boring.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.560
Was it?

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:20.560
Yes, because you only did one part of it. You know, you didn't do a complete item. It was so boring. Yeah, bored me to death.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.560
What kept you going then? Was it the other women?

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:30.560
The money. The thought at the end of the week we'd have our wages.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:36.560
But what about the other women? Was there a good gang working there?

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:42.560
Very, yes, yes, there were. Yes, the camaraderie was brilliant in those kind of places.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:51.560
Because you all went to the same dance halls on the weekend. We'd go to the Palais in Bridgend and we'd all meet each other there.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.560
Yes, it was a lovely camaraderie.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.560
Was there any social events arranged by the factory?

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:06.560
Not in that particular factory. I never remembered going to any there. Not at that particular one.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.560
What about day trips and stuff like that?

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:16.560
No, no. I can't remember ever going on anything organised through the factory.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:23.560
What about your holidays then? Were you given paid holidays and do you remember what they were?

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:27.560
Yes, we were. We were given paid holidays.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:34.560
I'm not sure, but I think it was bank holiday. You'd have one day for bank holidays.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:41.560
And I think Christmas time, we used to have two days for Christmas.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:45.560
What about an annual summer holiday then?

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:51.560
Yes, I think it was a week. I think it was seven days, yeah, one week.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:56.560
And did you have a choice when to take it or did the factory shut down?

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:03.560
The factory shut down. Completely. Everybody took the same. I'm not sure if it was two weeks.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.560
The same time as the miners' holiday?

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.560
Yes, yes.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:14.560
Do you remember what you did on those holidays? Do you remember going anywhere?

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:25.560
Not in particular, no. Only perhaps on the train. We'd go on the train to Puthcol or to Cardiff.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:33.560
Yes, we used to go to—I can remember going on the train, getting on the train in Llanharren and going to Cardiff.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:37.560
And going to Rhoath Park on the lake.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:43.560
Rhoath Park for a holiday.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:48.560
Oh, Barry Island. We used to go to Barry Island, yes. We did.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.560
Perhaps a group of us would meet up and go.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.560
So you went with friends from work, did you?

00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:01.560
Not particularly from work, no. My one best friend, we always went together.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:09.560
But there might have been perhaps a group of 10, 12 of us go. All from the same sort of social group.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.560
And how did you go then, did you say?

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:20.560
On the train, yes. Because the train was actually stopping in Llanharren then.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.560
So we'd go on the train.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.560
All the way to Barry Island?

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:31.560
Yes, yes. And Puthcol. It actually went into Puthcol then.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:36.560
That's the only places I can remember going.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:41.560
And my friend and I did go to Liverpool to my sister.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:48.560
And we stayed with her. I think we stayed there a week. With my sister and her husband.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:53.560
We went up on the train on our own, which was a huge adventure then.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:57.560
Because we had to change in crew.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:02.560
How on earth we got to Liverpool, I'll never know.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:08.560
So tell me then about unions. Were there any unions in the factory?

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.560
Yes.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:10.560
Were you all members?

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.560
Yes.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:16.560
And can you remember any disputes or anything?

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:29.560
Not in the first, not in London Pride, no. Later on, yes later on, sorry towards the 70s, but not when I first started work.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:35.560
So what were the conditions like in London Pride?

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:42.560
Well, you know, it was clean. And it was clean work.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:48.560
There was a canteen where you could go and eat and it was a nice clean atmosphere.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:54.560
It wasn't, you didn't come home filthy dirty or anything.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.560
And you could buy, you could actually buy the material.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:07.560
So my friend and I, if they were selling the material, we'd buy the material and we'd go home and we'd make a new outfit to go out on Saturday.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:16.560
So we'd have a, we loved it. We'd have a new outfit nearly every week because we bought the material, quite reasonable off cuts.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:20.560
And went home and sold it and had a new outfit to go out.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:21.560
And was it good material?

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.560
Very, yes.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:32.560
What about the actual garments? Were they ever, you know, were there any sort of seconds of garments you could, you know?

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:40.560
Yes, you could, I think. You could buy the garments, the seconds, but they were still too expensive for us to buy.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.560
We couldn't afford to buy the seconds even.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:48.560
No, we'd buy the material and make them ourselves.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:22:00.560
You said it was a clean factory, but was it too hot or too cold or anything? Do you remember any issues like that?

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:06.560
No, not really. In the summer, we'd open all the windows.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:13.560
I can't remember it being, I mean, in the mornings, it was very cold in the mornings going to work because it was so early.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:20.560
And when you went into the factory, obviously it was cold going into the factory in the morning.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:29.560
But it was never, it never seemed to be overly cold or overly hot. Not that particular factory.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.560
The conditions were quite good.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:39.560
Yes. And what about the facilities, the toilets, the things?

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.560
Yes, yes.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.560
Was that quite good as well?

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:49.560
Yes, yes. Compared to what I experienced further on in my working life, yes.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:56.560
And were you aware, was the work at all dangerous?

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:05.560
No. Only in the fact that you watched your fingers, getting your fingers caught in the needles and things like that, you know.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:16.560
You could get your finger caught in the needle because there were electric-operated machines, particularly the sort of the buttonhole machine.

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.560
You made sure you kept your fingers away.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.560
So you don't remember any bad accidents or anything?

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.560
No, no.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.560
Were you made aware of health and safety?

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:30.560
Oh no, no. No, there was unheard of then in those days.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:38.560
We did have a restroom in London Pride, though. There was a restroom there for people who were really ill and they'd take you there.

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:44.560
I can remember one particular day I must have had a migraine headache.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:52.560
And I ended up, I went to the toilet and I was so ill I started, I must have started crying and they took me to the restroom.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.560
And I stayed in the restroom for an hour.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:03.560
So, you know, the conditions weren't horrendous or anything there.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.560
Did they pay you for that hour?

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.560
Yes, yes they did. Yes.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:14.560
Was there any other kind of sick pay or if you know?

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:18.560
No, no. You didn't go to work, you didn't have money.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.560
Right.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.560
Okay.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:26.560
Anything else you want to say about London Pride?

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.560
I'll just...

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.560
Yeah, I wanted to ask you about, like...

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:46.560
Were you mainly younger women in London Pride or were there older women and were there married women?

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:50.560
No, it was quite a mixed age group.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.560
There were older women there.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:58.560
And I can particularly remember older single women.

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:04.560
There were a number of older single women there.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.560
Not so much married as single.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.560
Right.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.560
And did you all do the same kind of work?

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.560
Yes, yes, they all did the same kind of work.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:21.560
Did they pick the supervisors out of the workforce or did they bring people in?

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:25.560
No, they were picked out of the workforce. Yes.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:31.560
What about if you did have a family?

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.560
Were there childcare facilities there?

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.560
Oh, I knew it off.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:41.560
Childcare? No one worked if they had children. No, there was no childcare.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.560
Did anybody come back to work if they'd had children?

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.560
No.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:47.560
Really? No.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.560
Was that something that the management wouldn't have wanted or was it just...

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.560
They wouldn't have wanted and they wouldn't have cared for.

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.560
Really?

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.560
Because there would be no facilities.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:26:03.560
And you wouldn't have been allowed to take time off if your children were ill or if there were school problems or anything like that.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.560
You wouldn't have been allowed to take time off.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.560
No, no, I never knew anyone working with children.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.560
No, I didn't know anyone working with children.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:21.560
What about if you had to take time off for a personal reason like a funeral, was that allowed?

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:29.560
Yes, you would have been able to take probably for funeral, I'm not sure, but you wouldn't have been paid for it.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:35.560
You wouldn't have been paid for anything other than what you were working for.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.560
I don't know.

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:41.560
Anything else was deducted from your weekly wage.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.560
Right.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:51.560
Were you aware, you said that a lot of the clothes were sent to big London shops.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:59.560
Were you aware of anyone else they were sent, like local stores down in Cardiff?

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:05.560
Yes, yes, the James Howell store in Cardiff stocked them.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:13.560
And I can remember seeing advertisements in magazines and things like that.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:20.560
And they would be advertised in the magazines, you know, in the expensive magazines.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:27.560
If you were in maybe a dental surgery and you saw a magazine, they would be advertised in there.

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:33.560
So you were well aware of how much they cost, of the price of the garments.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.560
Do you remember the first time you realised how much they were?

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:42.560
No, no, because I always knew that they were expensive.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:43.560
Excitational.

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.560
Yes, yes.

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.560
Right.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.560
So, how did you get to work?

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.560
Oh, on the bus.

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.560
And how much of a trip was it?

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:10.560
It took approximately half an hour to get to work because the bus left Llanharren at half past six in the morning.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:20.560
And you had to be at the bus stop to get the bus at half past six because London Pride was actually outside Bridgend.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.560
So it wasn't on the normal bus route.

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:35.560
If you missed the bus that was going that way, you had to go into Bridgend and then out from Bridgend to Coiti, which took perhaps another half an hour.

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:41.560
So you were always aware that you had to catch the half past six bus.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.560
And there was public transport, wasn't there?

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.560
Public transport, yes.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.560
Yes.

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.560
From the bus.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.560
From the bus?

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.560
From the bus from Weston Welsh.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.560
Oh, right.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:51.560
Yes.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:52.560
Oh, yes, Weston Welsh.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:58.560
And did people come from far and wide to London Pride?

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:06.560
More or less, I think, within a sort of, I would say, 20 mile radius.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:20.560
There were people from right up Nanty Mall and Diogmobil Valleys, as far down as Brynceethyn, Pencoed, Llanharren.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.560
No further than Llanharren, I would have thought.

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:26.560
So it would have been less than 20 mile radius.

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.560
So nobody from up Pantypridd?

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.560
No, no.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.560
So fairly local.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.560
Yes.

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.560
Fairly local, yes.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:50.560
So, when did you decide to leave and why?

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:54.560
I think I left after about two years.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:59.560
So I would have been 15, 16, coming up to 17.

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.560
And I wanted to earn more money.

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:07.560
And my other friend was working in the glove factory and she was on piecework.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.560
And she earned more than what I did.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:14.560
And she told me there was jobs going, so I applied.

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:20.560
And I went to work in the glove factory in Llanfairstdd, then, which was piecework.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:29.560
So you only earned what you worked, you know, you had a piece rate for the job.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.560
So if you worked hard, you'd earn more.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:36.560
Did you have a basic wage?

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:39.560
It wasn't called a basic wage.

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:45.560
In fact, there was a basic limit.

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:52.560
But if you didn't earn that basic limit, then, you know, you were in big trouble.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:59.560
Because you had to earn the basic limit and then anything else on top was the bonus rate.

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.560
So what was it called, the glove factory?

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:06.560
It was called Planet Gloves.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:11.560
And it was based in Llanfdrasant in the old model house.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:15.560
And I worked on the top floor.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:23.560
So that was, I think that was half past seven start again.

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.560
You had to be there for half past seven.

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:32.560
And I travelled by the local bus service that went up into Llanfdrasant.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:40.560
So we'd start work at half past seven, but the manageress didn't come until, I think it was eight o'clock she started work.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:45.560
So from half past seven until eight o'clock, it was riots.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:49.560
It was such good fun, laughing and joking.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:57.560
But someone would always be on the lookout to see the manageress' car coming up the street, because you could see it from the windows.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:03.560
So they'd shout, Mrs. Coat is on her way. That's it.

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:08.560
Heads down. And from the moment she walked in through the door, you're a pin drop.

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:12.560
You don't hear the hem of the machines going.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:15.560
We're like children.

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:20.560
So, how many of you worked in planet gloves then?

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:28.560
I think it was about 150 people, something like that, 200.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.560
Oh, still a lot of people.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:40.560
Yes, on different levels. Right the way through the, they cut the gloves on the bottom, you know, and brought in the leather and cut them.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:45.560
And then they went up to another level where there were offices on one part.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:53.560
And then there was different styles of gloves, ladies' and men's gloves on different levels, you know, in different rooms.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.560
Yeah.

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:08.560
So, did you have training to go and work in planet gloves, or could you use the training you'd had already?

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:17.560
Well, the training I'd had already opened the door for me to go to another place where I would use sewing machines,

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:24.560
because once you'd been trained on one sewing machine, you could adapt to different kinds of machine,

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:36.560
because a glove-making machine is a specialised sewing machine in the fact that the one I was using, it had a sort of stem on it.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:48.560
So you sort of sewed on the top of the stem for to be able to get the angle of the gloves, you know, to put the fingers in and the thumbs in.

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:56.560
Right, right. Did you have to go for an interview for that, or was it just sort of, you just applied and?

00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:00.560
I think I just applied and they said start whatever it is.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.560
What about references from the interviews?

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.560
No, no.

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.560
Nothing like that?

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:06.560
No, no references.

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.560
Just left one and started another?

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:09.560
Yes.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.560
Did you have to give much notice in?

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:14.560
A week, you'd have to give a week's notice.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.560
So it was quite a mobile workforce then?

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.560
Yes.

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:26.560
Can you describe your first day at planet gloves then, what was that like? I mean, how did it compare to London's time?

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:44.560
It was much more, the work was much harder. It was sort of, your hands became stained with the leather and the conditions in the factory,

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:52.560
Although it wasn't really dirty or anything, they weren't as clean as London Pride.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:35:00.560
The work wasn't as nice, you know, in the fact that it was, I don't know how to describe this.

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:11.560
London Pride, you were making nice things, you know, feminine things, but in the glove factory it wasn't so feminine.

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.560
Leather's dirty, isn't it?

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:23.560
Yes, yes. And the, I mean, you still, there was still a code of practice, you weren't allowed to swear.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:35.560
In fact, the girl in the picture that I showed you there, we were talking about this last week, she swore and the manager heard her and sent her home.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:39.560
She had to go home because she'd sworn.

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.560
And how long was she at home for?

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:42.560
For the day.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:43.560
For the day.

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:49.560
Yes, she sent her home that day and she came back the next day, but that was because she was swearing.

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:55.560
And there was only two toilets, there was only two ladies' toilets.

00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:05.560
If you wanted to go to the toilet, you had to go, you had to put your hand up and go and get a key to open the door to go into the toilet.

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:08.560
Well, everyone smoked!

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:12.560
You weren't supposed to smoke in the ladies' toilets.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:17.560
So we'd open the window, we'd hang out to the window to smoke.

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:23.560
But in the toilets was the machine to dispose of the sanitary towels.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:28.560
And the smoke coming off there and the smell was horrendous.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:36.560
So you'd be hanging out to the window trying to smoke a cigarette with all the smoke coming off the towel machine.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:41.560
Do you reckon the smell of the smell now? Oh, it was horrendous.

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:43.560
So the facilities there weren't as good then?

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:44.560
No.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.560
What about a canteen? Did you have a canteen?

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:51.560
The canteen was on the ground floor and we worked on the top floor.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:59.560
You had ten minutes to come down three flights of stairs to the canteen.

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:08.560
And you know, it's a funny thing, but if I'm faced with a long flight of stairs, even now, I'll still do it.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.560
Hold onto the sides and slide down the stairs.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:16.560
And that's how we used to come down, because it was the fastest way to get down.

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:22.560
So that you'd get in the queue to have your tea and your toast, or whatever it is you'd ordered.

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:29.560
Because you had to be back up on your machine by the time the buzzer went for the end of the break.

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.560
And how many flights up were you?

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:35.560
Another two flights up the stairs. Three, three flights. Three flights.

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:41.560
Yeah, because there's three levels in Model House and the stairs are so narrow.

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:47.560
When I went there recently, because it's a craft shop now and I don't know if you've ever been in there.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.560
No, I haven't.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:53.560
Well, those narrow stairs are still there.

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:57.560
I was really tempted to slide down them.

00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:00.560
So how much time did you have for lunch there?

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:04.560
Half an hour. Only half an hour.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:08.560
And afternoon break?

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:13.560
Do you know, I don't think we had an afternoon break there.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:19.560
I think I only had a morning break and a lunch break.

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:23.560
If we had an afternoon break, I think we used to sit at our machines.

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.560
We didn't go down to—no, that's right.

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:33.560
If we wanted an afternoon break there, I think we sat at our machines and just had a break.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.560
We never went to the canteen because—

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.560
Too far.

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:42.560
I don't think it was open. I think it only did morning breaks and lunch.

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:46.560
I can never remember going there in the afternoon.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:50.560
I can never remember having an afternoon break.

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:51.560
Not there.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:55.560
How many hours did you work when you were at Planet Close?

00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:01.560
Well, that would have been the same. Half past seven start until five o'clock in the evening.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:02.560
Long hours.

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:06.560
Yes, very long hours.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:11.560
And was it unionized then?

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.560
No, there was no union there.

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:20.560
Oh, right. Okay. So what happened if there was a dispute?

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.560
How did you settle?

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.560
I can't ever remember there being a dispute.

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:31.560
If you didn't like something or you thought something wasn't right,

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:38.560
you just went to the manageress and explained the situation to her.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:47.560
Or tried to—but it was very strict in the fact that if you didn't like what you had, then it's tough luck.

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:49.560
You take it or leave it.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:51.560
They weren't sympathetic at all then?

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:52.560
No.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.560
No.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:59.560
Would you say they were good employers on the whole, or were they not very good employers?

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:02.560
No, I wouldn't have said they were good employers.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:06.560
The welfare of the employers were of no consequence.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:11.560
I haven't said that. I can't say they weren't really good.

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:15.560
Because Iris Williams, the singer, she worked there.

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:20.560
Now, Iris, when we started singing, because we always used to sing,

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:25.560
but Iris always wanted to sing something operatic.

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:29.560
And of course we always wanted to sing the pop songs.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:35.560
So if Iris started to sing these to him or something like that, we drowned her out with the pop song.

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:49.560
But I did get to hear that the manageress had actually encouraged Iris to go to the Royal School of Music, you know, the Royal College.

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:50.560
Right.

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.560
So—

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.560
Had they backed her financially?

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:53.560
Yes, I think so.

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.560
What, the firm or—

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:56.560
Yes.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.560
—personally?

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:00.560
No, I think it was her actually personally did it.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:01.560
Right.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:08.560
So, you know, she was quite nice, she was. Mrs. Cote her name was.

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:12.560
Mr. and Mrs. Cote, they were husband and wife.

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:19.560
And I think she would have been all right, but of course someone else owned the actual factory.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.560
She was just the manageress.

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.560
Yes.

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:29.560
Unless she had—I don't know. She may have had shares in the company, I don't know.

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:36.560
What about—what about compared to London Pride? Do you think London Pride were good employers?

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:46.560
For the time, I suppose they were. For that time in history, you know.

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:47.560
Good but strict?

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:59.560
Yes. Oh, yes, there was a standard there, you know. If you worked there, it wasn't—you knew that you had to behave in a certain way.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:07.560
So, tell me about Iris Williams, and where did she come from?

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.560
She came from Tonnerewil.

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:10.560
Ah, right.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:16.560
I think she was adopted or fostered in Tonnerewil.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:22.560
And she was there for how long when you were there?

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:26.560
Two or three years, yes, two to three years.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.560
And then did she go off to college then?

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:34.560
I think she went to college then because I think when I left there, I was there for about two years.

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:47.560
And then it was—it closed about two years after that, and Iris went from there then, and she did—she started her singing career then because that was her ambition.

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:53.560
I mean, there was no doubt about it that Iris was going to sing. Yeah.

00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:59.560
So were there more kind of girls from, like, Pontypridd way, Rhondda way in—

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:01.560
The Rhondda, mostly the Rhondda.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.560
Right.

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:10.560
Yes. Tonnerewil, Llandrisund, byddai. Yes, that area.

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:13.560
And how did they get it?

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.560
All public transport.

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:16.560
Yes.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:17.560
Yes.

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:20.560
And no one had a car then?

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:25.560
No, no. And it was all paid out of your own wages then?

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:26.560
Yes.

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:29.560
Do you remember what your wages were then? You said you were on piecework.

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:43.560
I think I went there and I had—I can remember my—I can remember taking home something like £3 to £4 from there because I worked on piecework.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:58.560
And I was quite a fast worker. And I always only perhaps took 15 minutes for my lunch, and then I'd go back and I'd sit at my machine and do all the cutting and things.

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:05.560
I'd do the sewing and then leave those for my break for doing the cutting part.

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:11.560
So that would make it faster for me. So I earned more then.

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:21.560
So I was quite a fast worker and I was one of—I think I was one of the top earners.

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:25.560
I was going to say it suited you in a way then, the piecework.

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:31.560
Yes. Yes, it did. Because I wanted to earn more money.

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:40.560
So what about holidays and things there? Do you remember what the holidays were in Planniglefs?

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.560
It was the same as mine as holidays.

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:44.560
Right.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:52.560
Yes. But only sort of the bank holidays. You'd only have the actual bank holiday past the two days.

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:55.560
And did you do the same kind of things?

00:44:55.560 --> 00:45:00.560
Yes. Yes, we never went on holiday. I never ever went away on holiday.

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:05.560
Did you know any of the girls when you went to—oh, you said a friend here?

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:06.560
Yes.

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:07.560
Did you know anybody else?

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:17.560
Yes, there was quite a few local people. Not that I knew them personally, but I knew—I sort of acquainted with them.

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:20.560
What was the camaraderie like in Planniglefs?

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:27.560
Oh, brilliant. Yes. They were a funny crowd, you know, so funny. Such good laughs.

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:37.560
Like I related the incident where if you went to the law, because you were sitting on a hard seat, you'd have a cushion on the seat.

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:44.560
And there was one particular girl who, if you went to the law, she'd put a needle in the cushion,

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:52.560
and you'd come back from school to sit on the cushion, and you'd shoot off that cushion a bit sharp.

00:45:52.560 --> 00:46:00.560
But you just laughed about it, because although I'm thinking about it now, they were quite sharp needles.

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.560
But they'd do things like that, you know, silly things. Pranks.

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:04.560
Pranks.

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:08.560
Yes. Yeah. Always doing pranks.

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:11.560
So were you very close to your co-workers then?

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.560
Yes, I think we were.

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:19.560
What kind of things did you do? Did you go out together?

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:21.560
Yes, to the local dance halls.

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:24.560
The same dance halls as you went to before?

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:31.560
No, no. That was going towards Bridgen now. Now I changed my area, now we went to Llanhari.

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:40.560
Sometimes one particular person would organise the bus, and we'd go to the Sapphire Gardens in Cardiff,

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:50.560
or the Padgett Runes in P'n Arth, especially an organised coach, and we'd go to dance halls like that.

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:53.560
I can remember going to those.

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:59.560
So do you remember what year it was when you went to work in Planet Gloves?

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:06.560
It would have been, I would have been seventeen, eighteen.

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:13.560
So, my maths is not very good now.

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:24.560
It would have been about, if I left school, 43, 53.

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:31.560
It would have been about 1960, 59, 60.

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.560
The start of the Beatle era.

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:38.560
Do you remember what the music was like in Sapphire Gardens and the Padgett Runes?

00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:41.560
In those places it was all the big bands.

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:46.560
So it was quite glamorous then?

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:48.560
Oh yes.

00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:51.560
And how did you go? Did you hire a bus?

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:58.560
Yes, one particular person would hire the bus, and we'd all pay our fares,

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:03.560
and it would be there waiting for us to come home.

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:07.560
Which was sometimes quite late, so my mother didn't like this.

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:10.560
She'd be quite annoyed if I got home late.

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:17.560
So, what did you do for clothes then? Did you still make your own clothes?

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:21.560
Yes, always made my own clothes.

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:29.560
Occasionally I'd buy clothes if I had enough money, but no, I mostly made my own clothes.

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:34.560
So, what kind of stuff did you use to wear to go to these dinner dances?

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.560
Oh, you...

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:38.560
Or these big band dances?

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:42.560
Oh yes, if you were going to one of those you'd have something special.

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:45.560
Yes, you would buy something then.

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:51.560
So, were these arranged by the factory or just by one of the workers?

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:54.560
No, ordinary individuals.

00:48:54.560 --> 00:49:01.560
But we did used to have a Christmas dinner dance that the factory would organise.

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:03.560
And where was that put on?

00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:06.560
In the glove factory, it was Bindles in Barry.

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:07.560
Right.

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:14.560
And the bus would be put on, and you would go and buy a special dress then for that,

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.560
because that was a big event.

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:19.560
You'd go down and you'd sit in, you'd have a meal,

00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:23.560
and then there would be a big band afterwards to dance to.

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.560
So, that was a special event.

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:27.560
And that was every Christmas, was it?

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:29.560
Christmas time, yes.

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:33.560
So, how long did you stay at the Planet Gloves?

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:38.560
About two years, and then I went from there then,

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:42.560
because by that time now we were saving to get married,

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:46.560
and I wanted to earn more money.

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:51.560
And things were going down in the glove trade then.

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:58.560
Things were getting sort of not as easy to earn money.

00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:02.560
So, I went from there back to Bridgend Estate,

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:08.560
to a place there where they were making shoes for Marks and Spencer's.

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:11.560
And it was really good money there.

00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:14.560
And I worked there until I got married.

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:19.560
So, I earned quite a lot of money there.

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:23.560
I can remember I was earning quite a good wage there,

00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:27.560
because I was able to save then to get married.

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.560
What was that called?

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:31.560
That was called Fiona Footwear.

00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:35.560
And they made all the shoes and slippers for Marks and Spencer's.

00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:39.560
And what did you do? Was that still sewing?

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:44.560
Still sewing. Still sewing. Sewing the shoes or the slippers.

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:52.560
But they had about, I think at one time, they had three factories on Bridgend Estate,

00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:56.560
and they all made for Marks and Spencer's.

00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:01.560
They only made shoes for Marks and Spencer's, or slippers.

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:06.560
And they would hold a sale at the end of the season.

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:13.560
They'd sell off the old season's shoes, so you could buy the shoes quite cheaply, or the slippers.

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:16.560
Yeah, but they only worked for Marks and Spencer's.

00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:23.560
In fact, Bridgend Estate at that time, most of the manufacturing, the lights manufacturing,

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:27.560
worked for Marks and Spencer's.

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:34.560
There was a factory there making clothes for them, and like I say, shoes and slippers.

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:38.560
The gloves were made for Marks and Spencer's.

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:45.560
So Marks and Spencer's had a lot to answer for when they took all their manufacturing out of this country.

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:49.560
Yes. So Planet Gloves made gloves for Marks and Spencer's?

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.560
Yes, they did.

00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:58.560
So you went to Fiona Footwear, and you said the wages were...was that piecework as well?

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:07.560
Yes, yes. It was a basic wage, but anything you earned over that was added to it.

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:11.560
So you could earn...the harder you worked, the more you could earn.

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:14.560
So do you remember how much you worked there, or how much you earned there?

00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:22.560
No, I can't remember, but I know it was a lot more than what I earned in the glove factory.

00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:32.560
They were one of the top payers on the estate.

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:40.560
Right. And what year did you go there? Was it another...do you remember how long you were in Planet Gloves?

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:47.560
Well, I must have been in the early 20s by then. It must have been the early 20s.

00:52:47.560 --> 00:53:00.560
And I was there until I got married, and I got married when I was 22, 23. Yes, 22, 23. So I was there until I got married.

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:06.560
Right, right. Do you remember what...was that unionised there?

00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:08.560
Oh, yes, that was a union there.

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:10.560
Do you remember which union it was?

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:17.560
No. I think it was something like the Showmakers Union or something like that. But there was a union there, yes.

00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:21.560
Yes. And what were the conditions in the factory like there?

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:30.560
They were quite good. They were quite good. There was a canteen and you could have, you know, you could eat in pleasant surroundings sort of thing.

00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:38.560
But strict again, you know, with timekeeping, and you only got paid if you were in work, and you had to be on time.

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:49.560
You couldn't walk into the factory 10 minutes late from lunch or anything like that. You had to be there on time. And on time in the morning.

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:51.560
Yes. Was that clocking in and coming in?

00:53:51.560 --> 00:54:03.560
Yes, yes. If you didn't clock in on time, they deducted. Like if you were one minute late over the time, you would lose half an hour's money.

00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:07.560
So you made sure that you'd clocked in within a certain time.

00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:08.560
Yes.

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:14.560
I think they allowed you three minutes. But after three minutes you lost a half an hour.

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:19.560
Right. And what time did you start there?

00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:20.560
Half past seven again.

00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:22.560
Right. Same hours of work?

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:29.560
Yes. I think that by the time I started there, I think we finished at half past four.

00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:35.560
I think they'd knocked off half an hour off the working time, the working week.

00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:42.560
Was that something that happened because of legislation, or was it?

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:45.560
Yes, the working week was reduced.

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:46.560
Right.

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:47.560
Yes.

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:49.560
That sounds a bit better, doesn't it?

00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:50.560
Yes.

00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:53.560
And what about the breaks? Were they the same?

00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:56.560
The breaks were the same, yes. Only half an hour for lunch.

00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:57.560
Yes.

00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:00.560
Ten minutes in the morning, half an hour for lunch. No afternoon break.

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:11.560
Because I think, if I remember rightly, when they knocked the half an hour off, or when they reduced the working week, they took off the afternoon break.

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:23.560
Because you were supposed to work so many hours before you have a break, and because we were working less hours, they took off the afternoon break.

00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:26.560
I can't wait, can you?

00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:27.560
No.

00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:32.560
Yeah. So, same holidays then?

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:42.560
Yes, yes. There was no increase in the holidays. Not that I'm aware of anyway, not that I can remember.

00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:48.560
And did your wages stay the same all the time you were there?

00:55:48.560 --> 00:56:03.560
No, they didn't actually. Sometimes it depended on, I can remember them increasing the price, because you had a price for whatever you did.

00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:16.560
For instance, if I was doing slippers, I'd have so much per perhaps dozen, and they would increase the price per dozen.

00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:27.560
I can't remember it happening many times, but I did get increases when I was there. It did increase.

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:31.560
So were you quite happy with the wages there?

00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:40.560
We were never happy. We always wanted more. Yeah, we were never happy. We always wanted more money.

00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:47.560
But you'd apply for it. If you'd refused, well, that was it. You'd accept it.

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:50.560
So were the conditions there, you'd say, were they quite good?

00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:52.560
Yes, yes.

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:55.560
You know, facilities and heat cold.

00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:57.560
Yes, not too bad. Yes.

00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:01.560
And any disputes then, do you remember?

00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:05.560
No, no, I can't remember any disputes there.

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:21.560
No, I can't remember any disputes. The only disputes I can remember was later on, towards the 70s, when I worked part-time after I was married.

00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:25.560
Where did you work then?

00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:38.560
Well, once I got married and I had my first child, he was around about two, and we'd already bought our own house then, which was unusual at that time.

00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:43.560
And it was an old house, and it needed an awful lot to go into it.

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:51.560
So I'd applied for an evening job in the local wella factory, making hair cosmetics.

00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:52.560
Right.

00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:59.560
And you worked from, I think it was five o'clock until ten o'clock.

00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:14.560
So my husband would come home from work, I'd have all the tea ready, and he would look after my son and put him to bed and everything, while I went to work.

00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:20.560
So I worked from five o'clock until ten o'clock, and that was five evenings a week.

00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:30.560
In the hair cosmetics, which I enjoyed. I think there was about 50 of us working on the production lines.

00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:32.560
What did you enjoy about that then?

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:41.560
Well, I quite enjoyed it because you were sort of going out in the evening, and you were all in the same position.

00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:47.560
They were all young married women. Most of us had children. There was very few without children.

00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:55.560
It was mostly all people with children, because we couldn't work in the day because there was no childcare facilities.

00:58:55.560 --> 00:59:04.560
There was absolutely no childcare facilities then. No nurseries, nothing. Your child didn't go to school until they were four.

00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:11.560
So the only way you could work was to work in unsociable hours.

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:22.560
And there were many, many of the manufacturers who used to do the evening shift, what they would call the evening shifts, and social hours.

00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:36.560
Wellers was the nearest one, but there were also people like AB Electronics where they used to weld circuit boards and things like that. They always did an evening shift.

00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:40.560
Do you think they did those shifts to suit people like you?

00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:41.560
Yes, very much so.

00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:42.560
Because they were aware.

00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:58.560
Well, they did it because they needed the extra production, and they knew that they could develop on production by using it right from the day shift in the day right through until 10 o'clock in the evening.

00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:02.560
And they knew there was a whole workforce out there of women, I suppose.

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:06.560
Yes, there was never any problem to recruit for the evenings.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:12.560
Did you, do you think you liked going there for a bit of adult conversation after being with them?

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.560
Oh, I did, very much so. I mean, money was the first priority.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:22.560
But yes, the adult conversation, and because we were all, we had a lot in common.

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:33.560
And then we had a wonderful social life because we all organised things like we'd go on a day trip to Tenby, and we'd all go on the coach with the children and take the children.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:41.560
And I've got photographs now of us all sitting on the beach, you know, in a circle on the beach with all the children.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:51.560
We used to go out to dances and dinner dances. Yeah, it was really, really a good social life with that job.

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:57.560
Was it mainly, you know, you went on trips like that, was it mainly women and children or did your husbands go as well?

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:00.560
Only in the day if we went to the seaside or anything.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:01.560
Yes.

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:04.560
But no, if we went to the dinner dances, husbands would come along as well.

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.560
Yes, no, but I mean the day trips like that.

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:08.560
The day trips, it was mostly women.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:09.560
Yes.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.560
Yes, women and children.

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:13.560
Did you make new friends in London?

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.560
Yes, yes, yes, I did.

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:20.560
People you didn't know, were there people there you knew when you got there?

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:26.560
There were one or two people that I did know, yes, from around the locality.

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:32.560
But I got to know a lot of different people there, but they were excellent employers.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:33.560
Oh, were they?

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:35.560
Yes, yes, they were.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.560
Better than the road trade employers?

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.560
Oh, much, much better, yes.

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.560
Why do you think that was?

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:48.560
They just were, they were much more interested in the welfare of the workers.

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:52.560
It was a German company actually.

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:54.560
We always had a Christmas present.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:55.560
Right.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:58.560
If it was a Christmas, it would be a nice Christmas present.

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:03.560
I can think of different social events, you know, that were organised through the company.

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:06.560
No, they were excellent employers.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.560
What kind of social events did they organise?

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:13.560
There was always a Christmas lunch, always Christmas parties.

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:20.560
And I can remember one particular time, a Formula, now I think it was a Formula One racing car.

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:30.560
It must have been a promotion for the company, and they brought the Formula One car to the company, in the company grounds.

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:36.560
And we all met the driver and we all had to sit in this Formula One car.

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:40.560
So I'm assuming that it was an advertising car for the company.

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:42.560
Was it somebody famous, did it?

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.560
Yes, I think it was somebody famous.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:49.560
I can't remember now because I wasn't too interested in racing drag cars.

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.560
But no, they were an excellent company to work for.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.560
Yes.

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:55.560
What about the work itself?

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.560
Was it dangerous, you know, working with chemicals?

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.560
Yes, yes, it could have been.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:06.560
Were you aware of anybody with any health issues or that kind of thing?

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.560
Not at the time, it's only since.

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:21.560
It's only since, because now I mean, I can remember the vats of hair products coming out of the labs to go on to the production line.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:32.560
And when you started the shift, the work shift, because I was a supervisor on there, or the line leader they called it then,

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:40.560
you would check the product, so you'd lift the lid on the vat of the product and you'd smell it and you'd look in it.

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:46.560
And I think of it now and I'm thinking of all those chemicals that I've inhaled.

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:47.560
Yes.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:55.560
And one particular line was glass bottles going through the line, you know, to be filled.

01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:01.560
Like they would go on to a turntable and go through and be filled and capped and then on and labelled.

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:11.560
But if the machine wasn't set up properly or if there was a problem with the machine, the glass bottles would break, you know.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:15.560
So it could have been quite dangerous.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:22.560
The machines were quite, they could have been quite dangerous.

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:32.560
But in all fairness I have to say that the company were well aware of health and safety at that time.

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:37.560
It wouldn't have been called health and safety, but they were aware of the safety of the workers.

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:38.560
Right.

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:40.560
Like if you were filling anything.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:41.560
So there was protection.

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:42.560
Yes.

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:48.560
They would make sure you wore goggles if you were filling something that wasn't.

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:49.560
Yes, they were.

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:50.560
Yes.

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:59.560
I think maybe that was the start of companies being more aware of the health in manufacturing of their workers.

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:00.560
Yes.

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:06.560
Were you aware of anybody with health issues from there afterwards or, you know?

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:07.560
No.

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:10.560
I mean you said you thought of yourself.

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.560
Yes, yes.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:12.560
No, I don't think so.

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:16.560
Were there any disputes when you were there? Union disputes, that kind of thing?

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:19.560
Oh yes, there was a strong union there.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.560
There was a strong union there.

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:24.560
So the union would put forward for a pay rise.

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:25.560
Yes.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:33.560
And that would go through, you know, and if they didn't agree to the pay rise or then they would go on strike.

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:35.560
They would walk out.

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:40.560
And I can remember them picketing outside the factory.

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:47.560
Because we were evening workers, we were sort of on the fringe of the workforce, you know?

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:48.560
Yes.

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:50.560
Were you members of the union?

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:58.560
Oh yes, we had to be members of the union because there was great competition between the day workers and the evening workers.

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:19.560
Because apparently, because we only worked sort of five till ten, we could, the productivity from that small evening shift was much better than what a day worker would produce.

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:22.560
Because obviously you only worked a few hours.

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:26.560
So there was great competition between the day and the evening workers.

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:29.560
They didn't particularly like the evening workers.

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:32.560
Were you aware of sort of time and motion people?

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.560
Oh yes, yes.

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.560
In all the factories you worked?

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:46.560
Yes, yes. That was how your, the price for your item would be by time and you.

01:06:46.560 --> 01:07:03.560
Particularly in the footwear trade, if a new style of shoe came out, it would be a time and motion person would stand by the side of you while you were doing, you were part of the job and they would time you.

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:13.560
And the time you took to do that piece of work would give you the price for the job.

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:17.560
Right, so the price for retail then?

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:23.560
No, the price that I would be paid for doing my part on the show.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:27.560
Particularly in the shoe trade. There was always time and motion.

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:33.560
Every new style of shoe would be timed.

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:41.560
Anyway, you were talking about the Christmas parties. Were these for you and the kids?

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:46.560
Yes, there was a Christmas party for the other children but there was also a Christmas party for just the workers.

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:49.560
Right, so one in the day, one in the evening.

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:51.560
Yes, yes.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:54.560
So would you say that was one of the best places you worked?

01:07:54.560 --> 01:08:00.560
Yes, one of the best companies, yes. In manufacturing, definitely.

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:04.560
Although it was hard in a way because you worked at night.

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:09.560
Yes, yes. But they were an excellent company to work for.

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:11.560
Was that because they were German, do you think?

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:14.560
I don't know, I wonder if it was.

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:17.560
Or perhaps maybe times had moved on.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:21.560
It could have been that times had moved on.

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:31.560
However, from there I had the best job of all because after my children had started to grow up,

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:45.560
I went back to evening classes and I did an English all-ever and then I saw a job advertised in the University of Glamorgan.

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:53.560
But it was through my sewing experience that I got the job first. It was for a seamstress in the halls of residence.

01:08:54.560 --> 01:09:04.560
I thought to myself, I think I'll try for that. I'd been out of work now for about two years because my, no, I hadn't been out of work for two years.

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:13.560
I had been working but the evening work was drying up and I didn't really want to do evenings now because my children were getting older.

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:22.560
So I saw this job advertised and I thought, I'll apply for it. So I went and I had an interview and I got the job.

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:40.560
So I started out doing the laundry for the halls of residence because at that time there was actually maids working in the halls of residence who cleaned the rooms, made the beds, changed the beds, everything like that.

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:50.560
So I was in charge of all the laundry and different things like that. But from there I had a managed rest.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:10:02.560
The managed rest was a young person who really encouraged me and she said to me, why don't you go to college and do City and Gills?

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:09.560
Because they knew they were building new halls of residence. So I said, yes, all right then.

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:15.560
So I went to Newport College and did a City and Gills because I already was doing an old ever.

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:27.560
And from there I never looked back because I started out in as the seamstress but then she promoted me and I had a manager's job in the halls of residence.

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:32.560
And I worked there until I retired and I absolutely loved it.

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.560
So how long was that for?

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.560
I worked there for about 15 years then.

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:37.560
Wow.

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:43.560
Yeah. But oh, best job I ever had. I loved it. Working with the students.

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:44.560
Yes, yes.

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:48.560
Looking after all the cleaning side of it and the maintenance side of it.

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:49.560
Yes.

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:53.560
Yes, I really enjoyed that. And of course they built new halls of residence.

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:54.560
Yes.

01:10:54.560 --> 01:11:00.560
I was on the campus so it became a huge, at one time there was about 1200 rooms there then.

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:02.560
Right, right.

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.560
And that was my whole career.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:16.560
I was going to ask you, actually when you were at Weller, did you miss doing the kind of skilled work that you've been doing, you know sewing?

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.560
No.

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:18.560
You didn't?

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:19.560
No, I didn't.

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:22.560
Was it because you've done so much of it?

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:23.560
Probably.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:36.560
Yes, probably. No, I didn't miss it at all. Because when I worked in Weller, because I was the line leader, I more or less organised all the line.

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:39.560
You know, and organised the workload.

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.560
Yes, so there was a different skill then.

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:42.560
Yes, yes.

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:48.560
Yes, it was more of a kind of, organising and manager skill, yeah.

01:11:48.560 --> 01:12:01.560
Okay, well I was going to ask you, just one last thing. Looking back now then, oh no, before I ask you that, are you in contact with any of your former workmates?

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:04.560
Yes, yes, I still keep in touch with them.

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.560
From all the places of work?

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:16.560
Yes, because this one here I'm still in touch with, we've been friends since we started school together.

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.560
And what's her name?

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:19.560
Her name is Joan.

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:20.560
Joan, yeah.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:36.560
And Joan and I started school at five and we still meet up on a Saturday, perhaps once a month and go out and have lunch and so we're still in contact. So we've been friends now for 70 years.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:37.560
Yes.

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:49.560
And that one is not alive anymore. But these I still keep in touch with because I'm in the U3A, the University of the Third Age.

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:50.560
Oh right, yes.

01:12:50.560 --> 01:13:04.560
And I started, I was a founder member of the University of the Third Age in Tonrever. And the craft class that we go to now, I meet this person here, through the University of the Third Age.

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.560
Yes, the one with the needles.

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:07.560
Yes.

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:08.560
And what's her name?

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:24.560
Myr her name is. So I'm in touch with her. And then the weller, evening, the evening shift, I'm in touch with the person, she goes to the craft class there.

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:39.560
And we meet up occasionally. We go to leaks and have coffee and yeah, so I'm in touch with all of them and the university one. I'm still in touch with the people from the university. Yeah.

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:49.560
Great. And looking back, how do you feel about the time you've spent working in factories now?

01:13:49.560 --> 01:14:00.560
To be honest, when I look back on my working life, I just wish that I'd had an education. I always wished I'd had an education.

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:09.560
And when I worked in the university, I used to envy those students. Not particularly because it was a university, but because of all the knowledge that they had.

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:17.560
You know, when they had so many opportunities and I used to think, oh, what I would have given to have gone to university would have been wonderful.

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:29.560
And that's why I made sure that my own two children went to university. And I always used to say to them, you know, you must have an education because the world is your oyster.

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:40.560
If you've got an education, you can do anything you want to do in this world. I always say that to my children. It was my biggest regret that I didn't have an education. Yeah.
