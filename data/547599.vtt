00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.000
O thou the home of goodness host, I give my heart to thee.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:33.000
In all my sorrows come place closed, But not remember me.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Lay on my aimless heart, My sins I never leave,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:07.000
My heart and soul will wish impart, With love remember me.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The world of thee.
