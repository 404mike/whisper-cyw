00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.640
In July 1939, a young Renata Collins from Czechoslovakia arrives at the home of her

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.920
new foster parents in Porth, South Wales.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:36.000
And when I came to Porth, my foster mum, she took my plaits out, washed my hair and found I had ringlets.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.160
Of course ringlets I had to have after that.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.600
And when she held me on a lap, I wondered what she was doing.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.080
Mum was quite loving because she looked after everybody in the church.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.080
You know, if they were ill, she'd go and see them.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.320
And so I had a first Welsh kutch.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:01.680
First September 1939, Germany invades Poland.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:10.000
At the same time, a group of German Jewish children travel from London to Abergalla in North Wales

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.400
to begin training for their new lives as agricultural workers.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.040
Hermann Rothman is among them.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.040
On the day war broke out, I was actually on my way to Guchhase.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:31.040
Children of my age did not understand the full impact of war.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.040
It's an experience which you learn then very much the hardware.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:43.040
For most of us, we thought in any case it's not going to last very long, two or three months,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.040
and then there will be peace and everything will be back to normal.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.040
The start of the Second World War changed the landscape of Europe for Jewish refugees.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.040
Escape to Britain became much more difficult, and as the war progressed,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.040
those who had managed to find sanctuary came under suspicion as enemy aliens.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.040
Added to this, a slow drip of information coming from friends and relatives on the continent

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.040
hinted at the horrors to come.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.040
I'm Maurice Brodie, historian at Aberystwyth University.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:27.040
In this third episode of the Holocaust in Wales, we look at how refugees adapted to their new lives in Wales.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.040
How did the local community welcome them?

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.040
What challenges and opportunities did they face?

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.040
And how did their status change as the war progressed?

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.040
Adjusting to life in a different country after fleeing their homes and support networks

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.040
was a traumatic experience for many refugees.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.040
The change required was quick, often too quick.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.040
Des Goulton from Slovakia remembers his mother's difficulties after arriving in Cardiff.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:09.040
Well, you see, I remember when we came, and my mother was very, very upset.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:17.040
And she was crying all the time because she felt that she is not a different country.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.040
She doesn't speak the language. She doesn't know anybody.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.040
And she felt very left on her own.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.040
Many continental refugees were from well-to-do, middle or upper class backgrounds

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.040
and unused to the more rural life found in Wales.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.040
Gabby Cople's parents were from Germany and Hungary.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.040
Between my parents, I think one got a sense of Cardiff being a little bit of a backwater.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.040
You know, obviously they'd lived in major European capital cities.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.040
In my dad's case, Berlin and Prague. In my mother's case, Budapest and Paris.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.040
My mother definitely felt, you know, it was a little bit Hicksville.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.040
And she had lots of stories about that kind of thing.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.040
Where she said she went into a wine shop and asked for a rosé.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.040
And they like didn't, it was a wine specialist. They'd never heard of it.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.040
They didn't know what a rosé was.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.040
And that seemed to encapsulate, you know, what Wales was like.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:23.040
Leah Lesser came on the Kindertransport and stayed with a guardian in Bull Bay on Unus Mon, Anglesey.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.040
There's a white bungalow on top of a hill.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.040
And you approached it along a lane with two gates and then you went up two fields.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:41.040
And when I lived there, originally in 39, we had no running water, no gas, no electricity.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.040
We cooked on pyrophene and we carried water from the well.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.040
And if it rained, we were lucky enough to have water in the tanks.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.040
Despite these obstacles, many refugees found a warm welcome in Wales.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.040
Fanny Höchstetter and Anton Hünsdorfer were both refugees from Germany,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.040
but met after moving to Llangollen, where they married and started a family.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.040
Here's Ernie Hunter, their son.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.040
They always felt the Welsh people were warm and welcoming.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.040
So for example, when my brother was born,

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.040
neither my father nor my mother earned particularly much or hadn't particularly much.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.040
They didn't own a property. They were rented accommodation.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:32.040
The Welsh ladies went around lending my mother all sorts of things for the newborn child.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.040
So she was lent a pram.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:41.040
Apparently, one of these big nanny type prams you see on television, et cetera, which my parents could never ever afford.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.040
It wasn't given to her in the sense of keep it forever, but I'm not going to use it.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.040
You have it.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:52.040
Some refugees managed to forge a connection to Wales before relocating.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:59.040
Kate Bossie Griffiths came to Britain as a refugee from Wittenberg in Germany in 1937.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:05.040
An Egyptologist, she eventually got a job at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford,

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.040
where she met her future husband, the Welshman Gwyn Griffiths.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.040
They moved to the Rhondda in 1939.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:19.040
Hynie Griffiths, Kate's son, thinks this helped her to assimilate into Welsh society.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:26.040
And having met my father, married swiftly because of the war,

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:33.040
and came to the Rhondda when she was part of a very close-knit family.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:43.040
So in a way she had a safety net in a Welsh family and Welsh culture,

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.040
which I imagine other refugees wouldn't normally have.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.040
To many locals, refugees from Europe were a real curiosity.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.040
Herman Rothman, who lived in a Jewish children's colony at Gwrach Castle,

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.040
remembers being quizzed by a group of Welsh farm workers after arriving from Germany.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:10.040
To avoid any unnecessary tension, he told them he was Polish, where his father was from.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.040
They heard I could speak English, and what a wonderful moment that was.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.040
We were in a big shed. He called everybody in.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:25.040
They sat in a circle, and I, they said, look on, sit in the middle of it.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.040
And they fired questions at me with their Welsh accent.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.040
First of all, I thought, that is very, very strange.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:38.040
I was taught English, they pronounce it all completely different.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.040
They must have taught me the wrong English.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:46.040
So they said, have they got a cow in Poland?

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.040
So I answered, yes.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.040
Have they got horses in Poland?

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.040
I answered in the affirmative.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.040
I thought the questions were very elementary.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:05.040
I thought, well, I didn't think that life, I thought perhaps life in Wales was elementary.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:14.040
I felt very flattered by being the centre of an attraction in this cow shed or whatever it was.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:22.040
Renata Collins left such an impression on locals in Porf that she started a new baby name trend.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.040
And of course, I was a seven day wonder, wasn't I?

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:30.040
This child that had come from a country they'd never heard of.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:37.040
And eventually I had three Renatas there, the church members, their grandchildren.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.040
What a lovely name. And I'd love to know where they are now.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:47.040
Child refugees needed to adapt not only to a new school, but a new language,

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.040
or two if they found themselves in a Welsh speaking area.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:56.040
For Renata, being plunged into a new culture may have led her to forget her own.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:02.040
Well, the first year I went to the senior school, you had to do Welsh.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:09.040
And of course, mum Coppastone was from Fishguard, she was Welsh, spoken anyway.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.040
She preached in Welsh.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.040
Then the first year after Welsh, they put me in the German class.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.040
Do you know I was bottom? I literally was bottom.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.040
And you know, I'm certain that was psychological.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:28.040
I wanted to obliterate my past, not intentionally.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:35.040
Once the war started, some children were targeted for their German or Austrian heritage.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.040
George Sherman came to Wales after his father moved his business from Vienna

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.040
to Trafora's trading estate near Pontypridd.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.040
George attended school in Cardiff.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.040
And I was teased.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.040
You know, they would call me names.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.040
Gerry was the favourite one.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:10:00.040
They would run around pretending to be aeroplanes, as little children did in those days,

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.040
with arms outstretched, making noises.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.040
And I was always the Messerschmitt, which got shot at.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.040
Anyway, it was, it wasn't very pleasant.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.040
The fact that I couldn't speak a word of English, of course,

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.040
and no effort was really made to include me in the lessons.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:27.040
So every day at break time at 10 o'clock, I sneaked out through the gate and ran home.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:35.040
During the war, the Czechoslovak government in exile set up a school for Czechoslovak children in Britain,

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.040
initially located in Shropshire.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:46.040
In 1943, the school was relocated to the village of Llanurthed Wells in Poes.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:53.040
Around 140 students were taught at the school, including Jewish refugee Milena Grenfell-Bames,

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:58.040
who grew up in Prosec, about 150 kilometres to the east of Prague.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:05.040
It was very interesting because when we came here, this, it wasn't a town at the time,

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:10.040
and they had hardly seen any English, never mind a whole troop of Czech children.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.040
And so we decided to give them a concert and sang for them.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.040
Everything sang in Czech, but at the end we sang My Home Learned When Hard I.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.040
And I think from that day, the town adopted us.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:28.040
Leah Lesser also attended the Czechoslovak State School, having initially been schooled at Amluch.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:34.040
The class I remember best of all is the third class,

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:41.040
and it used to be a hut. It used to have a big stove in the middle.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:51.040
And for our leavenses, we used to have sliced bread and put it against the side of the stove and the top.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:57.040
And we used to have lovely burnt toast, and we used to look forward to that every morning.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:02.040
But we had a lovely time because everybody was lovely.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:07.040
One of the hubs for adult refugees in South Wales was Triforce Trading Estate,

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:12.040
which hosted a number of factories started by refugee industrialists.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:17.040
Des Goulton remembers how refugees transformed the area in the late 1930s.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:31.040
In 1939 and beginning 1940, there was hardly any English spoken on the Triforce Estate.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:37.040
The language spoken was either Czech or German or Hungarian.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:48.040
And at the top of the war, there must have been easily 15,000 people working on the estate.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.040
George Schoenman's family ran a box and cigarette paper company from Triforce.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:13:01.040
They made boxes, well, I don't know, you could put shoes in them, all that sort of thing.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:06.040
Although, of course, they didn't do so well in the war because on the one hand,

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:10.040
there was very little new stuff being produced.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:15.040
And the one thing that you didn't need was luxury boxes.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:21.040
So they did struggle a bit. And the main revenue stream was from the cigarette paper.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.040
The estate was packed with refugee firms.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.040
General Paper and Box.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:34.040
Metal Products Brackets, Triforce Brackets Limited.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.040
Planet Gloves.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.040
Aerozip Fasters.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.040
Opie Chocolate.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.040
Burlington Gloves and Burlington Fabrics.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.040
Wine Brothers.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.040
Stuart Singham.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:57.040
Triforce was an important employer in South Wales and one that fellow refugees could benefit from.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:02.040
Refugees elsewhere often faced unfamiliar employment prospects.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:06.040
Fanny Huchstetter was originally a civil servant in Stuttgart,

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:11.040
but in Wales she worked as a chambermaid at the Hand Hotel in Llangollen.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.040
Her son, Ernie Hunter, describes how she dealt with it.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:21.040
She buckled down to it, it's as simple as that, and from what I gather did whatever was needed,

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:25.040
even though she was most certainly not used to it.

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.040
So how efficient she was, I do not know,

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:34.040
because she was certainly not used to that sort of work, doing it at all.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:39.040
Some refugees fully immersed themselves in Welsh cultural life.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:47.040
Kate Bossagryffeths learnt the language and even published novels, short stories and non-fiction books in Welsh.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:52.040
She never lost her German accent though, as Hiany Gryffith, her son, remembers.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:15:04.040
Oh yes, I mean, Welsh to outsiders would be difficult to understand because of the accent until they tuned into it.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.040
The o would always be pronounced as oof.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:17.040
So wedi is a word that comes up often, I've gone rewediment, or vediment, that kind of thing.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.040
Forget that, she didn't lose her German accent.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.040
Events on the continent, however, were never far away.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:38.040
From the beginning of the war, all adult Germans and Austrians living in Britain were classified as so-called enemy aliens.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:45.040
Some were jailed, but initially most were permitted to live freely, albeit with certain restrictions.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:51.040
George Sherman explains how refugees at Driforest coped with the government-mandated curfew.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:57.040
And you had to be in your house by seven o'clock and you were not allowed out after seven.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:03.040
So a lot of my friends were Czech, and of course they weren't subject to the curfew,

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.040
because the Czechs were allies and the Austrians weren't.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:16.040
So mostly the visitors came to my parents because they were free to walk around in the evening and my parents weren't.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.040
So this went on, there was a different night.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:25.040
It worked like a railway timetable. If it was Tuesday, you knew the millers were coming.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:31.040
If it was Wednesday, it was the tophlers. If it was Thursday, it was the court's funds.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:37.040
If it was Friday, it was another family. And this went on week after week.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:46.040
In May 1940, the German occupation of the Low Countries and France panicked the British government

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:50.040
and prompted the mass internment of German and Austrian citizens.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:17:00.040
By June, 28,000 aliens, most of whom were Jewish refugees, were arrested and sent to various camps across the country,

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.040
the largest of which was on the Isle of Man.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:11.040
Gabby Copple's father, Henry Copple, was one of the youngest to be interned and was subsequently deported to Canada.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.040
He tried to make the best of it.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.040
He was sent to Highton in Liverpool, which was a holding camp.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:23.040
Then he was sent to the Isle of Man. And he did tell all these stories about how the Isle of Man, it was like a university to him.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:27.040
He learned such a lot about music, the Amadeus Quartet. He heard them play.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:31.040
He learned to play bridge, which was his lifelong passion.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:37.040
My dad did always tend to look at the bright side, I'd say. And he was a pragmatist.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:42.040
I think it was a bit of an adventure for him. He saw the world. He went to Canada.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:47.040
The food, the rationals were absolutely rubbish in Canada.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:55.040
But you had all these Vietnamese pastry chefs and they'd take all the rations and all this awful meat, quality meat that was being sent.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.040
Make it into salami and sell it back to the Canadians at a profit.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:06.040
Internies were eventually released, but the war affected refugees in other ways too.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:10.040
Des Golden was in Cardiff when it was bombed by the German Luftwaffe.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:18.040
I remember Cardiff being raided by the German air force.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:26.040
And I remember we were living in Heathwood Road on top so we can overlook Cardiff.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:32.040
And I remember an aeroplane. I didn't see the plane because it was at night.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:38.040
But I remember the explosion and the aeroplane being shot down.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:44.040
Refugees received war news either by letters from family members or through the Red Cross.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:53.040
Herman Rothman remembers receiving news that, back in Germany, his father had been arrested and sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:19:03.040
I took this letter into the lavatory, the bathroom, and for the first time I burst out crying.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:11.040
Because I always kept myself as manly as possible without showing my emotions.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.040
I went to the toilet. I remember this very, very well.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:18.040
Because I knew that is the end for my father.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:23.040
From time to time my mother said he's all right. She heard in concentration camp she's all right.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:32.040
In May of 1940 I received a letter which was the best letter ever.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:44.040
She said he has been released from concentration camp in Sachsenhausen and he is immediately going to Palestine illegally.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:52.040
Well, as you would say, I celebrated Christmas. But I didn't in a Jewish way on a May day.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:58.040
Few letters from Europe had such happy endings.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:05.040
The last communication Renata Collins received from her parents was in June 1942 for her birthday.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.040
That's the last communication I had from my mother.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:16.040
That was the 10th of the 6th, 1942 via the Red Cross.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:23.040
But it didn't say where she was. It said where it was going to, which is 8 Venus Street in Porth.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:27.040
Many happy birthday wishes we think continually of you.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:35.040
Our well hope you too. Much love, kind regards and thanks to your foster parents.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:45.040
Now they were supposed to be able to be replied but when Coppastone tried to they said no there's no reply.

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.040
So that's the last communication.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:55.040
Both Renata's parents and 62 other members of her family were murdered in the Holocaust.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:02.040
By the end of 1944 it was clear that Germany and its allies would lose the war.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:07.040
What was less clear, at least to many, was the scale of industrialised murder

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:13.040
perpetrated against the Jews of Europe by the Nazis and their collaborators.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:20.040
In the next episode we hear the stories of those refugees who took up arms against their former homeland.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:27.040
As well as those Welsh people who bore witness to the horrors of the Nazi camps at the moment of liberation.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:32.040
Until next time, thanks for listening.
