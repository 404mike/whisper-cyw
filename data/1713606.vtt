WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
This is risk, this pandemic is risk. When the war was, because at least we could leave the house,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:14.080
we could go out and move on rations and everything. You know, two ounces of butter for a week or

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:21.440
half a pound of sugar. Oh yeah. And you could see it coming when there was war. It was different.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:28.160
You knew all the noise. The pandemic is just silent. It's horrible. Oh yes, yes, that's true.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:39.920
It's um, oh yeah, it was um, I'm living there. But then, then at 20 I got married. Yeah. And I was

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.160
living just where I'm almost living now. I'm, now I'm in Christina Street. I was living in the next

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.280
street, Angelina Street, when I was 20. Just after I got married, I was lucky enough, well not

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.720
lucky enough. A friend of mine who had gone to school with and been real friends with, she died young.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.280
She was my brother's age, just right, about 22, 23. She died and I had this house that she had lived in.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.280
And I lived there, 20 years old. I lived there and then my life went on from there.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:22.560
Yeah, so what about that thing about then getting married and family and stuff like that, Laura?

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:32.640
I only had one son. Yeah. Only had one son. And as a matter of fact, I've ended up with like,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:43.120
don't know how many. So, as a matter of fact, there's a thing out. Oh, I was, it was my birthday on

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.960
on Sunday. Go on, I've got to ask you, how old were you on Sunday? I was 93.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.880
You'd never believe it talking to you. Trust me, you'd never believe it. Well, as a matter of fact,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:06.640
I know I'm a great, great, great, great grandmother. And I get annoyed because I've got

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.040
one granddaughter that is Facebook mad. Right. She can't put the phone down until it ends.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.840
And every year they do give me a party for children, you know, and we generally go like

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.720
to a Chinese restaurant or somewhere where we all go, you know, have a big party of our

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.360
names. But I haven't done that for the last two years because I can't stand all that nonsense.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.400
But apparently they got me because I've had some of my friends who sent me a card. I had, I took

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.560
the cards down. I had 27 cards and I still have, I still have four more since I took them down.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.000
Yeah. Oh, well, I should imagine there's a lot of people that do know me. And of course,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.440
I was a bingo fan. My bingo's closed down, you know, not since I was going to bingo,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.720
you know, even this year, last year, you know, till it was locked down and whatever.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:13.680
So I'm well known in a few places. And I'm the last left of my class in school. I can name every

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.240
one of my friends I went to school with. Some of them went years and years ago. The last one went

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.640
last year, a boy that lives by me, me and him. Well, we always used to laugh together

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.360
because both of our birthdays were in February. And he passed through, I should say, Christ

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.880
read, just anyway, you left. Another one went just before him, a Spanish boy that lived down in West

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:49.280
Close. There was only three left from my class. And now there's only me, all the boys and all the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.800
girls are gone. There are a few a bit older than me, but it wasn't like either going to my school,

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.440
going to St. Mary's or some other or brought up in Ely, you know. I can name about two or three.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.520
They're just a bit older, about my age. And of course, one in Ely, one in Fairwater.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.320
I think I got friends, a friend, a great friend of mine, she's here every week. She's 88.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.440
You wouldn't think it, you know, to fear. And, well, there's a few of us knocking on, but I

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.600
don't think there's any at the moment who can name as old as me. Oh my goodness.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.320
My mum always used to say, you're as old as you allow yourself to be.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:47.680
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, I try to keep your grey matter going. My legs are letting me down at the

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.280
moment. And I'm trying all things. As a matter of fact, my ex daughter-in-law, she brought me

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.840
an exercise pedal. Right. That's what she brought on Saturday for me.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.880
And I've already got that resistive one, you put your feet on. I've got a massage chair

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.440
and none of them seems to be doing my legs much good. But none of it's hurting your mind,

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:20.080
I can tell that. I still get open about it. If I've got my trolley with me, I still get open about.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:27.360
But I haven't been out since I was in for the six months, you know, the first lockdown we had.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:37.040
And Chris the Kid says, no, mum, be careful, blah, blah, blah. Yeah. I went out twice, I went out

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:43.200
twice that week. And that was the first time since this last lockdown. Oh, I know. And little do

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.960
they know we got more stamina than them. That's right. You've been making for Darwin, aren't you?

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.360
Yeah, Darwin's my uncle. Gwen was my auntie. I can picture Gwen, I can picture her husband as well.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:02.560
I can see me as the relative of me. Yeah. I worked with them. Darwin worked in a colonial centre.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.000
Yes, that's right. Yeah. Well, that's where I worked. That's why I was so well known,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:16.560
because I worked there when I was 18. That was when I had my son. And that was the first job I

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.840
had after I had my son. The colonial centre, the colonial centre was really important.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:30.160
And that's how I knew a lot of the men, you know, because the store-wings used to come there,

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:36.880
when they were brought up the shifts, they'd have a room at the colonial centre. And I used to serve

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.440
them, you know, I had the shift that I used to do breakfast, and then the shift I used to do that

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:50.800
evening meal. Yeah. I think, I'm not sure, I don't think Darwin, I don't think Darwin

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:57.120
worked in the office there when I was working there. I know he worked there when Mr Pencil,

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:05.680
this guy Mr Pencil, was the boss, you know, the manager of the club. And Mr Abel from Barre,

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:12.240
he worked there. Yeah, yeah. Did you know anything about the Abel family? Oh, yeah,

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:19.760
God, yeah, Barre families, we know more. I mean, you know, it's, you know. Henry and the two boys,

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:28.880
Henry and, oh, Freddie, yeah, Freddie Abel. Yeah, Freddie Abel, yeah. Yeah. I also knew another

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:35.520
family, with the two boys, always worked in the grocery shops, the cut food. Yep. You know, yeah,

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:44.240
Charlie and, oh, they were great boys, and they worked in the grocery shop in Louisa Street,

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.840
and then they came on, they came and they worked in a shop in Duke Street. And, oh, they were part

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:58.400
of the, part of the box then, two boys. I remember I went to a party down in Barre one night, me and

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:06.000
my husband were invited, and one of the chapters was there. Yeah. I don't know if it was Charlie or,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.240
or, oh, I used to go to the Casa Blanca. It was a church originally. Yeah. That's what you're talking

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:18.720
about. Yep. In Mount St. Louis Square. Mount St. Louis Square is originally a church, and the chapter

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:26.080
was run by the owner, a very shy, very an Arab man. Yeah, but there was a few clubs at the time,

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:34.880
Silver Clark had one in, at the bottom of the dock, at the pier, that was, oh, I forget the name of it.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.720
And there's another one, you had the North Star in James Street.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.280
Then there's another one on the other side of James Street, because my husband

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:55.200
was a doorman there. Oh, there's a few clubs, oh, the Casa Blanca, yeah, we always used to get there

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:03.680
on the trade, you know, Saturday. Great music, great music. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, it's a small

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:10.480
world, isn't it? It is, isn't it? I mean, that's the thing, that's the thing. Yeah, what better use

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:15.920
the Casa Blanca? I mean, I was speaking, I was speaking to someone not long ago who lives up the

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:25.280
valleys, up in Pont Neprethe, and he used to say, once a month, he used to go to Cardiff,

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:32.960
and he'd go to, he'd go to the Casa Blanca. Oh, yeah. Because people, it's an old white guy,

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:41.760
people would say to him, oh, you went down there. You know, and he said to me, he said,

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:48.000
I've never been more welcomed, and when I walked in after, I hadn't been there for a month,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.800
people go, well, you've been. You know, and he said, friendly, never believe just how friendly

00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:04.960
people were, as long as you treated them as you wanted them to treat you. That's always been my

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:10.800
motto, treat people as you would like to be treated yourself. And funny thing, like even when

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:19.280
I was young, most weekends, you get a lot from the valleys coming down, especially like on match

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.960
nights, you'd end up with the same cat where you was having, you know, you'd come from your club and

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:31.600
go for a supper with salmon, yams, or any of them Indian restaurants, and a lot of people from the

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:37.040
valleys, the men used to come down, you know, on a Saturday, a Friday, Saturday,

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:43.120
yeah, you'd get a lot of the valley people. Well, I think on Wednesday or certain days,

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.960
the mothers used to come shopping, you know, demand expenses and all them places.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:56.080
A lot of Welsh girls, valleys, you know, duff boys and people from Cargis. Yeah.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:03.520
Well, as a matter of fact, one time, it was when I was pregnant and I had a few friends

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:12.400
I used to go up to Mount Kinash occasionally on a Sunday because I had friends there.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:19.120
And well, I think his, I think his, you know, both names was Pendlecuyber.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:19.920
Pendlecuyber, yeah.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:27.360
They had some friends there and a few times I went up there, Mount Kinash,

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:33.600
and we stayed friends for years, for years, only like, it's only about,

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:38.640
I don't just been alive for about 20 years, but other than that, I was in touch with them,

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:48.240
always send a Christmas card to Davises because one of them had a mixed race baby.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.680
Yeah.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.160
You know, there's a few, I think, up there, valleys there, like that, Iris Williams, a singer.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.160
Yeah, well, that's it.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.160
And what about you? Are you like mixed race looking?

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:09.200
My family now, I got great faith and believe my grandson, he could always pass his rights, you know.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.160
Yeah, you can't tell the difference. My kids, my grandkids.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.200
Well, there's a few in my family now, you know, blue eyed.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:18.420
Yeah.

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:22.880
Some of that blonde hair, they're gone dark now, but I got a few that got blue eyes.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.120
Never believe it. Oh, Hitler must be turning in his bloody grave.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:32.560
Don't make a remark, you know, a remark about someone because of their race,

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.200
because you never know who you're standing next to at the bar.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:42.240
It could be their stepbrother, step sister, just because they're white, don't mean a thing.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.320
Yeah, that's true that, isn't it?

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:44.820
Yeah.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.260
Yeah, there's a few people who can call it out like that, you know.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:54.020
Well, I've got cousins and they are white, you know, that's on this dresser's side, you know.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:13:00.980
And there's a lot, like my family, I said to them, there was one year yesterday,

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:04.100
I said, you don't know half of my family, they're white.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:10.020
You know, some of them will say, you know, oh, we got cousins and it's on the day,

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.300
you know, we got cousins of the color, of the color, as they call it.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.340
Yeah, yeah.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:18.660
And yet I think they're out of view, they're a bit racist, you know, what they're like.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:23.220
Yeah, well, it's, you know, we've had it, we've had it all our lives, you know, it's,

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.620
it's not like it's a shock to us.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.260
Yeah, that's true.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.660
Talking about, and that's a, there's a subject that I always ask people about,

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:37.540
because I think the bay is kind of special about this, funerals.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:40.180
Oh, yeah.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.500
Funerals like, you know, your-

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:48.580
Oh my god, I always say whenever I go to, you know, if it's someone I know,

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:54.180
I mean, I can't go to funerals like I used to, but if it's someone I know, whatever,

00:13:54.180 --> 00:14:00.260
I always say, whether they love you or hate you in this day, you always get a good send off.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:06.340
Oh, that'd be some fabulous funerals, like my husband, you know, I buried my husband,

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:11.060
and they carried him from, I just live like a block away from the church,

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:16.820
but they carried him, you know, around to the church, and all the respect you get.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:24.260
And well, my godson, that's the only time I've been out, except twice I've been out since then,

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:31.860
two Saturdays ago, when we were outside at the church clapping, you know, at his cottage,

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:36.820
where the earth went up Butte Street, it stopped at the church for like about 10 minutes,

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:41.940
where we were all out there clapping, and he was my godson, he was 72 years old,

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:49.780
he got buried two weeks ago. But if he'd have been, if that had been a burial in the church,

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:58.020
my god, our church gets full. Oh, and they're on the stage as well as in our seated, all outside.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:04.340
Oh, you've never seen funerals like it. And I can remember going to a few funerals,

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:12.020
little bit back with the jazz band as well. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah,

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:18.340
people for the orders of the crew, the jazz band. Yeah. And some with the horses, you know,

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:25.620
but oh, oh, God, few rules that Tiger Bay, they're most talked about.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:31.780
Oh, dear me. Yeah, I won't be there to see my

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:39.620
I mean, I said to my son, I don't want to go to my funeral kid.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:48.980
I know. Yeah, good job. Good job. We can have a laugh about it. I think that's

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:56.740
me going because I've always had a sense of humor. I sit here sometimes laughing to me,

00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:01.940
like a lot of people say, you know, I thought even when, you know, when my husband was alive,

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:08.100
years ago when he's younger, and because he always cleaned the the holes in the ships,

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:13.140
you know, he worked on the dock there. Yeah. And there was times like when he'd go to Milford Haven

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:17.860
for about a week and then come on the weekend and go back down. And if you say, Oh,

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:24.260
you know, being on your own, I can't sleep on my own. You know, when people say, Oh,

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:31.780
don't you get lonely? No, it don't bother me. Because I, you know, I like my own company.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:40.900
Yeah. You know, I sat with you tonight. So I watched this thing. I watched this thing,

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:48.260
like Father Ted, you know, and then killing programs. And I sit here and I laugh in my head

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:54.260
off. And I think to myself, Oh, it's a good job. I can have a laugh, you know, the way things are

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:59.460
at the moment, you know, if you didn't laugh, you'd cry, you know. Yeah. And I've got a friend,

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:06.340
my friend I've had for about 50 years from London. And she was on the phone singing me

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:13.540
Happy Birthday on Sunday. And she's like me, we always have a laugh, you know, conversation.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:19.620
And like we both say to each other, good job, we got a sense of humor. You know, that keeps us

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:28.980
going. I say, Oh, I say, give me our young days, coming home from school, swinging on the lamppost,

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:35.780
playing gobs in the gutter, playing in the park. We used to have come from another school out in

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:43.140
the street. And we'd have days when we'd be playing coke, you know, for each other, you know,

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:50.100
see who's going to win the game and whatever. Oh, our school days, oh, the kids today, oh,

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.500
they don't know what it's like to be happy. I mean, if you fell out with someone, you'd have

00:17:54.500 --> 00:18:00.420
a fist fight and that'd be it. We'd be friends the next minute. But now they're killing each other.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:07.380
Oh my God, they come home from school and have a, you know, spend the next, till about

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:13.060
six or seven o'clock with friends. And I've been about down our park, we'd go because we had lots

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:19.620
of things put on there. And, you know, if not, you'd go somewhere, you could go to the pictures,

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:24.900
you could go to the bug house, go to the bug house for bloody nothing for six months, go to the

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:32.020
dental and then other picture houses. God, we had lovely nights when we were kids.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:37.540
I can remember, I can remember football matches in the street and in the park.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:48.020
Yeah, and you're talking about that football match, that big cricket match. Yeah. But you could

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:53.940
play a game of cricket on the street, you know, I remember them hopscotch games.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:01.460
Running through the square, one, two, three, whatever. Oh, we were fit though,

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:08.020
weren't we? Let's be fair, we were fit. Yeah. You know, you consider people like the Erskins and

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:15.860
Billy Boston and Clive Sullivan and Freeman and all of those. So much talent, so much talent.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:20.100
Well, they're great friends and my better comes every Sunday, you know, because we're great

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:25.860
friends, going to bring one up together, Johnny Freeman's sister. Very sense, more or less like

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:34.820
a part of my family, you know. And Dana, oh, Dana's mum was one of my bestest friends I ever had.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:43.620
So I come to be Dana's brother's godmother. She's a great friend. So I was hard spoken when she

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:50.100
came. She lived with us for a while, Dana's mother. And we were more like family, you know,

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:57.220
we always have been, you know. But I think that's the thing, you know, when we say, we say cousins,

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:04.980
and some are, but others aren't, but they might as well be. You've got families no relation to you,

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:11.060
they aren't nearer to you, you know, than your own family. Yeah. Like Dana's family, you know,

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:19.860
and a few families that, you know, I'm really close to. Yeah. And people still treat, I mean,

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:25.380
I don't know if you experienced this, but people still treat you with respect because you're older.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:33.860
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And we're an auntie and uncle, that thing, you know. Yeah, often when we're out.

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:40.180
Well, my granddaughter, who both, she always buy my birthday cake and she always makes a big

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:45.140
fuss and gets something that she hasn't done before. Well, the Christmas cake that she

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:52.980
ordered, what she went to pay for, she bought this cake, she told me. The cake is half the size

00:20:52.980 --> 00:21:01.060
this year of a television screen. Big square cake. Roughly. And to tell you the size of it.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:09.460
And she said when she went to pay for it, well, she'd spoken to, because in the end,

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:14.180
I think it was out on Facebook. Right. Because there are a lot of people that know me and she

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:22.980
was to put on about why Nana is going to be 93, blah, blah. Yeah. And this person,

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:32.100
I've known him, he was born in a house just a few, well, his back gate, you're going to come out

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:37.860
his back gate, right onto my front door. Right. Just three of us said. And so I've known him since

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:43.300
he was born. And I haven't seen him for three years. He's grown up now and he's got children

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:50.100
of his own. And I was out a couple of back last year. And because often, you know, people shout,

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:54.900
I'm Auntie Laura. And I don't know who they are because I haven't seen them since they're teenagers.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:22:00.180
You know? Yeah. And then this chap said to me, I come up to the test room, he said to me, I'm

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:04.820
Auntie Laura. He had these two children with him. And I looked at him. I said, oh, I said, I know

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:10.100
your face. I said, but you said I'm Rashid. Oh, I said, you know, because I haven't seen him for

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:14.820
years. Yeah. And me and his mum, you know, we were great friends in my neighbours, neighbours from

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:21.140
down the docks, you know, so I moved up here. And I was getting a taxi home, you know, because I had

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:26.420
my trolley with me. And he walked me around because he was going around that same street as well.

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:30.660
And he said, well, you're going to have to go, I said, I'm going to go get my taxi, that. So he

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:35.700
walked me there and he paid the taxi driver. He said, you know, he said, that's, you know,

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:40.980
what's my Auntie Laura does? He said, whatever. Well, then, you know, the same boy now, he must

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:48.660
have seen on Facebook, whatever, it was my birthday or whatever. And I don't know if he had arranged

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:55.540
to meet my granddaughter or what, but anyhow, when she went to college school, you know, she got the

00:22:55.540 --> 00:23:03.060
cake. And he was there. I don't know if it was chance or whether they made some arrangements.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:09.380
And he would never pay for the cake. He said, I'm paying for the cake for Auntie Laura. And he paid

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:15.140
for the cake. Because I said so when she was here on Sunday, Saturday was, Sunday was my birthday,

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:21.540
but Saturday we had a bit of a do. And I said to her on Sunday, when she's telling me, right,

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:30.820
I said, I said, well, I'm sitting, she said 15 pounds. Oh my God. Yeah. He said, he said, no,

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:38.340
he said, Auntie, Auntie Laura's cake, which he did. And, but Laura, how many kids have

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:47.460
women said that weren't even their kids? Yeah. Oh, you'd feed anybody, wouldn't you? You know,

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:53.700
funny, even today, if you know someone, you know, once a meal or whatever. But I used to have a lot

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:58.900
of kids in the house because I had the string out the back, you know, and so they'd all come,

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:07.460
you know, and I had to treat it. They used to climb. Oh yeah. All their kids, my grandkids,

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:13.220
too, you know, friends, they've all, that's how they remember me, you know, Auntie Laura.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:19.780
But I am seeing them since they're youngsters, you know, like don't recognize them, half of them.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:26.340
Yeah. Yeah. But that's how it was, wasn't it? You know, all your doors always open,

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.940
but that, oh, now you've got to make sure your door is closed.

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:40.660
Imagine someone sat there at the Norwegian church, that cafe where the Norwegian church is now,

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:46.980
not where it was, you know, and it's, and they're looking at all of those shops and restaurants and

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:52.980
all of that. What would you say to them? They're tourists. What would you say to them about

00:24:53.620 --> 00:25:01.380
the docks and Butetown and the bay that you would want them to know about the people?

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:08.500
What would you say to them? Well, there's so much I can say now about it because, well,

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:15.220
sometimes I like to say that they wouldn't like what is changed much now, but

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:25.620
it's not the same. We do have a few, you know, of us, like Dana, they moved, like she's down

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:32.020
the docks, what's your, the Greenstone now, but like there are a few, I mean, where I am now,

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:40.580
I don't think I can name even five of the old neighbours, you know, that live around by me.

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:51.860
It's changed so much that, like I got, where I am, I'm right in the heart of High Street now,

00:25:52.580 --> 00:26:02.580
High Street. But you'd find more people down the dockshelves where I, you know, was living in

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:10.340
Stewart Street when I was younger. There are more down there that did live in Tiger Bay, you know,

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:18.340
but more people down there who might be interested to speak to you or whatever. But

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:25.860
there's not much I can say. The only thing was we were all happy. We were all like one big,

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:31.460
oh, we're like a cold, you know, what's your last name? Mixing everything.

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:37.140
Melding pot, they used to call it. We were all like one big family.

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:44.180
Yeah. You know, everyone helping each other, all happy, happy days for us children.

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:54.580
I always remember, I'm so glad that I was brought up here. I don't think you'd be happier anywhere else.

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:59.620
Right. Thanks, kid. It was a pleasure speaking to you. Thank you.

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:00.660
Pleasure as well.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:01.860
Okay. Bye now.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.540
All the best, bye bye.

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.420
Bye.
