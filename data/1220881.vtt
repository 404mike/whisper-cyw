00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
How easy was it to stay Kosher?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.500
Well, it really was down to my mother, you know, and again other families down to the woman of the house.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:20.000
There wasn't a dedicated Kosher butcher shop, but during my time and my memory there was a butcher shop

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.500
that on sort of one day a week somebody would come from.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:35.500
The meat was actually, the cow was killed in the slaughterhouse in Cardiff and then whatever would come up to Mertha

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.000
and there was a counter that was specifically for, you know, kept for Kosher meat.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And so it was, I think again it probably was a Thursday or something like that, somebody would be there who would supervise

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and tell you a little funny story on that.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.500
Obviously Mertha wouldn't want more than the meat from one animal.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:12.500
So the liver, which was sort of a sought after thing, you know, although I was never particularly a meat eater and I'm vegetarian now anyway,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.500
but the liver was obviously one liver from one animal and that could be divided.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.000
Perhaps one or two people could have a liver.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So there was a sort of a rotor or if it was your birthday or you know, or you had a celebration or whatever it was.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And I can remember my mother coming home terribly shocked in that she was talking to other Jewish ladies

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and they all seemed to have liver on that day.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:55.500
So there was a little bit of investigation and it was found that the butcher wasn't being too ethical and was feeding in non-Kosher liver.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.500
So needless to say that butcher lost his license or whatever it was.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:11.500
There was a slaughterhouse in Mertha that would kill chickens but not, they didn't do sheep or cows.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I can tell you another amusing little story really as well in that my father who shopped obviously was in the valleys

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and he came home very excited one day and said that one of the farmers had given him a live turkey.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So he brought this turkey home and my parents said to me, we've got this turkey, take it to the slaughterhouse,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.500
the shark has come in the morning, I want you to take it.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.500
And I probably was eight, nine or ten, that sort of age.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.500
So I think it's a pretty horrible thing to give your child to be killed.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.500
Nevertheless, I did and on the way a very close friend of mine who unfortunately,

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.500
people have probably told you he was murdered in Cardiff Elliot Fine.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I don't know whether you heard about that but anyway he met me and said what have you got there?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I said it's a turkey, he said let's have a look, I said no, no, no, he said yeah and he persisted

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and we opened the bag and the turkey ran all the way down the high street until we managed to get it.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Yes, so we could get kosher meat.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Then usually on a Thursday when my father came to Cardiff,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:39.500
he would go to the various delis to get bread and smoked salmon or whatever they got in those kosher things

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.500
because Cardiff really was very rich then with kosher delis and butcher shops and things of that sort.
