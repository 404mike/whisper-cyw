00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
First things first, can you tell me your name? My name is Mohammed by the way, Mohammed.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I'm an ex-student, I graduated many years ago. So I'm here volunteering for Roy.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Can you tell me what your name is and where were you born?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:28.000
My name is Sukra Mohammed, that's S-U-G-H-R-A, and surname is M-U-H-A-W-M-E-D.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I was born in India.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
What part of India?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Ludhiana.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Can you explain where that is and explain what you remember of it?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I don't remember anything because I was little then partition happened.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And because I was in the process, my parents decided to come to Pakistan and settle down in Pakistan before everything got loose.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And that's how come we were safe. We didn't sort of join other people in the queue in a lot of killing and division and so on.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So we were, I think about two years before partition, we were in Pakistan.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So do you remember where you grew up? So beyond India, do you remember where you grew up, what it was like being a young teenager or anything like that?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Can you tell me a bit about it?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Yes, my parents, they were very, very strict, especially my father, my two brothers.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
One was younger than me, the other one was older than me, wasn't allowed to go out, wasn't allowed to do anything.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And school was right opposite the house, I wasn't allowed to go to school.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000
My father was saying, if you don't want to do anything, no problem, just pull up or something and have a lie down.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:19.000
That was his attitude about freedom for me. And yet my brothers, they were out all the time, which made me very jealous.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:35.000
What was it like growing up in your household, when the whole girl went younger? What games did you play? How did you have fun together inside the house? Did you have any hobbies or did you play any sort of games?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Brothers, they were out nearly all the time, so I was only daughter and I had to find myself.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I used to make dolls, I used to start sewing things, then mum said to do some embroidery.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So I started on that, I stitched my shirt in it, then cut my shirt and saved it on my poetry. So that's my childhood.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
A very practical childhood. Yes.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Can you tell me maybe a fond memory you have of your childhood, something you remember that you cherish? It could be an event, it could be a scenario, it could be something you thought was joyful in this way, for whatever reason.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:39.000
First of all, when I was young, my mother died. Nine months later, my father and my older brother died.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So time to remember everything is from ten onward. Ten onward was nothing but pain.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So my household was wealthy. There wasn't anything that they didn't provide for us.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So we had a happy, joyful, I'm facing a mistake. My father made sure we had plenty of fruit, plenty of everything, and we had the land, which was given to other people to farm.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And they used to bring every morning, um, some things. Do you know some things? Yes. So bring home some things, and other fruit and so on.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:55.000
So overall, before mum died, household was happy. But afterward, it declined. It went downhill. And especially when my father and my older brother, they passed. And that was hard. So joyful, I don't know.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Not sure. Hard to find it. Hard to find it. But how did you end up here then? Let's talk about travel then. Let's talk about travel. How did you arrive in the UK? When did you arrive in the UK? And what were your early expectations? Can you try and recollect? Was it in quest? Was it a mission? Was it nerves?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:42.000
This was a marriage of convenience. My ex, I kicked him out of the house now. My ex, he sort of wanted land that was coming to me from my father. He wanted that. So I was just something in between.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Initially, he wasn't going to bring me into this country, but then he changed his mind. He thought I might put some kind of a restriction or something towards the sale of the land. So he brought me with him.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And of course, when I came here, it was midsummer, June. It was June. It was beautiful. It was lovely. Flowers everywhere, especially Bellevue Park. That was amazing. So that was sort of a thing that I'd never seen before. I was overjoyed.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And being a young, I had to manage with the children. First, I had one daughter. Within a year, same year, I had a second child, a son. So two children of the same age, me being young, there wasn't anybody here who could teach me how to look after them, how to cook, how to clean. Because back home, I never did anything.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:11.000
So over here, I was in big shock. So slowly, slowly, I managed to get myself out of it.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:19.000
I think you're one of the lucky ones to arrive in the heat. I think everyone has arrived in the cold. Everybody arrived in wintertime, so it was a bit of a shock.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Yeah, it would be, wouldn't it?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Yeah, you had the opposite experience. You arrived in the summer.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I arrived in the summer.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
But you eventually had a winter though, eventually.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Oh yes.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:43.000
How, when you left the country and how were you when you arrived, it's very similar at the same time, what was the most important thing you had to leave behind and how did you feel about that?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Most important thing that I left behind was my brother, my younger brother. He was only 11. So no mother, no father. I had to leave him there. That was very hard. Even to this day, still when I think about it, I will.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:24.000
If I ask anything that's a bit tough to answer, just pass it. Yeah, really it's not about recollecting pain. It's about just finding moments to put something on record.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:34.000
So if anything is too hard, please just, you know, I think it would be best for yourself. Yeah, just pass it. I think it must have been a tough decision to do that.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Yeah.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
For any human being, I mean, that's a tough process.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And especially when you're not mature enough.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Do you have any more contact with Pakistan?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Yes, my younger brother, one I left behind. Alhamdulillah, he's doing very well. His family is doing very well. He's got three daughters, four sons. They all do it fantastically and they, towards him, they're so caring.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Money in his pocket every week. You can have to him taking on holidays and things like that. You know, what children should do. They have a couple of families. Yeah. He's got a village of his own. I mean, with so many children.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Small village. I said, tell me about then arriving in the UK then. So you arrived in the UK, you said you went to Bellevue Park, which is an interesting memory. Tell me about some of the best things, let's say six months to two years, that kind of ballpark, early days arriving. Tell me some of the best things arriving and some of the worst things arriving.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Worst thing within two years, what I told you just now, you know, having a family at a young age, one after another, and didn't know how to look after them, how to feed them, and how to do the house chores and so on.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:36.000
That was worst thing. Best thing was nobody tend to bother you. You are free. Free to do whatever you want to do, except you are under the thumb of a husband. But that was expected. And also ill-lows and so on. There wasn't any of that. Ill-lows wasn't here. They were back home.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:50.000
So, ill-lows. Ill-lows. In-lows. Sorry, I tend to eat some of the words.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:17.000
No, it's okay. I understand now. So, tell me about, let's start there then. So, you remembered arriving in a place that felt very free, although you had commitments. What things did you do with your time that you couldn't get to do back home? Did you pick up any extra hobbies? Did you explore more? Did you meet new people? Tell me about those things. What did that freedom mean to you?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:39.000
I'm sorry, there's more sorrow in my life than joy. No, it's okay. It's okay. I was not allowed to go out. I was in the house and luckily there was a lady living opposite and she used to come down then to borrow onion, borrow potatoes and things like that. That's the only person I made a friend with.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And before that, with my first six months, TV used to come on in the morning and in the night. Night was a bit longer than morning. So, I used to sit in front of it, learn English, taught myself English. And that's what you're listening to now. Heartbroken. Heart-scratched.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I still understand you. Apart from the odd word here. I still understand you.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:34.000
How did you remember the rhyme? I'll take that question. Port, you remember of Newport? When I came? My early days. Within five years the same. Transport of bridge. Icon.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And then days people can go free without cars. And cars used to pay a little bit. And of course, instead of looking after children in the house, I used to take them out, spend a day with them, play with them, come home and start cooking.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And for me there was freedom. And children, in Pakistan what happens, other people take care of your children, well as you do their children. Over here there was nothing like that.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And that was hard. But because of the parks, make a food for them. I had three then. I made a food for them, take them with me as a picnic. Set them down, let them play, do whatever they want. They can stretch themselves.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And that's how, first five years, toward the end, I was missing my brother very badly. And I was allowed to go out of the house, apart from these excursions to the park. And I wanted to go back.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:19.000
So my husband then booked me a ticket, one way ticket. Fifty pounds to spend. I was there for eleven months. When I came back I wasn't able to stand up. I was so exhausted. I was ill.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:37.000
When I went from here, you know you go into depression and you tend to eat and eat and eat. Either eat or starve yourself. I had to nudge and nudge. And I was this size. And of course when I came back I was this size.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:48.000
I'm not saying I'm lost. I'm staying with animals. I think, I don't know, I'll skip that.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:24.000
I'm trying to think about what's unique about your heritage. And this topic is about maintaining links. And what it means is, the first question was what do you miss most about the country? You've touched base a bit on that. So the second was what do you love most about your culture?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:49.000
It's everybody being there, house being there, grew up there. And all uncles and aunties and everybody lived. My great granddad was seven brothers. And they didn't have a sister. So out of seven had five other children.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:16:14.000
So that particular village was from those five boys. And imagine everybody around you is related to you. And that is heaven. Okay you don't go to their house, you don't talk to them. But nevertheless you hear from them maybe your parents sitting down talking about it.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:26.000
So and so done this and so and so done that. In the evening there's a lot of news to listen to from dad, from mum. So yeah that was the beautiful.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:35.000
What have you maintained then out of that culture? Maybe religious practice, maybe just habits in the family household or traditions or customs. Is there anything you've maintained?

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Yeah everything. Over here I've been here since 1966. Friends I made they're still with me even now. They're the same as me, all those two outside.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:17:05.000
And you know because I was third woman in Newport 1966 in Asian heritage.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
You were the first with the them two?

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:18.000
They came after. They came after.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Could you describe what, when you found Age Alive?

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:36.000
A while ago, a while ago. Initially when they started they used to meet in our library. Or some people disagree with me. But I got witnesses.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Yeah used to meet in the library once a fortnight and so on. Then this, I've forgotten her name now. She took over. She was African heritage. She took over.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:18:12.000
She became a sort of manager of the group. From there after that Roy came in. Roy really worked hard. Absolutely. He'd given out all spare moments of his life to this. To make a success.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.000
What attracted you to the group? Tell us about your involvement in Age Alive.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:36.000
As I say I've been here a long time. There was a Talimul Nisa which is education for women. And there were several other groups similar. I was chair of five different groups.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:58.000
And when this opened I wanted to be in this as well. So that's how come I ended up here with the fifty plus. Because I didn't want to sit at home. My brain tends to go fuzzy. So we often talk to people, learn from them, teach them.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
So what does it mean to you then to be involved with Age Alive?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:19.000
A lot. A lot. A piece of mind you get from it. Different things you learn from it. You learn how to get on with the others. In fact all of the group. Because of ethnic minority.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Initially we started with Ashwini. I don't know whether you have it or not. There was me, Rahul and a few others. And we started Ashwini. Before that I started, me and Raheera, we started with the age concern.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:20:00.000
We were the first ethnic minority to have a proper job in Newport to help ethnic minority. And from there on it grew and grew. And we had a few fights as well. Neighborhood mothers.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:19.000
They came over and they said, you sort of are telling our daughter-in-law to misbehave towards us. Basically they were losing powers over their daughter-in-laws. And they told them, we were just telling them their rights.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:34.000
You know what rights are? They don't have to be tied to a machine. They don't have to be tied to a kitchen sink. They got rights. But thank God it's doing fine.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:57.000
And education, there was another thing I took on with the, I've forgotten the name now. On a store hill there was this guy, I've forgotten. Education wise I initially went to, because I couldn't read or write, speaking okay.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:19.000
And I went to the library, pill library. I was with them for one month and they said, sorry we counted you too fast. They sent me to this other guy, diamond? No. Some gem.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Gems. Gems. And then from there I went to Gems. I told them my capabilities. I told them I can't read or write. And they said, sorry we can't take you out. You can't read or write. I said, okay fine.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Went back home. Same night, Rahul and with another lady, they came to my door to invite me back to Gems. And within two years, my pictures were everywhere.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:21.000
And a lot of publicity, a lot of people from home, people who thought they didn't have the time, they start coming out learning English, learning other things. And from then on it's sound. I'm sure I've missed quite a few bits and pieces.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:43.000
So what has being here aided you in becoming the woman you are today? Big question. It sounds like you've had a lot of hardship, but it sounds like the freedom and liberties have also made you quite strong in ways.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Yeah. That's from the outsider perspective. You tell me. Yeah, exactly. Because my marriage wasn't a happy marriage. Financial control he had. I didn't have the money so I needed to work.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:21.000
When my children were little, I handed them to somebody else for a couple of hours. What I went to, there used to be a black closet. It's closed down and their house is there now. And I used to go there and do cleaning.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:40.000
From that money I used to buy children's clothing or anything extra that I need. And thank God I had the ability to push myself, the ability to go beyond.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:59.000
I'm fine. I'm religious. I've done my Hajj. I pray five times. I stay on the right path. I don't have gossip. I do do it time to time. Everybody's a victim.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Yeah. And I do help a lot of people. Whatever they need. Sometimes it's finance. Sometimes otherwise. I don't put that in there. I don't brag. You don't what? Bragging.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:30.000
So take out the money comment. Money comment. Please. Move the money comment. That's fine. I can do that.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:56.000
So tell me about, I understand you've got a brother over there still. Memorabilia, mementos, connections to your upbringing. Do you have fragments of information that you still look upon, photographs? Do you have letters? Do you have anything that reminds you of those times?

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Since I divorced from AX and moved from that house to a different house, a lot of stuff stayed behind. It didn't come with me. But anyway, there was a minimum amount of stuff. And all the memories are here. And of course getting older and dementia setting in and a fun time.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:38.000
The reason I asked as well, because the People's Collection is a giant website of thousands of stories from many different people. It's called the People's Collection because it's not owned by anyone. You have rights to your information. You can take it down if you want to.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:55.000
This is what the film will be about. There is space for multimedia content. So we have audio. This will be typed up into transcript. But there are spaces for photographs. There are spaces for scan. We can do all that here. If you would like to add anything, you can.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:07.000
I'm not a fan of photos. Very rare photos here and there.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
How about letters or items?

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Letters I don't have any.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Lamentos or anything like that.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Letters I don't have any from early.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:23.000
I find early was always hard because we have to realize back in the 60s, having a camera is very expensive.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Very few people had a camera.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Unless you are a very rich family.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Even English or Welsh people back then didn't have a lot. So it's always hard to have anything early. But the point is where this story would sit and edit and typed. There is space for other stuff if you want to.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
There is a photo of my mother.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000
That would be beautiful.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000
I do cherish that.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:27:05.000
That would be beautiful because the reason is those are the things that disappear. Over time, oxygen kicks in. They oxidize, they fragment and they start falling apart.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.000
So it's good to preserve those in digital means because they last thousands of years in theory.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.000
But if you would like to, we will get your contact details and there will be space.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Should I write that as an idea? There could be a family portrait?

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
No family, just mother.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Sorry, mother, mother portrait.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:39.000
She was spinning one day and a brother came from outside and all of a sudden he snapped one while she was sitting. Then she stood up and he snapped another two photos. And they are those two.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
One I got, one my brother had.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.000
He keeps on having them colored, having them this and having them, I suppose preserving.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
It's a form of preservation, yeah.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Is the photograph in a good condition?

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
I think so.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Yeah, that's good. Because we can also get some cleaning up done photographs if they need to be.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Great. So, I'll ask the majority of questions here. Let me see if I missed anything.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Is there anything you would like to say or state as a question to yourself for a question? Again, this is a record.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Anything you would like to leave that may be viewed in 30, 40, 50, 100 years time that you would like to put on record about your experience of, as you said, a young girl that arrived in the UK, probably a bit too young.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
I didn't want to mention my age.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
You don't want to mention your age?

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
No.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
You didn't actually tell them your age? I don't think you've actually said your age?

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000
No, I didn't.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Okay. But is there anything else you would like to put on record or something?

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Basically, my message to everybody and to myself is carry on regardless.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Concise.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:13.000
So, if your great, great, great, great, great, great grandkids come back and they find out, oh, there's a research portal.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
And they said, you said...

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Carry on regardless.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
There we go. Okay, cool. Thank you very much. I think that's it.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
If you think it's now appropriate.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:29.000
That's more than... It's your decision. It's your image. And it's a fragment of one message you want to leave. It's all up to you. It's not...

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Basically, the message I want to leave is don't let anybody put you down. And be truthful. Be upright. Don't hurt anybody. Don't let anybody hurt you.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Thank you very much.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Thank you.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
That's it, really. We've gone through all the questions.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:59.000
I mean, the bit about early experience is I've skipped a little bit. Since it was getting hard, so we skipped that.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000
I haven't told you the whole story yet. And you're already feeling it.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
But again, it's all up to you. It's not something I'm going to push.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
No, no, no. I don't want that. I don't want...

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
You don't want to put that on record?

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
I don't want people to cry.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:27.000
And we all do cry. But that's it, really. I mean, at this point now, your name was spelt S-U-G-H-R-A.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Yeah.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
S-U-G-H-R-A. And Muhammad with a U.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000
U.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
E-D. And what was your address, sorry?

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
It's 41 Corporation Road.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Corporation Road.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Newport.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Yeah, postcode.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
N-P-1-9.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000
P-1-9.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
0-A-Y.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
0-A-Y.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Phone number?

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.000
07-954-682936.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Do you have an email address?

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
sugrasugra41 at hotmail.com

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:29.000
So, with Faz and Age Live Office.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
The day is...

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
14th of the 8th, 23.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
I'm just going to sign here.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
And you've already noted, and it's been on your list here, of things you don't want. So anything about money I'll take off.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
There's possibly a photograph we could chase up later with.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000
And I just said, this sensitive interview, be mindful.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
So, you know, anything like that I'll cut out for you.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
So now is my time. Where do you live?

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.000
So I live in Main D, but I wasn't born here. I was born in South England.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Oh, right.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.000
So Bangladeshi descent. And my family live in Southampton, Portsmouth and London.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Oh.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000
And Plymouth as well, actually. Longer south. But I moved here to study.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Oh, right, okay.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000
And my studies have done.
