WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now we're going to add a few things to our very interesting conversation.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
John, you mentioned the parish of Cumdeidh rather than Ryder at all.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Can you tell me what your connection with Cumdeidh is?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Well, I've lived in Cumdeidh all my life and when I was on Ryder and Cumdeidh council

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
they used to make fun of me and said my world finished at Cumdeidh bridge.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But Cumdeidh is a very, very big parish with a lot more sheep than people living in it

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and it's supposed to be the biggest parish in Great Britain.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And, I forgot where I left it.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It's much bigger than Ryder then, is it?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Yes, but Cumdeidh goes all the way up to the bridge by Clirwyn Farm

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and then on the mountain road it goes to Abergoongie, which is in Cardiganshire,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and Batalough, which is in Montgomeryshire.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So the three sort of counties meet there.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So from the top of the Batalough across to Clirwyn is all Cumdeidh.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So you can see why it's so big.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It is huge, in fact.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Can I ask John, if you went to church, would you have gone to Cumdeidh church

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
or the Nantworth church in Ellyn Valley?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I didn't go to either.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I went to Bethania Baptist Chapel and I probably went there 52 Sundays a year.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Sunday school at two o'clock, a service at two thirty,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and on the third Sunday a service was at six o'clock in the evening.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And where we had big thanksgivings in October, Harvest Thanksgiving,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and my mother and father would bring people home for tea and supper, you know,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and very often the current preacher would come.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And my parents were both very religious, so there was no getting out of it,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
but as I became a teenager I went less and less.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
You know what happens.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Yes, that often happens, doesn't it?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Fine.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
If we could just perhaps say a little bit more about the shearing

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and the festivities that you had there.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I expect shearing went on into the night, did they?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Well, shearing when I was a youngster, say before I was fourteen,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
was all done by hand shears where a man would catch them,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
put the sheep over the cove, another one would carry them in,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and drop it on the bench in front of you,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and then you would shear the belly of the sheep,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and then tie its four legs in a woolen cord and shear it, you know, until you'd finished.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Then there was another man called the carrier out.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
He carried the sheep outside with his arm through the four legs

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and put it on the floor on a bed of newly cut racken.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And there'd be a bar down the middle of the racken where ewes went one side of it,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and tups and weathers, which were male castrated sheep, put the other side, the pole,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and then the man with the pitch spot would come along and pitch them,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and he would mouth all the weathers, and if they had a full mouth,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
which means they've got all their teeth up, they had the sail weather pitch mark put on them.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Then the children's job was to loose these sheep go

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and hand the strings over to a man who had a pen and book,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and he would write down, and then you would have a perfect count at the end of the day

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
of the sex and age of all the sheep.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
I see.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Today is Friday the 23rd of September, 2022.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000
My name's Jewel Willie, and I'm talking with Mr John Jones at Harvard Hardware here in Reda.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
John, first of all, could we just get your date of birth, thank you.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
The 2nd of February, 1948.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Thank you.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And where were you born and where did you go?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
I was born in the city of Reda.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Thank you.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And where were you born and where did you grow up, John?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I was born at Upper Lengvadug, Elm Valley, and I was brought up there,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and I was there until, well, I was 20 something.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And can you tell me a little bit about the building itself,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
how old it was and what sort of facilities you had, water, etc.?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.000
It belonged to the Lewis Lloyd Estate, and half of it was very old,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
the left-hand side, as you're looking at it from the road,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
but there was an extension built later, and there's a great big window on the right-hand side,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and that was a shop when the dams were being built, a grocery shop.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Right, and your memories of growing up, your facilities, access to water, etc.?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Yeah, well, I had a happy, loving home.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:01.000
There was my mother, father, my grandmother, and my middle sister still living at home,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
so I had this sort of love.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I didn't have many toys, but it was a very loving relationship with my family.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And I expect there were plenty of things to do, lots of jobs to do on the farm, John.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Oh yes, there was any amount of jobs.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I always liked poultry, so I used to feed the hens with my mother,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and when I attended Ellen Village School, I always milked a cow before going in the morning.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
She was my favourite cow, and very quiet, and then when I finished her,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
I'd come in and have her wash and go to school.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
So you had your routine.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Yeah.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Lovely, and were your family mainly sheep farmers, John?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Yes, mainly sheep. We kept about ten cows,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and we sold the calves off when they were about a fortnight old,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
as we kept them for milk, which we delivered to the Ellen Valley Hotel in Ellen Village.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I see. Now, some of the main events that took place in the valley, for instance, the shearing,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
can you tell us a little bit about how involved you were in that?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Well, the shearing was the highlight of the year, as far as I was concerned.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
You know, all the neighbouring farmers came to help you,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and we had always roast dinner, and all the women were very busy,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and at lunchtime we would have a game of football, then go back to shearing in the afternoon.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And it was busy, but it was a highlight, and it was always the last Thursday in June at Llanfattig.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So you would, in this way, get to know all the farmers in the valley, would you, John,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and shared a very good social life?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Yeah, I knew all the farmers, and they all went by their names of where they were farming,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.000
not by their surname. You would have Richard the Henfran or Richard Reece Llanfattig, you know.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And that is how they did it in them days, out damp and coy.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I see. Right. Now, we associate the Ellen Valley with water, of course.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
What sort of water supply did you have to your house?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:34.000
We had water out of the brook until I was through, well, I can't remember exactly,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000
but after a few years the Louis Lloyd estate piped it in from a well,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
which was 300 or 400 yards up the field, and it was a harder water,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:52.000
but it never went dry until the hot summer of 1976, and it did go dry then.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:59.000
So I had to go to Kingsfield House in the van and have two churns of water, and that was nothing.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Right, and your family, John, were they from the Upper Llanfaddog Farm as well?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Yeah, my father was born there, and his grandfather and his great-grandmother, they were there.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:26.000
My family, on my father's side, the one side of it, came over from Cardiganshire in 1817,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:34.000
and my mother's side, she was born at the Gunfran Blanier, and she was christened in Langley Hangel,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
a hellegan, and she moved to the clean Ellen Valley when she was four-year-old.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
So... There were Joneses on both sides.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Right, and where did you play? You must have found lots of places to play as a young lad in your farming...

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Yeah, well, there was plenty of places to play on a farm. You could hide behind the trees,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:08.000
but a lot of our time was spent down the brook, joining the river where we was catching minnows and that

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
until I was old enough to fish with a rod and line.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Excuse me. Is it still up?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
I think it's still going.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
It's only about down.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
That's all right. If you want a break, you can have one.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
I'm all right.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Fine. Right, so, did you get around a lot by horseback, John, or did you use a bike?

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Well, both, but mainly horseback. But we used a bike. My sister Joan delivered milk round the Ellen Village,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and it was a churn of milk carried on the handlebars of the bike with a pint measure.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
So when you got into a house, you measured a pint out and poured it in the jug.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:06.000
It's completely different now, but later on we had bottles and delivered them when we had a van.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
I don't think we had a van until I was about 13.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Fine. What about sporting events, John? Did you take part in sporting events at the Ellen Valley?

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Yes. We had a sports in the Ellen Valley every year up to 1916.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
We had a sports in the Ellen Valley every year up to 1964, I think it was.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And it's on the fields, which I own now.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And I always run there every year and rode a bike in the bicycle race.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And I don't think I ever raced a horse there, although there was race horses,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
because our two horses were more flodders than race horses.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Fine. How often did you actually go to market then, being farmers?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
The market would be in Ryder, I suppose?

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Yes. Well, my father occasionally sold a cow or cow and calf in Ryder during the year,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:14.000
but the main market sales was now in the autumn, the sale use.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And we always used to drive them down to Ryder with the dogs, and we never lost the sheep.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And then we got them to the market. We tied the dogs to the rails, and they were there all day with us.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Except one year the trade was bad and we decided to take the sheep home.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
A car pulled up and said, you can manage the sheep, John, I'll give your father a lift home.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
He left his dog with me, and as soon as he got in the car, the dog ran back to Ryder,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
and unfortunately he got killed.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And my sister Joan went to look for him and she came back with a dead dog.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
And even worse, the next day the sheep were no better, and we sold them then.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
So it was a waste of time bringing them home.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
An unfortunate incident, but they stick in your mind, don't they, John?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Yes.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Okay, let's talk a little bit about school now. Can you tell me where you went to school when you started?

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Well, I went to school in the Ellen Village School, which was run by Birmingham then.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Although I lived on the Radnorshire side, the river, I went to the school which is in Brackenshire.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:39.000
I used to walk there every day, and once a year I had to pay a penny to cross the footbridge to go in the Ellen Village,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:49.000
because the footbridge was privately built, I think, by the Thomases, Lawland, Vadug when they owned the Ellen Valley Hotel.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And it was there for people from Ellen Village to walk down to the Valley Hotel.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000
So it was a private bridge, and I paid a penny once a year to cross it.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And how long were you at that school, John?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Well, I started there in Eastern 1953, and I was there until the summer of 1959.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And I really enjoyed myself there. We had a lot of fun.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And coming home from school, there was a brook in the middle of the Ellen Village, and we had empty polished tins.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And us boys used to put these tins in at the top, and a race would get to the bottom first, you know.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And then my parents would be saying, why are you so late coming home? But I never told them what we were doing.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Certainly lots of things to entertain yourself with.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Now, am I right in thinking that where you went is now the current Ellen Valley Lodge?

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Yes, that is correct.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:01.000
But the school prior to that was somewhere else, John. Can you tell us a little bit about that?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Well, there was a school immediately above the lodge. There's a flat in the ground there between there and Stone House.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:15.000
That was built for the Navvy children when the old village was there.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And before that, there was a school halfway up the cabin, not far from the old Lankwill Church,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:32.000
where my grandmother, Alice Ann Ably, taught English, no Welsh. And they come there about 1891.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:42.000
And the purpose of speaking and teaching English was to accommodate all the Navvy children coming into the area, was that correct?

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
That is correct. You know, up to then, it had been all Welsh.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Tell me a little bit about the 11+, John. I understand you were one of the few children that went to that school from the Radnorshire area.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
How did that affect you?

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Well, there was only two of us of my age who was leaving that year.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
The other boy didn't try the 11+, so he went straight to Brintyrian Secondary.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:19.000
I tried the 11+, and luckily enough, I don't know what it is, I managed to scrape in.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000
But then I had a place in Landerindard Grammar School.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:33.000
And I found it hard. I'd gone from 15 pupils to about 500. It was a big change in my life.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:40.000
And I didn't know anybody, only my one nephew, because I didn't mix with Radar children.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
They had their own school, and life was hard on the bus.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:54.000
And some of the older pupils give us a hard time. Every time they walk by us first-formers, they hit us across the head with their daps.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Unpleasant memories, but there we are.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:07.000
So am I right in thinking then that the business about the 11+, was simply because Radnorshire and Brackenshire had their own rules

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
regarding the 11+, and when or if you took it?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Yes, that was right. The children on the Brackenshire side, the river, all went to Belf High School.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
They didn't have to try it. And they were graded there when they got there.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000
But us Radnorshires side had to try it, but there wasn't many from the Radnorshires side.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:35.000
And am I right in thinking again that it's the Ellyn River itself that formed the county boundary?

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Yes, it was. And I mean, I only lived about 200 yards from the river, but I was classed at Radnorshire.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
And I spent most of my time in Brackenshire, but that didn't count.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Yes. Now you spoke about your relatives who came to teach at the former school.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Let's talk a little bit about Welsh, Welsh in your own background.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000
How much of many of your family do you remember using Welsh as a day-to-day language?

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Well, I didn't hear my mother ever talk in Welsh, but my father wasn't brilliant at it, but he could speak Welsh.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
But then his father and his grandparents were fluent Welsh.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:27.000
And I suppose like mother speak in English and my father speak in Welsh, it was predominantly English.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:35.000
But I picked up a lot of Welsh. And when I went to Llandrind at grandma's school, I had a choice between French and Welsh.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
So I chose Welsh.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Right, you wanted to keep it going. Right.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.000
And I suppose your former ancestors would have been all Welsh speaking from the farms in the Llandrind?

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Oh, they were. My mother's family, a lot of them come over from Abergwesh. They couldn't speak any English.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:03.000
And my father's side were all Welsh, you know. My great-grandmother was from a Sputty Estrid.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:12.000
And I don't think they could hardly speak English until Alice Ann Ably married my grandfather.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
And then the English came into our family.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:24.000
I see. What about the changes that you yourself have seen in the Valley, John, through your lifetime?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Could you enlarge on that?

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Well, there's been many changes and not all for the better.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Like Birmingham, you can say what you like about them. They were very good landlords.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:47.000
They were very good to the farmers and they supplied them with poles and gates and hurdles to keep the farms up.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
And they kept the rents very low.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:57.000
But when it went to Welsh Water, everything changed. You weren't given anything and the rents spiralled.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
And that is one of the things.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Ellen Valley has changed completely.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:11.000
I mean, in the old days you could fish from the Cabin Dam to Garry Dee up the old railway line.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
And there wasn't a bush growing.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Now it's like a jungle because they fenced it off and there's no stock nibbling at the new plants which come up.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:29.000
And I don't know, it's so much busier now since the centre opened.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
It's just one line of cars going up all the time.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
And I'm not the only one that thinks it, but the Valley was much better in the old days.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Yes, memories for you John.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Now the Ellen Valley area is part of the bigger parish of Cwmdyda.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Can you tell us a little bit about Cwmdyda and its extremities?

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Well, Cwmdyda is a very big parish.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.000
It starts on the Y there, the boundary between Raider and Cwmdyda.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:09.000
And all the Ellen Valley, all the way up to Clirwyn Farm is Cwmdyda.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
And it comes back across the top to where we joined Cardiganshire.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:22.000
And although Abergungie is in Cardiganshire, the Talug was in Montgomeryshire, the rest is all...

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
And it goes up the Durnall Valley quite a long way.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
So that is why it's the biggest parish in Great Britain.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
And probably not a lot of people are aware of that then.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
No.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
But it's in fact the biggest.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Were you a churchgoer or a chapelgoer John?

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Oh, I was a chapelgoer, Bethania Baptist Chapel.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
And my father was a deacon and a trustee.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
And we had to go 52 Sundays a year.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Sunday school at 2 o'clock, service at 2.30.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
And on the third Sunday, 6 p.m.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
On a Sunday night.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.000
And I went there till I was a late teenager and then quietly drifted away.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
But my parents were both very religious.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
I see.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
And Bethania Chapel, John.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Has there always been a chapel in that area or was that...?

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
No.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000
The old Bethania Chapel was immediately under Garrick D. Bridge.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
And that was one of the first jobs they did.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Build a new chapel on part of Upper Llanfadu ground on the field there.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
As they could bring the bodies down and transfer them.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
And if you ever go in the graveyard in Bethania,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
a lot of the headstones are sloping and falling.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000
And my father said it was because the coffins, the decayed ones,

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
were put in big oak boxes, much bigger than the coffins.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
And when they've rotted, the ground just fell in.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:12.000
And I think Bethania held its first service in 1895.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Which was almost ten years before the dams were opened.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
I see. Most interesting.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:27.000
I've got a record at home of the first money paid in in 1895.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
The collection.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Very interesting.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
So many memories.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Can we go now from the chapel to pony trekking, John?

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
I understand you were very involved with that in your younger days.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Yes, I was.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.000
I was one of the committee members of the Raider Pony Trekking Association.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
And I did a lot of work for it.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
And I always had two or three horses in the association.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000
You know, we rented them out and we got paid at the end of the week so much a horse.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000
And that is where I met my first wife, Gina Day.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
She was a trekker and eventually we married.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:20.000
And when I left Llanfaduk, I became chief guide for two years.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:28.000
And so it was much different then because we'd become nearly all day trekkers.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Before that, the girls would come for a week and they could ride.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
And then you had day trekkers.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Most of them were novices.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Some had to be led.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000
And the only ones I found who were good riders were people who arrived on a motorbike.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
I see. They probably had using similar muscles, I suppose.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Indeed.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
And where was the actual centre?

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Where was the pony trekking based in those days?

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000
John, did it have a base?

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Yes.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Down Water Lane, at the bottom, there's a building there now belonging to Michael Lloyd.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
And that and a yard.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
And the horses were grazed on the wagglo, amongst other places.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
There were fields around town they were taken to when we had too many.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
But that was the real base.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000
And it was a very handy place because that's where the blacksmith came to shoe the horses.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
In the yard there.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Well, inside the building.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:37.000
And, you know, I've got many happy memories of Water Lane.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:43.000
And you could ride the horses across the ford and come out by the triangle.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
So really it was based over the other side of the river then, in Red?

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Yes.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
The wagglo of Water Lane.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000
That was amazing.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Well, we had some down here where Simon Price's yard is now.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
We had ground there.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
That's in South Street, isn't it?

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Where the old tannery was.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Yes.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:09.000
And after that there was some down here by the old mill house that belonged to Percy Curtis.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
But the main place was down Water Lane.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.000
And you rode the horses up Water Lane and most days you turned left for the valley.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
But sometimes they went right and they were going to the Sun Inn and, you know,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
that would be coming away.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
And is the industry as big today or has it changed a lot?

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Oh, it's changed a lot now.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000
I mean, people can go abroad for a lot less money than you spend on a week's trekking.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
It's completely different.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
And the only trekking which is going now is the Lion Royal.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
And I mean, they're not busy like we were.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
They might be ten or a dozen now.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
But I mean, I've seen a hundred horses out with the association in a day,

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
which is a lot of horses.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Sad, the demise of such an industry like that, because it really was an industry.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
It was.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:15.000
I mean, Coontide-Rams and Cornhill and them, they were full every week in the summer from May till September.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
And well, they're not pubs anymore now, are they?

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
And everything's changed.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Everything has changed.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:28.000
And the two former pubs you've mentioned, they're the ones, am I right, in West Street?

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Yes.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000
As you go towards the...

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:38.000
And the funny part about it, not many valley people drunk in the Triangle,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
only the ones who live close to it.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
The valley farmers always drank in Coontide-Rams.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
And that was their center.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:55.000
And I mean, I was in there when I was 14, 15 long before I should have.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
But you could...

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Mother used to come down on the bus on a Wednesday and do some shopping.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:09.000
And if a bag was getting heavy, the one bag, she would just leave it inside the door at Coontide-Rams.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
And the powwls would let you pick it up later.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
And you know, it was home from home.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
Would you say there's any pubs like that in the area now, John, where...

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Oh, no, no.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:28.000
The powwls have been here for generations, you know, and they knew every farmer.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:36.000
And now the pubs, every three or five years, change hands.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
And they're not run by locals anymore.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
A lot of changes.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.000
John, can we just briefly get on to this fascinating family tree that you and your son Tom have been working on?

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000
I understand you've gone back many, many generations, tracing your ancestry back to the Lewis Lloyds.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Yeah.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Well, even before that, the powwls, when they married into the Lewis Lloyds, they were at Lanarkow.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000
And Lanarkow was the first place where the Baptist chapel started.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Before, they went down to Gary Dee and then came down to Bethania.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000
The one at Gary Dee was called Bethany Ellen Vale.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000
And yes, we've gone back.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Tom has gone back about 700 years in our family.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:38.000
I know we've been helped by being related to the Lewis Lloyds because they had a lot of records of their own which are up in Abba, you know.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:45.000
But I'm proud, you know, we can go back so far that our family have been associated with Ellen Vale.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
A wonderful connection. Wonderful, wonderful heritage.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
You mentioned Lanarkow. Is that in the Clarewyn Valley?

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
That's in the Clarewyn Valley, just over the bridge.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000
It's now the Longhouse. It was a Longhouse then.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
And the Stevens were farming there 100 years ago.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
And I think the Stevens is quite progressive farmers.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:21.000
And they went all the way down to Dolly Hill for a load of line to improve the ground.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
And they brought with horses and carts.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
And they brought it back all the way to Lanarkow.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:34.000
And before the bridge was there, crossing the river, they tipped the line in the river at Axaner.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
And I think it killed all the fish from there to the junction pole.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
But this is before the dams was there.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
That's a true story.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
A project that went a little bit wrong after.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
It was going down to Dolly Hill.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Well, that's virtually on the English border, isn't it?

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
It would have been quite a long journey.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
It was, yeah. I know it's down there, not far from Glade Street.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
That's right.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Well, John, it's been wonderful talking to you.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:09.000
It's wonderful to talk to somebody who's got such a proud heritage of the Ellyn Valley

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
and such wonderful memories and ancestry of the Ellyn Valley.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Now, you've got two grandchildren.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000
And they love going to the valley, I understand, do they?

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Yes, they do.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000
They love, I've still got some ground belonging to Upper Llanfairdeg, and they love going there.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
And they can run free in the rivers there.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Well, you know, with young children, the river's a big attraction, isn't it?

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000
And Tom takes Arthur up there to camp for the night now and then.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Wonderful.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
And they also go up to the centre and play on them things

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:52.000
and walk up the back road from the suspension bridge up to the Canoogh Rock, you know,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
on the left-hand side of the river,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
and then come back down over the little bridge below the dam.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Oh, they love it.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
I'm sure.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000
So, long may they enjoy their heritage and their surroundings

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:11.000
and preserve the memories that you obviously have so carefully.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Well, thank you very much again, John.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
It's been wonderful talking to you. Thank you.
