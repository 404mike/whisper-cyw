00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.520
Steve's Stories. My name is Steve Fletcher. In 1990 I founded Swickr Carnival who have

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.000
organised Cardiff Carnival ever since.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.520
Steve's Story number 2. Cardiff Carnival begins.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.560
The first ever Cardiff Carnival took place in the summer of 1990. It was part of the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.400
Cardiff Children's Festival which was itself part of the wider Cardiff Summer Festival.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.920
The project back then was known as the Cardiff Mars Carnival as the primary international

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.600
influence was the Mars Carnival from Trinidad in the Caribbean.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.320
The Carnival Camp is the name we give to the space where all the workshops in Carnival

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.900
design, making and decoration, samba drumming and processional dancing take place.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:01.220
The very first Carnival Camp in 1990 involved three weeks of free Carnival Arts workshops

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.060
leading up to Carnival Day itself when the parade transforms the streets of Cardiff in

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.520
all its glory.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.500
It was free to take part then and this is still the case now. It has always been important

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.400
to Swickr Carnival that we reach out to people from all walks of life and backgrounds and

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.340
there is no financial barrier to taking part.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.860
The venue for the first ever Carnival Camp was Insoul Court in Landaff and the building

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.420
and the grounds were made available to us by Cardiff County Council free of charge.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.460
It was a fabulous building whose history reflects the fortune and luxury of those who controlled

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.740
the coal trade.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.860
So it was a particular joy to see it come to life with hundreds of exciting smiling

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.340
paint flecked young carnivalists and the majority of whom were bussed in from Butetown, that

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.700
area of Cardiff which equally owed much to the coal trade.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.900
I often wondered how wealthy coal mine owner James Harvey Insoul would have felt about

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.220
his beautiful house and gardens being given over to the carnival enthused descendants

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.620
of the dockers and sailors who had helped build up his personal fortune.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.620
The first ever Cardiff Carnival Parade took place as the highlight of the Cardiff Children's

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:28.100
Festival and our theme was inspired by the traditional sailor masquerade from Trinidad.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.220
The parade involved over 200 young revelers in costumes dancing to live music from street

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:40.380
bands and culminating on the tiniest of stages in Cardiff Castle.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.420
I distinctly remember the reaction of the shoppers who thronged Cardiff City Centre

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.940
on that first carnival day as they overcame their initial surprise and smiles bloomed

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.220
across their faces and then they began to cheer on the first ever Cardiff Carnival

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.420
Parade.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.300
The first project was unusual in that due to funding conditions Swickr Carnival had

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.180
to restrict participation to young people aged 6 to 16.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.980
However every Cardiff Carnival thereafter was as it should be, open to all ages and

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.420
intergenerational so as to allow enthusiasm, creativity and experience to flow between

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.540
young and old and new lasting friendships to begin and endure.
