00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
Pauline, would you be kind enough to just tell me where you were born and where you were?

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.680
I was born in Islington, yes, right in the middle of London.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:18.000
But we moved fairly soon when I was, well my younger sister was born there, so we must have

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.880
been there at least four years. That's okay, so your parents did what? What did they do for a living?

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:39.520
My mother was from Edinburgh and my father was from London and he joined the RAF, but not

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:52.800
a young man, he was a cabinetmaker. But he was in the First World War, a sergeant,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:02.640
and he was in the British Expeditionary Force that was sent over there before the war was declared.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.800
And he said strangely enough there were men over there fixing Rolls Royce engines

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:19.920
to German planes and they were working when war was declared, but they had to finish it in order to

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.280
be paid. So you know, it's strange isn't it really? So this is at the beginning of the First World War?

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.480
No, this was the second book because he was on the reserve, and so he was in the British

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.640
Expeditionary Force and he didn't get back till after Dunkirk, we thought we'd lost him,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.880
and it turned out that they couldn't get to the beaches, so they were going south all the way

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:57.280
and they were traveling at night and hiding in the day in in orchards right through France,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:07.280
and he managed to get back in rags. It took some while, I don't think we know how long it took

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.920
before he got back. I wish I'd asked him, but you didn't think of it then. You're young, you're full

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:20.080
of your own life, and of course I was in the Air Force, so yes I wish I'd asked him about it.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:29.680
Did he remain in the, you know, as a member of the armed forces then throughout the war?

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.400
Yes. Right, okay. So what did he do after he'd come back?

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:44.960
Well he went back, he did a bit of work for different firms, but he had ill health

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.120
and he retired soon afterwards.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.600
And so you were brought up in Islington?

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.400
No, I wasn't brought up before, so we moved to Hyham Road in Tottenham,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:14.080
and a neighbor there was an arsenal player, Bob John, and I got friendly with his daughter, Joyce,

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.720
and he was ever such a nice man, Bob John, and we used to go, they lived about two or three

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.480
doors away from us in the same block of houses, and in those days I don't think they went and

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.920
trained like they do today. They used to train at home, and he was always skipping, and they had a

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:41.440
sort of a paved area at the back of the house, and we used to have our skipping ropes, and we all,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:50.640
the three of us used to skip together, so, but then there was the recession. My father lost his job,

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.480
and my mother had to sell the house, it was always in her name, had to sell the house,

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:04.640
and we moved to Southgate, North London, and we lived there, and then the war came.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.320
We had a landmine that landed at the side of us. We were a little joining road with two houses

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.280
either side of the road. It was a link road, but two long roads, and then

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.720
and then one day this landmine, I was actually on leave. When I used to go home,

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.400
the first thing I'd do was have a hot bath, because it was, there were very difficult

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.400
circumstances there. That was when I would be at Horn Church, I think. You had to walk to the

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.600
bath house, quite a walk from where we were billeted, and you had to take your towel and that,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.320
of course, there were never any plugs there, but we found that if we wrapped a handkerchief around

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.640
a penny, that worked as a plug, so you could have a bath, and of course nobody ever cleaned them.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:06.320
So, but so of course as soon as I got home, I have a hot bath at home, and while I was in the bath,

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:19.520
this landmine landed on the link on the road that ran to the side, and a terrible crash, of course,

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:27.200
and it blew in, it blew in our front door, it smashed the side window, we had a side window

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.840
on the stairs, and my mother called out, and of course, no, we had put, couldn't put the lights

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.920
on, because the blackout had come down, and she said, be careful you come down, there's broken

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:46.480
glass on the stairs, so of course I wrapped the towel around me, and I managed to get down without

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:53.280
doing much of an injury of anything, and of course it wasn't till daylight, when we looked out,

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.760
because the front door was blown off, I don't know if it was blown off or blown in, I think it was just

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:04.960
blown in, and when we looked out, there were the row of houses at the side there, and it was like

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:14.080
a gap in a tooth, two of them had gone down, one of them was the men were at war, it was just the

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:22.080
wife, and I think it was just one child, and they'd taken cover under a thick oak table,

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:29.200
and they survived, the whole house had collapsed on them, but they survived, but the couple on the

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:38.160
next house, oh I don't know how many there were there, they didn't, so yes that was a bit of a shock.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:49.680
Yes, but you left school and you became a draft woman, is that correct?

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:56.400
Well I was working to begin, before the war started, or had it just started,

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:03.840
at standard telephones and cables, I don't know if you've heard of the firm, and of course in those

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:12.800
days you had lots of tracers, it was a building, the whole top floor, at one end there were the

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:20.000
draftsmen, and at the other end the tracers, there must have been about 20 tracers, and of course

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.920
the idea of course was that we would trace the drawings and do all the printing, because

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.400
it was almost illegible their printing, so we had to make a really decent job that then could be

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:41.600
copied and sent to the workshop or whoever was going to make something, and of course we were

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:48.560
on war work then, it must have been the war it started, and because I know I was working on

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:58.880
air conditioning for a warship, well of course the draftsmen as I say, although it was a risk

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:06.240
they could stay, but they were joining up, you know they felt they had to go and do their bit,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:12.080
so of course they were losing all their draftsmen, so they chose five or six of us,

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:24.400
the better tracers as they put it, and we were being taught draftsmanship, well

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:34.400
I got well into the course, I hadn't quite finished it, and then my husband who was in the Air Force,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:40.960
he came home on leave because he was going abroad, what should they call it,

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:57.120
there's a name for it, but anyway, so he had a fortnight's embarkation leave, that was it,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:07.120
wasn't it, so I asked if I could take my, that was around about February I think, no January,

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:16.320
I know it was in the middle of winter, so is this 1941 perhaps, or? 1942, beginning of 1942,

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:26.400
and I asked if I could take my summer leave, you know to spend it with him, and it was refused,

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:34.400
so I took it anyway, and when I went back I was given the sack, so unbeknown to me,

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:42.000
the other draftsmen that were there took it up with the Union, I didn't even know that I could

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:50.880
do anything like that, so they took it up with the Union, and I had to go before a panel of elderly

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:58.800
men, very sympathetic, you know, that my, we'd just got engaged actually, so my fiance,

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:06.000
all the story you know, and they decided that it was unfair, dismissal, and I could go back,

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:14.640
but in the meantime I'd got myself a job at COSAS as a draftswoman, they were just grateful to get

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:22.720
anybody who had any idea, but I wasn't allowed to take it, because then I was conscripted,

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:31.680
I was kept waiting I think for five weeks until my conscription came through,

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:39.920
and that's how I went into the Air Force, looking back though, it was such an interesting time,

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:49.760
I'm glad I did go into the Air Force, because I found it was so interesting, I was very lucky.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.520
Your fiance at that stage, he was aircrew?

00:10:54.240 --> 00:11:01.680
No, he wasn't, he volunteered, but he was signals, he used to, he had to learn Morse code,

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:08.240
and he used to listen out and take down, you know, from the Germans and that sort of thing,

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.400
take down and then of course somebody else.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.840
So he was a ciphers officer?

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:24.160
Yes, well yeah, and after three and a half years he got leave, he came home for a fortnight,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:32.080
we got married, special licence, and then he went back to Egypt, he was in Egypt,

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:38.000
he'd been all over the place, Mold, Thuron, Sicily, anyway.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.260
Okay.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.280
So that was that.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:52.800
So you entered the RAF, you presumably were posted somewhere for basic training?

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.440
As a plotter.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:00.080
But you were posted for some initial sort of basic training first of all?

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:06.160
Oh yes, Innsworth I think it was, where we used to go, it was an enormous, you were

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:12.480
kitted out with your uniform there, and then you were interviewed to see what sort of work

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:20.480
you'd be suitable for, and they decided I'd be a plotter. So I was doing that for about,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:29.760
I don't know, six months, but a while anyway, and that was at Horn Church,

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:38.480
and we had a draftsman there who had his own office, and he was mad on table tennis,

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:48.000
and there was a table there for quiet times or rest times, and he just wanted to play table tennis.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.760
He was there, and of course it must have been on my papers that I'd had drawing office training,

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:03.280
so I was approached and said, would I like to be his assistant in the drawing office?

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:08.000
So I said, well yes, you know, it sounded interesting because I always enjoyed drawing.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:17.520
So I was there for about a week or a fortnight, I can't be sure now, and he was posted overseas.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.520
They wanted to get rid of him because he was never there, he was always playing table.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.680
So of course I had my own little drawing office all to myself.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.280
So he had a good wall.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.240
I don't know what happened to him. I really don't know whether he survived,

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:41.760
but I suppose he annoyed them because he was never in the office, and of course I did all the work

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:50.640
that came in that was painting the plaques that used to go around the ops room, hung on a rail

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:57.040
that went round, and all the different squadrons that came, you had to put the number, you know,

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:03.520
321 or whatever it was, and of course they were always changing, so that meant repainting them,

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:13.120
and then they decided that, because I mean, I did my best, but they varied, they weren't always the

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:20.320
same figures, so I had to make templates, draw them out, and then they were sent over to the

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:26.320
workshop and they made them, so I had them, the stencils, so they all looked identical with the

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:33.760
figures. That was one thing, and then of course, because when I was at Horn Church,

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:40.000
they decided they wanted a bigger plotting table because it only covered a smaller area,

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.480
and so I had to make the,

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:53.840
we've built it at Horn Church, and then there was a coach that used to drive us in, the different

00:14:53.840 --> 00:15:04.560
crews, into Romford, and at the back there, there was a very big building that had belonged

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:19.760
to, well, it would come to me later on, and so I spent ages making this bigger table, I know it

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:28.160
it came from the wash down, it just included the Isle of Wight, and it took me ages to do,

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.920
and then almost as soon as I'd finished it, they decided to close Horn Church,

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:41.040
and we were all moved to North Wales, but of course, I was in the drawing office there,

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:46.080
we were at Blake Hall, which was a lovely country house, away from the

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:56.240
airfield for obvious reasons, it looked like a sort of farm, it was a big building,

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:07.040
and I had one of the front bedrooms as my drawing office, which was very nice, and it had a sink in

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:15.520
it for washing my instruments and things, so that's where I stayed until the end of the war, at Blake

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:24.960
Hall. I mean, when you were at Horn Church, and indeed at North Wales, I mean, those were very

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:35.120
active fighter stations, both of them, and we had our mess right on the edge of the airfield,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.840
and we could see the planes going off, and very often we'd stay there, this was when I was a

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:47.760
plotter, we'd stay there and try and count them as they came back, and you know, so often they

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:56.640
didn't all come back, it was very upsetting, and of course you've got to know them, some of the pilots,

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:04.880
yes, and can you remember the squadrons that were there? I can't, there were so many of them,

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:11.280
because they were always changing, we had a Polish one, I know we had a Polish, all Polish,

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:18.880
now that's an interesting story, because all the Poles were tall and slender and quite elegant,

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:27.120
they always liked to press their uniforms a certain way, very particular. Now when I was at

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.680
North Wales, getting towards the end of the war,

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:40.160
we had, they'd been rescued, there were a lot of Polish girls, and they,

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:49.120
I feel uncomfortable saying this, but they were the peasant type, nothing like the men, the pilots,

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:56.800
they were all about five foot tall and about five foot wide, like peas out of a pod, and they had come,

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:03.040
because they didn't know any English, and they were in the mess, the dining room,

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:09.440
and because they didn't know anything, they didn't know what to do, and I tried to be helpful,

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:18.320
I got my schoolgirl French, which wasn't much use, but at least I was trying to help them,

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:24.880
and they were so grateful, and sort of almost sign language, would I visit them that evening,

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:35.120
when we were all off duty, and it was suburb time, I remember, lovely sunny day, and we had,

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:46.960
we were in these long huts, an entrance, both ends, and we, all ours, were in what was called

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:54.480
the rookery, because there were trees there, it was all disguised really, because the rocks

00:18:54.560 --> 00:19:01.440
used to nest in the tops of the trees, so where we were, were called the rookery, well I went to

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:09.680
their huts, and as I say, there was an entrance at both ends, and I was knocking on the door,

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:15.680
I could hear chatter going inside, so I knew they were all there, and I tried to push the door,

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:23.200
wouldn't open, and I was bagging away at it, and suddenly one of the girls came out, oh no,

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:29.040
it took me to the other door, they've got a shrine built at the end there, and I was near,

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:36.720
I almost knocked it down, but you know what, they didn't wear their shoes inside,

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:44.160
they were stocking feet, and the lino, it was that thick brown lino, it was like glass,

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:52.560
it was polished, I've never seen nothing like in our huts, and they were so friendly, they were

00:19:52.560 --> 00:20:02.560
lovely girls, but we were trying to sign language in a way, but of course unfortunately,

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:08.320
all they could do was clean, because they used to clean all the latrines for the Germans,

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:16.000
when they were prisoners there, so that was all they could do, which I felt so sorry for them.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:25.280
Now you also contributed to Air Sea Rescue.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.240
Oh yes.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.520
So can you tell us about that please?

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:42.800
Well that started off by the magazine that John Armstrong brought me to read, and then it was an

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:48.720
article about Air Sea Rescue, and it was primitive, it was in the early days,

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:59.440
so I, because I had already done my stint, because I had a squadron leader come, I think they,

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:08.400
he'd heard that I'd made the plotting table, so I was used to doing tables, and he came and

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:16.320
interviewed me, and said the sort of thing that they needed, explain what was wanted,

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:23.840
and could, I think I could do it. I said well I have a go, and it took me ages, because

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:29.600
there had to be a table for the North Sea, and another one for the English Channel,

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:39.520
and you had to, it consisted of, there were several, I can't remember the names now of these

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:50.800
stations, dotted around the 11 Group, it was all 11 Group, and they were different colours,

00:21:51.440 --> 00:22:00.080
red, blue, green and black, and I had to calibrate each one,

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:12.320
the four of them, all round this table, it was a large table, oval, and it had, it was thick rubber,

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:20.320
and the paint was cellulose, it was actually called salamal at the time, that was the makers of it,

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:28.160
and it had to be calibrated, all the degrees, all the way round, and of course each one had to be

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:40.080
calibrated differently, and then if a signal came from a downed pilot, it could be picked up by

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:49.440
several of these stations inland, and then it was done by triangulation, you know, they all

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:55.760
came together, or went out together, until you pinpointed where the downed plane was,

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:04.320
so they were, I had to take them down to Swingate near Dover, and they were positioned in the

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:12.640
control tower at Swingate, and they were very successful, because after a while I had to go

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:18.720
back and touch up the paint, the paint was wearing off because of the wear, so they were

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:28.320
very successful, so it must have saved a lot of lives. Indeed, indeed, yes. So well. You have

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:33.600
weighted strings as well. Oh yes, yes, that's right, because there were holes drilled through

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:43.760
these stations inland, and it was called a mouse for the general shape of it.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:51.040
It was lead heavy, so it would drop through, and because there was another thing that held it on

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:57.040
the top, and then of course that's when they got the signal through, they'd pull it out,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.320
and that was where it crossed over the sea, that would pinpoint where the plane had gone down,

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:12.800
or whatever. Yes, it actually reminded me of Rod. So this would have been about 1944,

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:23.120
45, towards the end of the war. It would be 43 possibly. 43, oh gosh, there was a lot of

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:28.800
activity. It might have been later, you know, and of course you dare not record anything, you know,

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:34.000
because it was treated with suspicion if you were making notes of anything,

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.840
and it was only a need to know sort of business.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:47.680
Yes, yes. Now you mentioned earlier on that you had designs to become a pilot yourself.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.960
Yes, that was towards the end of the war. Right.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:25:00.160
But having passed the medical and the interview, the war was coming to an end, so

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:07.760
as I said, my son said, what a good job, I didn't get it because I've got no sense of direction.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:17.600
All right, wonderful. So when did you finish with the RAF? When were you demobbed?

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:36.160
When my husband came home, I applied to be demobbed, and we've been very happy down here.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:44.960
So you moved here, it sounds as if it was about 40 years ago, about 35, 37 years you've been here?

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:54.960
Yes, something like that, for a long time. Yes, on VE Day we were all confined to camp

00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:03.840
because they were concerned that there might be a last attempt for the German, the Luftwaffe,

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:11.680
to fly over and put all their bombs on, as the last gesture I suppose. So we were confined to camp.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:17.360
When I wrote a letter which was printed in the radio times,

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:28.720
and I've still got the letter, I can show it to you, a girl got in touch with me, she was in the

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:36.240
army, but we had a small contingent of army there, because when our guns were firing they wanted to

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:43.760
know where we were, where we were firing, so we had a small contingent of army there. And

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:54.480
she'd read my letter and she wrote, read my article in the radio times, and there was enough

00:26:54.480 --> 00:27:01.280
of my address for her to contact me, she sent me a letter and she said I remember that,

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:06.160
us being confined to camp, because I mean a lot of people wouldn't believe it,

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:11.840
VE Day everybody was out celebrating and we were confined to camp.
