00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.520
Okay, so this is Jim Barrett interviewing Mike Williams in his lovely music room at

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:21.640
his home on the 26th of February 2018. Mike has signed the project consent form and this

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:30.000
interview is being recorded for Wonder Bros 25 project funded by HLF Cymru. Right Mike,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.240
so when did you first come across Wonder Bros? That would be at the Holly Bush pub in

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:48.200
Opkinstone in about 1997 or 98 when I was going there for the Ponder Breeze motorcycle club and

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.240
discovered a group of musicians, interesting looking types, in the back in the back room

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:03.320
and got talking to Richard Evans who's a trumpet player and I came down with my trombone that

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.440
belonged to my grandfather that went through the Great War and they suggested I take it home,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.760
put it in a glass case and play this brand new valve trombone that they got from a lottery grant

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:23.720
and I took up the valve trombone and continued. Lovely, so you've been playing before, what sort

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.920
of playing had you done before? Oh yeah, I played in a brass band, I played in school,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.440
Midgley Morgan Youth Brass Band and then when I left I thought where's the nearest band?

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.200
Then it was Lady Unsubble, Lady Windsor Colliery Band where I played cornet and tenor horn for a

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:47.720
couple of years and visited many many interesting places such as Blackpool and Pontains Rest and

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.080
Supermae, brass band competitions. I then gave it up for about ten years and it was only after

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.600
buffing it to Richard that I decided to take it back up. And what did you think of Wonder Bros in

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.800
comparison to your brass bands? Totally wild really, it was a totally different situation,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.760
the brass band spent most of the time drinking actually but within two weeks of joining Wonder

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.280
Brass I was on stage in Brecon Jazz standing next to very experienced trombonists, pretending I

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.160
knew what I was doing but it was great, yeah, I really enjoyed it. Are there any particular

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.800
gigs that sort of stand out in your memory? Oh, there were some amazing times, the trip to

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.440
Paris to support Pont Reprise in their match against Stade Francais, it was an amazing weekend

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:46.600
in the Wonder Bus and we actually drunk the bar dry after coming out of the match. Ponti didn't

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:54.120
win, I won't mention the score but we had a great time. Any other gigs that you remember? Well,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.080
I mean the most amazing gigs I think that I enjoyed really were at Cork Jazz in 99,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:09.280
where we all travelled over by road through Rosley and all the way down to Cork, put up a

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.360
hotel for the weekend and played five gigs, played a thousand seat room, we didn't have a

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.280
thousand people sitting in it actually but they were amazing gigs and the Metropole in the centre

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:27.400
of Cork City were some fantastic gigs and the other players, that weekend we had Roy A's in

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:35.880
the next world famous jazz musician in the room next to us which is an amazing weekend in Cork.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:45.560
Fantastic. Yeah, and sort of, well, how is it, why did you sort of stop playing with Wonder

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.640
Brass? What was the reason? Family commitments really, my wife noticed that every weekend I was

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:59.040
off from this band of musicians and there wasn't any income which of course that's with you,

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.680
Wonder Brass, that's what also makes it so special really that it is totally out there.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:11.520
But it was just, yeah, I was taking up too much time, I had a young family and I had a break and

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.320
never went back. So regret the day, regret the day. But have you been doing any other playing since?

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:24.720
Yeah, I kept, a couple of years later I bought myself a trumpet because I realised that the

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.880
trombone was a bit heavy to carry around and my dad actually, who's passed away now, bought me a

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.440
nice x-rental trumpet from a shop in Cardiff and I continued on with Ponderbury Jazz Club once a

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.720
month. I really enjoyed, I still do. And over the last four years we've got a band together

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.400
called The Unforgiven where I sing, I pushed forward as a vocalist and found out that I could

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.640
sing without making people run out the room so I was quite amazed by that and still play trumpet

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.400
as well with the band. Great. And do you think those are things that you might not have done if

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:11.440
you hadn't been in Wunder Bros? Oh I'm sure, yeah. I mean, I would probably have never realised

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.440
that I still had that love for music, you know, and had those opportunities. It was great. The gigs

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:26.480
were amazing gigs from South Wales Mining Club to, South Wales Caving Club, sorry, to many

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.120
nights in Cardiff at places that don't exist anymore such as the Baltimore and the New Year's

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:40.320
parades out of Cardiff Castle were fantastic. A bit uncomfortable though, a bit freezing cold but

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:49.840
yeah, excellent times. Okay, so you've taken up singing since Wunder Bros? Yeah, I've come out

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.600
to the shower, I'm singing in the shower and I've gone in front of a microphone here and it's working

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:02.400
okay at the present. Yeah, any other instruments you've taken up? Yeah, I have actually, I can

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.720
learn to play the guitar, I can strum. I've been playing about three or four years and I've

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:15.600
got two nice examples, an electric acoustic and what I call a Chuck Berry guitar with F holes and

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.760
I do play a few numbers on stage which is, I think it's very interesting because you can also sing

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:29.600
at the same time. Okay, so presumably you hadn't done any improvisation before you joined Wunder Bros?

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.040
No, that's true, that's true, yeah. In the brass band it's quite regimented, you play the dots

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:43.120
and that's it, and that's it really. Even tunes that are jazz tunes are the set melody so

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:51.520
yeah, I find that, you know, I'm still developing that. I think music is a lifelong

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.520
development really but yeah, Wunder Bros helped me with that. So would you say that it was Wunder

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:05.680
Bros that got you into playing music sort of more by ear, less off the dots? Yeah, definitely,

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.360
definitely. I mean most of the time we didn't use sheet music in Wunder Bros. I can still

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:18.000
remember, still play the tunes by ear that we played in Wunder Bros because they're in my memory.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:25.840
So it's definitely made a change, added something to your musical abilities and

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.200
taken you somewhere that you might not have gone. Even all that, what sort of grade did you get on

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:37.280
the, up to on the corner before you? I think I did great, I remember doing great up to grade four

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:44.480
right when I was a teenager. Okay. That was as far as it went then. So it's sort of taken you

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:52.800
beyond your sort of, as it were, your academic musical career. Yeah, I don't know what grade

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.560
I'd be judged to be now. I don't know. I wouldn't say I was a great trumpet player.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:07.040
You know, I've been seeing some Wunder Bros gigs in the last couple of years at the Globe and

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:13.600
Cardiff, it was a fantastic one, and there's some trumpet solos played there that surpassed my

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:21.200
my achievements. But yeah, it's definitely, definitely advanced my playing.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.880
Would you want to get involved with Wunder Bros again, perhaps as part of this project?

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:36.480
I have thought about it, yeah. I definitely want to expand my playing because I'm just playing

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.600
a set list of about 20 tunes.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.520
And I think, yeah, if I could fit it in time, obviously, I work

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:54.160
forward it five days a week. Yeah, I'd like to do some more with Wunder Bros.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.000
Okay, well, we'll have to see what's possible. Okay. Okay, thanks, Mark.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.440
Right. Thank you, Jim. Thank you very much.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:14.480
That's amazing what you remember. It's that. Let's have you start asking any questions.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.440
Cold as a...

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:27.440
So what's this?
