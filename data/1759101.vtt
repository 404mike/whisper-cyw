00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I'm not sure if he's going to be able to do it.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I don't know if he's going to be able to do it.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I don't know.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I don't know.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Thank you very much for the invitation.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I want to thank the beginning of the interview

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
with the reporter.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Well,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I don't know if he's going to be able to do it.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I don't know if he's going to be able to do it.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I don't know.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I don't know.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
So,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000
during the interview

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
we wanted to give each other a little something

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
relatively minimal for the show.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
What happens if he doesn't do it?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
He doesn't do it.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Do not do it in a reallyanted way and

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
on the re-delicates the living being.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
But in many different parts,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
so that in a company of singers

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
which one frequently meets within the way,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
you will hear as many different parts and voices

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
as there are performers,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
who all at once unite with organic melody,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
in one consonant and the soft sweetness of B flat,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
which I love very much,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
since I got close to Alessandro Huaglia with B flat.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
So, I can record any grade

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:35.420
on the sounds that wereivoen in

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.100
in Cerdorieth too.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.420
More than ever, the work of the composer was creating Cerdorieth for that purpose.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:50.720
And the essence of the song was to know the meaning of the words of the lyrics to fit the song.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.960
So here you can see the main point, the very beginning of the song.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.400
The art of Cerdorieth.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.260
We are one line going on the bottom of the page.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
The first song in Cerdorieth is called,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
One, Two, Three, Four, and One, Two, Three, Four.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:42.260
The first song in Cerdorieth was written by a composer called Hedon Humly.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.260
He said,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
It was a good song, wasn't it?

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
No, it was a good song, wasn't it?

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.260
Because at one point, the composer, the composer,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:57.260
the French composer, the Welsh composer, Sean Gwyneth, was the first song.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.260
Of course, the music of the songs, and this is the point going forward,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.260
the music of the songs was the main point.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:13.260
And it was the source of the music of the lyrics in Cerdorieth,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:19.260
to work with the other musicians and to create Cerdorieth,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
and to write, and to write other songs,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
to write other songs, and so on, and so forth, in the lyrics.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
There was also Robert Jones, John Floyd,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.260
John Floyd, and of course, there was also Floyd in the lyrics.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.260
But this is the first song in Cerdorieth,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
and it was written by a composer called Gael.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.260
He said,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:46.260
The songs and the lyrics are the most important things in the music.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:52.260
I have a different story, not the one I have written,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.260
but I have written a story about the ballads.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:02.260
The ballads are of course, the songs of the songs in Cerdorieth.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.260
In Cerdorieth, there are songs like this,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
the songs of the songs,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
the songs of the songs,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.260
in Cerdorieth, there are songs like this,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
to have a great job,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
to be a great composer,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
in the music, and in the lyrics,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
there is a big hole between the two songs,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
and of course, in the lyrics,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
there are three of the two songs in the lyrics,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
and they all say,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
to the music, and to the lyrics,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
of course, everyone knows,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
you have a great audience here,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
everyone knows,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
and everyone knows,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
But that, I said,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
is what we need to learn,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.260
to be able to live in the music,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:26.260
to be able to live in the lyrics,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
to be able to live in the music.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
But that, I said,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
we have to go online,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
to find a picture,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
to find a picture,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
to find a picture,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
to find a picture,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
to find a picture,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
also we have the cloud music,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
instead, we have a different boat on board,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
instead, we have the cloud music,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
we have a different boat on board,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
and we have to work.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.260
And none other than 들어온 날 마주.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
these people,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
These people are there with us,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:09.260
and the Scythian, the Islamic Scythian, the Fajr Nobunin, the Scythian, the Scythian,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
the Jogini, the Jogini.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:18.260
By looking back to the first half of the last century, we have the renaissance of the Scythians.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:29.260
And we feel greatly indebted to Kha Nidloy, Nathin, and Bethesda as the center from which we had the greatest right.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:34.260
And we feel greatly indebted to the Scythians.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:40.260
And so I think that the last century has been a good year.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:46.260
The good year is the people and the people's success.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:56.260
So for the people, it's a good time to rest and to take a break and to show our good work.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:08.260
Now, the second half of the last century was the time of the Capernaum, the capital of the Capernaum.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:17.260
And that's the beginning of the story about the Capernaum.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:23.260
Of course, it will start, as you know, with the Capernaum.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:58.260
...

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.260
...

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:06.260
...

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.260
...

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
...

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.480
Guildieh Laubights

Don't cut the camera

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.760
Rain more

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.760
The rain is so heavy

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.760
I think I'm

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.760
the

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:16.760
the enigmas was a remarkable man, considered by some eccentric, in connection with the religious in India, he was a prophet sent by God

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:55.760
for his whole soul was absorbed in keeping the commander a sacred institution for the praise of God

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:05.760
he would have no whispering, the sound of a child, the whisper of a carator or the rustle of the door would soon call forth from him David Beak

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:17.760
silence and attention you would have when reading out the hymn for you wish to instill the religious sentiment of the words in the soul of the choir

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:47.760
the enigmas were a great man, considered by some eccentric, in connection with the religious in India, he was a prophet sent by God

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:20.760
the enigmas were a great man, considered by some eccentric, in connection with the religious in India, he was a prophet sent by God

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:47.760
the enigmas were a great man, considered by some eccentric, in connection with the religious in India, he was a prophet sent by God

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:17.760
the enigmas were a great man, considered by some eccentric, in connection with the religious in India, he was a prophet sent by God

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:47.760
the enigmas were a great man, considered by some eccentric, in connection with the religious in India, he was a prophet sent by God

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:17.760
the enigmas were a great man, considered by some eccentric, in connection with the religious in India, he was a prophet sent by God

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:47.760
the enigmas were a great man, considered by some eccentric, in connection with the religious in India, he was a prophet sent by God

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:43.760
the enigmas were a great man, considered by some eccentric, in connection with the religious in India, he was a prophet sent by God

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:13.760
the enigmas were a great man, considered by some eccentric, in connection with the religious in India, he was a prophet sent by God

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:45.760
the enigmas were a great man, considered by some eccentric, in connection with the religious in India, he was a prophet sent by God

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:15.760
the enigmas were a great man, considered by some eccentric, in connection with the religious in India, he was a prophet sent by God

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:08.760
the enigmas were a great man, considered by some eccentric, in connection with the religious in India, he was a prophet sent by God

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.760
My wife Enval.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.760
And we were, I guess,

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.760
two hours in the office,

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.760
so I don't know what happened.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.760
And I read a book,

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.760
I have no idea what happened.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.760
And it's a story of

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.760
the people in the city,

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.760
the people of the city,

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.760
and the people of the city,

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.760
and the people of the city,

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:07.760
and the other워

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:11.760
people of the city,

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:33.760
and the other Leif of Adam-

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.760
is made of...

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.760
fitness, they say.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.760
laughter

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.760
another thing

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.760
that we found in Mercedin

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.760
and it's clear

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.760
that most of the things in Mercedin

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.760
were made

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.760
by the Banghietians

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.760
but we know that

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.760
the symbol of the Banghietians

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.760
was Robert

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.760
Thompson Crouch

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.760
and the woman from the

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.760
Banghietian

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.760
and the silver band

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.760
in 1854

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.760
1854

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.760
1854

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.760
and one thing that

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.760
I think that

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.760
I think that

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.760
that the

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.760
that the

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.760
that the

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.760
that the

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.760
that the

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.760
that the

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.760
Master of the Banghietians

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.760
was the

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.760
that the

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.760
the

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.760
the

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.760
The

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.760
one time that

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.760
was

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.760
laughter

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.760
laughter

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.760
laughter

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.760
laughter

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.760
was

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.760
was

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.760
off it leaves

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.760
and then it offers a more more more

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.760
and then round and round and round and round

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.760
and then double the sum

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.760
and then finally on that

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.760
flutes are trickled

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.760
when I

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.760
cross the boss and then I get

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.760
in a while and then you're all starting to feel

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.760
that I can't really have that

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.760
I don't have a nail

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.760
and I'm not a

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.760
I'm not a

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.760
I'm not a gay

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.760
but really

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.760
it's

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.760
the

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.760
umb

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.720
of

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.720
that

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.720
laughs

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.720
laughs

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:47.720
I'm going to read a book about 30 years ago and I'm going to read it.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:52.720
And I'm going to say thank you to the people who watched my work because I've played in the people.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.720
I'm going to read it again.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:05.720
And the story I'm going to tell you today is that I was working on rehearsing and practicing in a place near the Laman Flag.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:09.720
I think I was in the Laman Flag in Amsterdam for three days.

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:14.720
The Laman Flag was already there and I had to go there.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.720
I was there for three days and I was there for three days.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.720
I was there for three days and I was there for three days.

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.720
The Laman Flag was there.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.720
William Marsh was there.

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:33.720
He was the mind of the music production in his most elementary form.

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.720
Why is that bad?

00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:37.720
He was a very good actor.

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:40.720
He was very good at the way he was playing the guitar.

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:43.720
He was a tough fish in the water.

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:48.720
An excellent player of music in his higher form.

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:55.720
When he left the city, George, the director of the studio,

00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.720
played the violin, Joseph Harrelson, the founder of the orchestra,

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.720
and Gaurav Kastar, the mogul, and the chief of the band.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:07.720
When the history of the brass band of the country comes to be written,

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:14.720
there can be no doubt that Savarta will be found occupying in it one of the proudest positions.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:21.720
And its last able conductor, George Lindley, will be regarded as one of the most urbane

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:26.720
and the top-class leader of his days and generations.

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:32.720
So we see the birth of the brass band and the birth of the brass band.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:41.720
And we see that Savarta and the brass band, through the whole of Germany and Germany today,

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:46.720
are working on organising and writing the whole of Germany in the brass band for some years.

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:53.720
So, keeping the Welsh language in mind and also showing how every event is done today,

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:58.720
I'm going to sing the song that you know, that you know very well.

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:07.720
And the song is written by Otto, who helped me with the film, Dr. Paris,

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:14.720
and I have a CD bank that I play now, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to play it.

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.720
What's the title of the movie, Bingeubec?

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:20.120
Bingeubec is it?

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.620
I can't quite get one...

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:31.720
Today, as I say a few words, I can't think of a better word than this.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:37.720
And then they end up finding their way into history and then taking over the country.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:41.720
That workflow is Mr. feared to say it by taking over in this COVID era.

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:47.220
But of course, you can't do quick marches, right?

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:51.220
You have to do quick marches.

00:36:51.220 --> 00:37:02.220
If you see a woman, you're sure she's not a woman.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:07.220
But that's the same thing.

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:10.720
That's not all it is.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:40.720
That's not all it is.

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.720
That's the story.

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.720
I have a story with a woman.

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:48.720
But it's important to me to see what's different from the rest of the world.

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.720
It's not the technical side of it.

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:57.720
I'll tell you about a woman named Aida Fon.

00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.720
Do you know what Aida Fon is?

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:04.220
Aida Fon is a woman who has been married for over 40 years.

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:11.220
She shows her husband's face to the world.

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:13.220
She sees his face.

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:17.220
And with her face, she shows him the face of the world.

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:24.220
You can see her face with the glasses she wears in the sputniks.

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:26.220
To show the face of the world.

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:32.720
And in the story, in the story, there's a woman named Aida Fon.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:40.720
She has a picture of a white man walking through Aida Fon.

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:43.720
And she's wearing Aida Fon.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:47.720
And at the end of the day, she's wearing a black dress.

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.720
And she's wearing a picture of a black man.

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:51.720
She's not wearing this.

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.720
And she's wearing a black dress.

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.720
And she's wearing a black dress.

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:59.220
And the story is quite interesting.

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:01.220
What is the story of Aida Fon?

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:03.220
I don't know.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:05.220
I don't know.

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:07.220
I don't know.

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:09.220
I don't know.

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:13.220
The story of Aida Fon is very interesting.

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:17.220
And all the revolutions that happened in the last few years,

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.720
and all the revolutions that happened in the last few years,

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.720
were developed.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.720
And this is how it happened.

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.720
It happened in February.

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.720
And as a result,

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:34.720
the story of Aida Fon is now being told.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.720
Why?

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.720
Because of the fact that

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.720
the people in the world don't know

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.720
what happened in the last few years.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:49.720
He carries us to the highest heights of musical inspiration.

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.720
Higher and higher.

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:53.720
Tenderer and stronger.

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:56.720
Now he gives us the crescendo.

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:59.720
Brushing into a loud voice.

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.720
He gives us the power of the heart.

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.720
He gives us the power of the mind.

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.720
He gives us the power of the mind.

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.720
Now he gives us the crescendo.

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.720
Brushing into a loud voice.

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:17.720
Rending the sky and awakening the echo.

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:20.720
Now he wants to be like his soul.

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:26.720
Then in the magic of the imperial voice,

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.720
he rushes to the golden stairs in the middle.

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:34.720
And strikes, seeing above the stairs,

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.720
like seeing above it.

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:41.720
The strong king is controlling and accumulating in force.

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.720
And inspirational.

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:47.720
As he advances brilliantly through the sound

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:51.720
until the effect at the close is simply wonderful.

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.720
In a dark world.

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.720
Different day to do it.

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:57.720
And start the day.

00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:59.720
And start the day.

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:32.720
Now he wants to come to find.

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:35.720
So the theme and theme are the same.

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:40.720
The love of the heart and the power of the mind.

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:42.720
The ability and the need.

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.720
In the piano.

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.720
In the voice.

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:50.720
In the hope that the power of the mind will be there.

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.720
In the piano.

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.720
In the voice.

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.720
In the river.

00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.720
The power of the heart.

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:03.720
For this.

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:13.720
To learn to practice sound.

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:19.720
What is this?

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:27.720
One of his outstanding features was his interpretive ability, not only musical sound, but also of words.

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:38.720
Some of you have heard of words. He was instinctive, with a technical genius, which combined with rare religiousness.

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:42.720
Do you know the tapas? I can't find the tapas.

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:46.720
He did rehearsals, not only in music, but also in education.
