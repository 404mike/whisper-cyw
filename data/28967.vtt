00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
The Upper Avon Valley Collieries. The Upper Avon Valley had five working

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.080
collieries on vesting day. Nantelite Colliery sunk in 1884 closed October

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.960
1948. North Rhondda Colliery, North Pit, sunk in 1908 closed July 1960. Dufferin

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:26.880
Rhondda, unknown which year it was sunk, closed November 1966. Avon Colliery, sunk

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:35.480
in 1877 closed September 1969. Glyncorug Colliery, South Pit, sunk 1904 closed May

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.720
1970. Most of the miners from Glyncorug would have worked at South Pit which

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:48.320
employed 772 men in 1950 or in North Pit which employed 220 men in 1954. Both of

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.400
these pits were within half a mile of the village. Nantelite Colliery, the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.080
deepest of all the Upper Avon Collieries, was about a mile further down the valley.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.440
Work in the mines was both dirty and dangerous but each pit had its own

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.880
peculiar conditions. Some would work high seams other much lower seams as

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.000
low as two feet which meant that most of the time they were lying on their sides

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.960
to fill the coal. During the summer months the men would swim with their

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.720
children in the River Corug in makeshift swimming pools. You could always tell

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.220
the men from South Pit by their strong well-developed stomach muscles which

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.440
came from working the low seams. Whilst the community of Glyncorug was strong

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.680
and close-knit the pits could be said to represent a community within a

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.920
community so to speak. This was no more evident than when entering any of the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.480
public houses at the time. The men from South Pit would sit together in groups

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.880
as with those from North Pit. Not that they were not good mates because they

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.000
were but because members of the individual groups had something in

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.080
common. They worked at the same pit and the topic of conversation was always the

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.940
same. What happened today in their pit? It was often said that there was more coal

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.860
produced in the pub than ever there was in the pits. The largest of the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.660
collieries in the area was Dufferinrondhe, situated at the mouth of the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.340
Corug Valley which in 1950 employed 1,031 men. Located in the village of

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.700
Abergynvie around four miles from Glyncorug in the upper reaches of the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.100
Avon Valley was the Avon Colliery which in 1950 had a workforce of 669 men.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.300
Within a space of 10 years between 1960 and 1970 all the collieries in the upper

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.980
Avon had closed with a loss of 2,596 jobs. In 1961 the population of

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.780
Glyncorug stood at 1,862 but by 1991 this had been reduced to just 1,247, a

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:41.460
massive 33% reduction over a 30-year period. When South Pit closed in 1970 the

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.500
South Wales Mineral Railway also closed which left Glyncorug and the rest of the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.460
upper Avon Valley isolated, effectively cutting them off from the lucrative

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.060
coastal belt.
