00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
And you don't seem to see that sort of...

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.800
A lot of the experiences I had then don't seem to happen now.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.040
I just don't know if the animals were as...

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.280
I just get the feeling like they're...

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.280
I always get the feeling they're hungrier,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.000
you know, they're more harassed.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.080
You know, life isn't as good out there

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.000
from as it was 30, 40 years ago.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.080
I think, you know, they're massively intelligent social animals.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.640
You know, they're not having as good a time as they had.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.920
You know, life isn't as good from out there as it was.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.120
It's noisier, it's probably dirtier.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.760
But certainly noisier.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:39.000
So, just definitely get a different vibe off them these days, you know?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.240
Yeah, yes.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.320
Which is hard to sort of explain scientifically or put a finger on,

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.920
but I'm sure of it, you know?

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.320
I mean, those animals that I was looking at,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.920
you know, they'd just stop and snack on...

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.360
You know, huge shells of mackerel if they wanted, or herring.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.760
Not so much herring, but herring have been pretty...

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.480
But it's still around then, it's still there.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.400
But huge shells of mackerel, you know, the bass,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.400
the seabed was much richer.
