00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Track 5. The almost lifeless lake at Glaslin.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Yeah, Glaslin is what's known in conservation terms as oligotrophic, which basically means it's nutrient poor.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
There's no inlet to it, it's rainwater fed, so obviously we've got a lot of rain here.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
That's why Wales is so green. The rainwater trickles through the peat and the heather moorland into this little glacial depression.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Because of this, barely anything can survive in its clear waters.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
However, one specially adapted species, with a few years of evolution behind it,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
fucks this trend, as Clive Faulkner and then his colleague Tammy Stretton reveal.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
In the lake here beside me there's a beautiful fern.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
But it's not a fern like you would know. It looks like a leek or a tuft of something.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It's a peculiar looking thing, it looks like a little sprout.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
But this fern is growing on the bottom of the lake.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And it's a very ancient sort of plant.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Before ferns it evolved millions and millions of years ago.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Before the dinosaurs, so far back in time that actually it was the most complex sort of plant on the planet.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And in those days they grew as mighty forests.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And as the plants have evolved over the millennia,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
we've seen more and more complicated species come along and they've pushed out these ancient species.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And they've moved them to the most extreme locations.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And so now that particular sort of plant, a quillwort as it's called now,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
has been pushed to the most extreme places on the top of a mountain at the bottom of a lake.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And there they persist to be spotted by the canny eye of the careful observer.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And I think that's a fantastic story.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
You don't tend to generally see it obviously because it's in the water,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
but if there's been a kind of a storm or strong winds like we've got today,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
you can get it washed up on the shoreline. So it's worth having a look out on the shore for it.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
At first glance the wildlife around the lake may appear relatively minimal too.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
But take a look in the small pools and waterlogged areas within the heather.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And you may discover a dark world.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
If you are an insect anyway.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And the pools themselves can provide habitats for frogs and toads,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
for dragonflies and damselflies, and some unusual plants as well.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
In the blanket bog areas there's a little plant called a sundew, which is very, very tiny,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000
but it's insectivorous and it's got sticky little globules on it, which it catches insects.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Now it doesn't rely on those completely.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
It still photosynthesises like other plants do, getting the energy from the sun.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
But because bogs are very nutrient poor, they supplement their diet, if you like, with insects.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Turn right along the northern edge of the lake and cross over a small wooden boardwalk bridge.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Continue ahead through a metal gate and pass the Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust plaque on your right.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Shortly after, listen to track 6, besides the small sign directing walkers to the viewpoint.
