00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.100
The gambling corner now, yes illegal right, but they gambled in the street. It's the only place in Great Britain

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.500
They gambled in the street and what I'm talking about, you're taking half of a street

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.840
There'd be different schools like that. One what they call dollar dollar

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.640
You couldn't be broke because you could stand on a gambling corner. You can go down there with no money, right? Somebody wins

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.200
Now they had one side, they knew he was skin so when he passed somebody say oh yeah go and try your luck

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.640
He's half a crown

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.320
That's twelve and a half P, but half a crown was half a crown. You'd go then you see they start off

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.840
games

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.160
You could see the girls all come on losses over here

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.340
That means the ones like it's gonna pay six pence six pence

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.560
Then you work your way up. You might get you might say I do a shinnin you might work your way up to ten bob

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.020
That's 50 P. So you say well

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.760
You're going to try dollar dollar

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.040
That's five shillings five shinnings 25 P 25 P

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.060
Well, you might win there you might go then he goes you got into the pom-pom

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.720
But I'm reading a big game then it wasn't many in net and when he goes like that

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.600
So you've brought one game say that I don't know. They goes that give you gone big time

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.560
Hang on and he'd be watching you then like a cinema. They go

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.280
Die you moved up the first division too quick

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.000
No, well, you you've taken about two hours to get a poem

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.040
You've gone there and before you touch today

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.000
So you put the poem down someone touched it and give you what they call a nick at the door

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.160
They goes it was a death blow. You know, we never looking

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.280
And he had all kind of jokes even about

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:44.260
You know gambling they say you couldn't be a lucky and so so Johnny Erskine's a favorite for telling tales. He said that

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.120
Johnny Erskine

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.800
He's dead. He said you couldn't he said you couldn't but I'm no bad luck and so so he mentioned some

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.720
Name whenever you heard of him. He said the man never gambled in his life

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.100
He said he only bent down like that look and he said his wage packet dropped out of his pocket before

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.840
No, where is he said he named something touched it and as he shot the dice he said a nick him

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.200
He said the man don't even gamble but once your money's on a floor seat, you're entitled to touch it and shoot the dice

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.620
He's on top of that. He said he's dead. Thanks. Oh my god. What do I do? He said the car combined

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.840
He said that's where you go bad luck

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.920
But yet see nobody wouldn't wouldn't gamble with Johnny you see yet

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.520
Well, you'd have to understand those games. You could have a lot when you you can go in that corner and you'd have a laugh

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.760
You know, I may be what these come mixers like, you know, they'd there'd be one night

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.620
You know, you're throwing dice on a curb stones. See you know on the curb some well sometimes the dice would

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.120
Rest in the curb some it's a lane flat. So

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.760
They go well, what is it is it a six or is it you know or a two

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.560
So they go right call an outsider

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.540
Nobody in our game can't give the decision. He goes call an outsider

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.080
So you better call someone across the road and he don't know if you threw the dice on him

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.880
He goes what did I look like a six or a three?

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.020
And he always gotta be an old timer. See you know, you had some wicked old timers

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.000
You get cracking and he goes who threw him?

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.040
So

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.680
One would before it could say anything. It was me

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.360
if he thought like you're one of them but when you win you give him five shit and she goes

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.800
Man, anyone could see that's a six

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.680
Well, you're calling me for stupidness like that for this plane. That's a six and then the agony was that one say you're dirty old cripples

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.640
They said your mother should have strangled you at birth

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.640
No, see though Louie James

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:48.000
You know Louie James, he's some dumb ass clothes that he brought up ten kids five girls five boys

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.400
Now he was another clone like, you know, he he had a rude mouth like you know, but he didn't mean it he had

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.680
He'd come there no and he was

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.760
He was a good gambler, but a trouble, he's gambling all he owes keeping money

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.880
See he'd come like this he wouldn't be hanging around he'd come and put it down already go one time

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.200
I'd like you know what we call shit. I'll bust you either win or you don't he don't believe it hanging around

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.320
I put it

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.320
He you know, you had different characters in

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.160
Louie can guarantee if Louie was in again, there's gonna be a fight after

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.880
You know, he he likes he just like to fight

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.000
You know he he likes he just like to fight

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:40.040
Well, he wasn't my uncle yes, he wasn't nobody wasn't shot it wasn't over gambling that he was standing on a gambling corner

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.960
And another man come behind him his countrymen and shot him

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.880
So the end of my father was standing there. No, you've seen cripples, but it was slow run that day

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.520
Only well that for what I thought what happened now

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.320
That man was a seam the man has shot him

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:08.760
Well, apparently he was going to see and leaving money to this man to send them to his family his mother like in Somalia

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.920
When he come home from see apparently this man had been sending her money

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.920
So what I heard he was gambling it

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:24.000
Well, I've lost much remember when he heard he come on we heard his one of his family something died

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.680
back home through

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.200
You know no aid no money. So no man just took up the gun and shot him
