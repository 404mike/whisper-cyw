00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.240
What was the music scene like then? Newport in the early 70s?

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:37.840
Well, to be honest with you, I wasn't that familiar with it. I certainly wasn't part of it.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.880
Is that because you come from A-Men Corner?

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.720
It's hard to say really. I was kind of not that interested at the time in the music. I had my teeth

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:57.920
into the fashion thing. A-Men Corner finished in 1970. I formed a band called Judas Jump under

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:05.040
Don Arden's management, which lasted only about a year and a half. We made a couple of singles and

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.960
album and then we basically decided to call it a day. It wasn't going anywhere. So I decided to come

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.960
back to Wales. I just had enough at London at the time. I was with my girlfriend, a Swedish girl

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.280
called Britt, who was lovely. I decided to come back to live in Newport for a while just to get

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.720
my thoughts together. Whilst I was there, I met up with Paul Hanbury, who was one of the partners in

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.360
the shop called Clobber that was based in Cardiff Road. He had a partner called Gerald Davis.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.840
They were running the shop. Then I came back and I had a few quid spare. I said,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:52.320
do you fancy having a partner? They agreed that I could join as a third partner. Then we developed

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:01.840
the shop from there and it went on. You migrated over from the music business into the fashion

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.360
business. It wasn't intended to be long term or anything. It was just something else to do.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:16.320
I got fed up with the politics of the rock and roll business for a while. It was a difficult time,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:24.960
especially with Arden managing and all that. Don Arden was famously Sharon Osborne's father.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.360
He was a sink or swim kind of thing. There was a lot of money put into it. It was like a hype.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.600
It was signed to EMI. There were hoardings in London all over the place on the tube.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.760
There was Front Page of the NME. There was loads and loads of publicity being put out there as a

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.920
super group, which is a little bollocks really to be honest with you because we were never a super

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.320
group. He wanted to create a super group kind of band. I picked other band members from other

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.480
bands. Andy Bound from The Herd, Henry Spanetti on drums, Charlie Harrison who went on to be Poco

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.520
and a couple of other guys. One other guy, Julian Williams who became head of Sony.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.360
Richard, you were around Newport in the early 70s I believe.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:23.840
I left school in 16. I was 17 in 1970. I was living in Cardiff. It was really Cardiff that

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.880
I was familiar with during the 70s. The moon, the top rank, places like that. It wasn't until

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:40.320
well, I went to the Cardiff Art College in 1971. I spent a year there and then moved over to Newport

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:47.280
in 1972. So it was in 1972 that I arrived in Newport. You were there as well Alan in 1972?

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.000
Yeah, I was there. By then we'd opened up the shop probably in Skinner Street.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:04:00.320
What are you making of Newport then? It was pre-punk I guess you'd call it, glam.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.880
Where did the bands play? It was the time of Prog Rock wasn't it? I don't know about Newport

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.640
bands. I'm trying to think of the bands that would have been around at that time. You know the bands

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:17.360
like Oswald Orange, some odd names. They became racing cars right? Yeah, yeah. Kensington was the

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.120
club at the time. Tell us a little bit about that Alan because this would have been like almost the

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.400
TJs of the early 70s in Newport I guess. It was the Rock Club in Newport wasn't it? Well you know

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.760
who ran that, it was Julian's father. Julian Blake's father yeah. Julian Blake's dad. Newport legend

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:41.280
Julian Blake. And his wife Marilyn ran the club and they were getting a guy called Alan Gardner

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.680
was managing it and a guy called Ricky King who was the DJ and they were bringing in lots of bands.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:56.640
I mean well Amen Corner played there but you know people like Roxy Music, Dr John, Status Quo,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.280
you know a lot of the touring bands at the time they were getting the pick of the crop really.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.280
I think they had an agent in London who was helping them out with the bands.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.280
And didn't that eventually burn down I think? Yeah I think the only idea I don't quite know exactly

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.600
what happened. I have no idea but it was a place to go you know for sure you know it was a fun

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.040
place and it was quite happening at the time. How about you Rich? Were you a gig goer? I know you were.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:30.320
Yeah well yes but it was more, the thing is we had the Students Union on Stow Hill.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:37.120
When I was a student in Cardiff in the art college I'd go to the gigs in the Students Union. I mean

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.520
one of the best things about becoming a student in Cardiff was the fact that I got a union card

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.640
that I can get into places you know so now I've seen all the bands that you know it was difficult

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.000
to get into. But the Students Union on Stow Hill we had a hall out the back and it was there that

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.600
we used to have bands once a month and there'd be the sort of discos and stuff like that and

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.360
occasionally we'd go to the Kensington but we were pretty much in this sort of, we'd stick to

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.200
the union and in fact we would go over to Cardiff more than we would anywhere else because Cardiff

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.960
had a pretty good music scene really you know. I'd got to know Shaking Stevens while I was in

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:21.760
Cardiff Art College and he used to play over the pageant rooms and his manager Legs Barrett,

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.080
I got to know him as well and Legs was managing a Newport band called Crazy Cavern and the Rhythm

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:36.240
Rockers and it was Crazy Cavern, I sort of, were the first band that I came across in Newport as a

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.680
sort of a Newport band and I mean they were, I think John Peel once said something like down

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.560
there in Newport they've never heard of a rock and roll revival because it's never died and these

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.080
blokes were playing from the early, well they were playing in the 60s, I mean they were,

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.160
well they only stopped playing because Cavern sadly died and they were the first band,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.920
Newport band that I went and see, in fact I went to see them in Corporation Road in the Corporation

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:07.840
Hotel, I remember going to see it and at the back of the hotel was a hall and they used to have these

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.160
country and western nights where everybody dressed up as cowboys and took guns along,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.720
I think they were pretend ones. What year would this have been do you think?

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:21.840
At 72, 3 something like that, it was early, fairly early and they would, that's where I first saw

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.840
them, I saw them playing in there and then I saw them in various other places around Newport,

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.080
I can't remember all of the places but I got to follow them quite regularly because I like

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:38.720
rockabilly and rock and roll. Yeah they were legendary Newport bands, did you know them Al?

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:44.160
Well I remember, no when I go back before that to the days of the majestic which is back in the 60s

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.600
so that's another story you know and that was the place where you'd see, I saw, do I see there,

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:55.840
Gene Vincent, Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames, you know all the Mersey Beats, all the Mersey bands,

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.800
Zoop Money, I mean it was a great scene I thought when I was growing up but I was

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.520
in my teens then you know it was a different story altogether. How did you get into music Alan

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:14.080
and Newport, what was the way in for you? Well I just, I was a big fan, I was going to shows

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:19.040
when I was probably about 12 or 13. It was the Majestic Ballroom, I would go back to Gene Vincent

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:25.040
in his leather suit and his one leg, you know the one leg with the leg behind him, he broke his leg

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.840
or he had a bad, he had a dummy leg you know that he broke in a car accident or something or a

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.720
motorbike crash or whatever it was and I remember him playing at the Majestic with, you know,

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:40.640
it was kind of iconic to see him, it was amazing to see him play there and it would have been

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:50.240
65, what about 65? Oh yeah I was a teenager, I was, yeah yeah, I mean I was in, I was in

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:56.160
heaven, it was great, it was the best thing I've ever seen I think. The roof, the roof, you know,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.720
was blown off the place. That was the key to it all as far as I was concerned, that was when I was

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.160
growing up, that's formed a lot of my early knowledge of, you know, of music and got me

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:12.000
excited about it. I know nothing of the Majestic, where was it exactly? On Stowe Hill, right next to

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.960
the Penn and Lee, right at the bottom of Stowe Hill. When did it close in the 60s?

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:28.160
Probably late 60s I'd say, early 70s, they had a Saturday morning club, you know, we could go,

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.160
the guy would be playing all the jive records and stuff, I mean it was really the place to go

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.320
back then, but that's where I saw my first bands, you know, when I was growing up and then I was

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:44.560
going to see package shows in Cardiff at the Capitol, saw The Beatles with Roy Orbison,

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:50.880
Jerry and the Pacemakers, saw The Stones with Ike and Tina Turner, saw, you know, just reading

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:57.840
and the Stax review, I mean it just went on and on, but I even remember The Allisons and sort of,

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.560
you know, really NAF bands that were actually touring, playing the Colston Hall, and I was

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:09.360
about 14, I think, or 15, so I mean and then the Majestic was like a regular event and it was

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.880
one of the, you know, it was very kind of either, you're either a teddy boy or a mod,

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:18.480
right, so there were quite often a few of argy bargies there, depending on which side of the room

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:23.760
you were on, it was a bit hairy, you know, but the girls were there, you know, they'd like to dance,

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.840
I was quite good at driving at the time, I remember, but I saw some great bands and like,

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:35.040
then I joined a band, I saw, actually I saw Sounds Incorporated playing, they were like an

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:40.080
instrumental band really, with six piece, with horns, and I saw the guys playing the horns,

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.880
I thought from that time onwards I really wanted to play sax, so that's why I got a saxophone,

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.200
and it went on from there, and Andy used to come up from Cardiff to see the bands.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.480
Had he fair weather low?

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.840
Yeah, he used to come, I used to see him, and I was in a band called Five In Hand then,

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.880
and I was singing and playing a bit of sax, and Andy was always there, so I guess I got to meet him,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:06.080
and it kind of went on from there, you know, but that's 60s, that's 60s, and then I promoted

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:12.160
stuff myself in the top rank back in 70s, but that was all, a lot of that was reggae,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.480
I did a lot of reggae stuff, field pass, you know, third world.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:21.040
When you've had a life in kind of music culture, really Alan?

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.080
Yeah, I dipped in and out of it, you know.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:29.360
You've always seemed to have been in it, in music or fashion in some way, if not for promotion,

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.320
you know, promoting.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.400
I can't think of anything else that interests me really.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.520
You just can't get a job.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:39.920
No exactly, create your own work, you know, you know, yeah.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.400
And Richard, I know we haven't mentioned this, but you've kind of had a career in

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.600
tell me, tell me what you've worked in.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:53.520
I've worked in housing and homelessness, and I was a psychiatric nurse, but the one thing

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:59.120
which I've always done is having been to art college, I always believed that everybody

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:04.720
ought to go to art college, and that everybody had the potential of something within them,

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:09.200
and I believe that when I was running this homeless organisation, that all the homeless

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.040
people that we dealt with had something that they could do.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:18.000
So I raised nearly two million pounds to build the first purpose-built art centre for homeless

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.040
people in Britain.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:24.640
There were day centres in Britain, but this was a purpose-built art centre.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.640
What year was this?

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.840
That would be, it was after the 70s, unfortunately.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.840
It was later.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.840
That's okay, it's worth talking, it's certainly worth mentioning.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.240
We had a recording studio in there, we had an art room, ceramics, pottery, we taught

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.240
people how to play music.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.240
When was that, Rich?

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:50.240
It was on the corner of Dock Street and George Street, it's in the old Jessamyns building.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.240
Prince Charles and his son opened it, William.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:58.960
So it was opened when he finished university, so I don't know what year that was, but the

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:04.480
thing was it was, you know, and it was absolutely fantastic, and I think it was a great

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.720
experience, you know, and it was absolutely fantastic because there was nobody who couldn't

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.720
do something.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:15.520
In fact, I've got two albums here which were produced by them, and I've even got another

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.520
album over here which was all about the Chartists.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:25.520
It was all about Alex's books, his stories.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:31.520
So it was fantastic, but sadly it's closed now, and, you know, I think that people had

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:37.360
been, especially people who had been excluded from all sorts of things, to give them the

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:43.520
opportunity to express themselves some way, musically or artistically, gave them confidence

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.800
and it would, you know, move them along and help them get out of the situation they found

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.080
themselves in, but it doesn't happen these days.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.520
That's a shame, God.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.640
It is, really.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.000
And what's there now?

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.600
Is there anything there now?

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.320
It's accommodation.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.320
It's accommodation.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.320
Wow.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.320
That must have been the 80s, was it?

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.320
Late 80s.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.320
Late 80s, I'd say.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.320
Late 80s, because I was away.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.320
Yeah, that's good.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.320
If you'd have been around then, Alan, I would have pestered you to come over and do

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.320
something, you know, talk about something.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.320
I would have loved to have done that.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.320
Oh well.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:30.320
Benji did come in once on one occasion because he was recording just up the road in that

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.320
Notting Hill studio.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.320
I remember Benji when he was a teenager, toasting.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.320
Yeah, yeah, and down Cardiff, down to Casablanca.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.320
Yeah.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:48.320
I haven't said this yet, but obviously you opened Paradise Garage in Cardiff in the

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.320
late 70s, right?

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.320
Yeah.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.320
That was kind of a punk shop.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.320
Then you took it to LA.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.320
Yeah, it was in Bristol first, you know.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.320
It was in Bristol.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.320
I'd invested in the shop in Clobber.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.320
We grew the shops.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:10.320
We eventually opened one in Skinner Street, which was the alternative to the one in

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.320
Cardiff Road.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.320
And then we opened a bigger shop down the road on the corner of Skinner Street and Dock

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.320
Street, opposite Arnold's Lighting Emporium, which is still there.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:26.320
And, you know, it was quite a popular shop and we were selling all the latest sort of

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.320
clothes, you know, mostly men's wear.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:34.320
So it was fairly straight kind of clothing, really, although it was kind of fashionable

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.320
at the time.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:42.320
And so then the other little shop that is in the street became more the alternative shop

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.320
and I was kind of more responsible for buying stuff for that.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.320
It was back and forth to London then.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.320
Again, going back and forth.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.320
My girlfriend had good contacts with Kensington Market.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:56.320
I was buying a lot of stuff from there and stuff that people hadn't seen before in Newport.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.320
So it became quite a trendy shop.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.320
Where would people go?

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.320
What clubs or pubs?

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.320
Well, I don't know.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:10.320
Eventually, I think before, I'm not sure what they were doing between 72 and 74, but in

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.320
74 we opened Rudy's, which was the nightclub.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:16.320
And that lasted for years because I used to go there in the 80s, you know.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.320
Yeah, which became the place to go on a Friday or Saturday night.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:30.320
It was kind of like a bit more at market sort of strict dress code, you know, but not posh.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.320
It wasn't posh.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.320
But it was a lovely place.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.320
It had a nice decor and we had a dance floor and a good DJ.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.320
It was quite a cool place to go.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.320
It used to get absolutely ram-packed.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.320
Well, it changed a lot because we were doing all the disco stuff then, you see.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:50.320
So, and then everybody that was in, you know, a lot of customers from the shop would actually

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.320
go congregate and go to Rudy's.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.320
It became the place to go.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.320
So you had the fashion shop and the club too?

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.320
Yeah.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.320
And then, and then clobber carried on and we opened up about three or four more shops.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.320
So we had about six shops in the end.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:10.320
And eventually I was back and forth to the King's Road every week practically, buying

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.320
stuff for Bristol because Bristol became more of my little baby.

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:20.320
So I was buying all the cool stuff that they wouldn't have sold in Newport and putting into the Bristol shop.

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.320
I was traveling up every week.

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:30.320
I was picking up bin liners of stuff all over the King's Road and up to Hackney and all over London really.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.320
And it was fun. It was so much fun.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.320
And I'd come back, you know, we'd put stuff on sale.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.320
We'd sell the stuff on a Saturday and I'd go back up again the following week.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.320
It was back and forth all the time to London.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:45.320
So I was really aware of the punk thing that was coming along the tunnel.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:49.320
You know, nobody else could, you know, because I was there all the time.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.320
Yeah.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.320
What were you doing there?

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:56.320
Sorry, I was just going to switch over to ask Richard what he was doing.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:06.320
Well, one of the things that had happened whilst I was in Cardiff, it does follow in, it follows on to Newport, was that

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:13.320
we got involved with showing a film about Stokely Carmichael and the Black Panthers.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:18.320
And we took it one day down to the paddle steamer in Tiger Bay.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.320
And it was during the coal miners strike.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:28.320
And halfway through the film where Stokely Carmichael was stirring everybody up, there was a power cut.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:34.320
And we were the only white people in the room and the place was getting a bit, felt very hostile.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:39.320
Anyway, somebody stood up with a torch and said this bloke's a bad man, really.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:43.320
You know, the working class people should be standing together and all this sort of business.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:48.320
Anyway, so we became good friends and we used to go down there fairly regularly as a group of students.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:53.320
But it was there that I was introduced to this thing called toasting.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.320
I'd never heard of it. I didn't know what it was.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.320
I mean, some people now would call it rapping.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.320
Yeah, improv.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.320
It was toasting then. They'd have a sound system set up in the paddle steamer.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:11.320
And they'd have this music playing and then somebody would just jump up and do this sort of toasting.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:15.320
And then we used to go down there regularly as students and we used to enjoy it.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:23.320
But when I came to Newport, there was another one of these places at the Silver Sands, which was down in Pill,

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:28.320
which was very near to Bolt Street, which was part of the art college.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:37.320
So this was one of the sort of local places that we were using regularly on a kind of it was I seem to remember it was a Saturday night.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:42.320
It was a we go there on a Saturday and then we'd go to the Hastings, which was on the other side of the road.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:49.320
We'd wait until the police had raided it because it was generally a raid every week or so.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:53.320
They take someone away, they get busted and then everybody collects and pay the fine.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:20:00.320
But I mean, you'd walk down these steps into the basement and it was thick with the smoke of cannabis.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.320
I mean, you had a choice when you got down there. Don't buy any or just get stoned.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.320
And that's mostly what our students did because we couldn't afford to buy it.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:13.320
So it was a great place for us to go to get stoned for free.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:21.320
And that's where, you know, that's where I went with Woody, who became Joe Strummer.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.320
And it was where we would used to go down there with a gang of us.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:33.320
You know, much is much has been written and spoke about the myth of Woody, Joe Strummer and his Newport years.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:37.320
You were the you were the man who shared a flat with him.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:42.320
So you can opportunity for you to put the kind of record straight here.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:48.320
How did you come to meet Joe and what was the how would you describe his time?

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:54.320
He came down to Newport. He came down at the same time as me, actually, in 1971.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:21:01.320
He came down to Cardiff following a girl trying to pick up with who he'd split up with.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:06.320
And she wasn't having any of it. So he called in in Newport on his way.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:12.320
This was about September when term started, stopped off at Newport on his way back to London

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:17.320
and called in on a friend of his who he'd been in college with in London.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:22.320
And he stayed with him in North Street in Baineswell for a little while.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:32.320
And they went up to the students union and it was there that he saw, I think it was ripoff park playing in the in the hall at the back

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:38.320
and decided that he would stay and continue his kind of rock and roll journey.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:49.320
I mean, his parents, from what I remember him telling me now, had given him sort of a time off to find to find himself because he'd been to private school.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:58.320
You know, I mean, he wasn't a, you know, he'd been to public school and they would be and they were giving him a bit of slack to to find his feet.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:02.320
And he was determined to learn to play the guitar. And he wanted to become a star.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:08.320
You know, even then he was determined and he was writing stuff and he did learn to play the guitar.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:13.320
So what happened to you? Did you share a flat with each other? Is that true? And what was it like the young ones or something?

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:20.320
Entenville, yes, behind the railway station. It was it was I know it's a bit of a joke, but it was very much like the young ones.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:24.320
It was a shithole place. It was falling apart.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:31.320
We had the reel to reel tape recorder in there and he would use it a lot.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:38.320
And one of the very first songs that he wrote, Crummy Bum Blues, he recorded, we recorded on it.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:50.320
And I've still got that recording now. I only discovered it a few years ago and it was used in the film about Joe Strummer, which was made a few years ago.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:56.320
So it's on the cassette or it's on a it is on the cassette now, Alan.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:01.320
I've digitalized it as well, but it's it's on the film as well.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:05.320
I can't piece of historical archive there.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.320
Well, I see the art college. That's the other thing.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:14.320
I think it was definitely the conduit for a lot of the alternative scene that I wasn't part of.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:19.320
I was I was definitely on the straight, I think the straight and narrow.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.320
I wasn't delving into any of that side of it.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:27.320
So I think it's very creative time that the art college had a very good reputation anyway.

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:31.320
People travel for miles to be there.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:41.320
Well, the thing is, in Newport Art College, the head of the painting section was a chap called Tom Rathmell and his wife Lillian.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.320
And their daughter had married Ian Jury.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.320
Oh, right.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:52.320
And they produced Baxter and Baxter's the one who's on the front cover of New Boots and Panties.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.320
So Ian would come down.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.320
He's got his own career now.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:02.320
So his grandparents ran the art college in Newport, is that right?

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.320
Well, they were head of they were head of fine art.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.320
Wow.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:12.320
So they funny enough, they interviewed me to come to Newport Art College.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.320
I had two interviews. I had an interview in Falmouth.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.320
I didn't get it.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:22.320
And Newport was my second choice, but I was, you know, I was glad I did get it and they interviewed me.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:31.320
And then every so often, Lillian, the daughter would come down and visit the family and Ian would would come down.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.320
And of course, he wasn't a blockhead then.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:37.320
He was just he was a lecturer in an art college.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.320
They met in the Royal Academy.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:43.320
Well, see, there's a history there, isn't it?

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.320
Yeah.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.320
I don't know, was there a lot of music going on there as well?

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.320
The college, did they develop that music?

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:55.320
Yeah. Well, one of the other things that happened while I was there was that I don't know if you can remember.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.320
Do you remember the Portsmouth Symphonia?

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:06.320
Yeah. Is that the group who would get together, a collective of people who couldn't play the instruments and give them a day to learn it?

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.320
Yeah, that's it.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:14.320
They turned up one day at the art college and asked if there was a group of us who wanted to learn to play a particular piece of music badly.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:21.320
So I think about 10 or 12 of us got together and spent a whole day learning how not to play.

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.320
I had to put my finger on something and do that.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:30.320
And at the end of it, we opened the curtains on the stage during the afternoon break and played it.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.320
And I think we drove everybody out.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:42.320
But the upshot was that they recorded an album at the Albert Hall that year and we were invited up to sing in the choir and we did the Hallelujah Chorus.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:47.320
And it was on the old Grey Whistle test.

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.320
That's brilliant.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:54.320
The art college, you know, there was lots of stuff going on in the art college musically.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:26:00.320
The thing was it was very closed, you know, and it was the old union on Stowe Hill.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.320
We didn't get many. You had the Labour Club next door.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:05.320
You had the Black Clawson's at the top of the hill.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.320
And a lot of these working men clubs would have bands.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:15.320
And we seemed to have infiltrated the working man's club because the booze was cheap.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:19.320
And we would go to the Black Clawson's and they'd have a band up there.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.320
We'd go to the Labour Club on Stowe Hill.

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:25.320
I think I saw Dr John in Labour Club.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:29.320
Dr Feelgood, I think I saw on Stowe Hill as well.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:33.320
You know, there were all sorts of these bands playing in the working man's clubs.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.320
That was before the Stowe, right?

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.320
Yes.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.320
I don't know much about the hit.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.320
I mean, the Stowe was...

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.320
I remember the Stowe.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.320
I never remember the Stowe not being there.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.320
So when do you think that opened?

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.320
I know when it opened.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.320
Alan, do you know when it opened?

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.320
I don't know exactly.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:55.320
It would have been the same time as Rudy's roundabout the same time, I think.

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.320
72 or 73, was it?

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.320
No, it was a bit late.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.320
It was, well...

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:04.320
I mean, was it a disco tech that started putting on?

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.320
I've seen the list on the...

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.320
I've had a look.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.320
I was trying to find out the date that it opened.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:17.320
When it opened, I looked on the internet and it appears that on the Anarchy in the UK, the Sex Pools tour,

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:22.320
they were about the first or second band to play there.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.320
Right.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:28.320
But I thought it was something else before that.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.320
I'm kind of interested a bit in...

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.320
There used to be a club just down a bit from there called the...

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.320
What was that called, Alan?

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.320
Scamps, is it Scamps?

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.320
Yeah, that was there.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.320
Scamps was there, wasn't it?

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.320
It was a strip club, right?

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.320
It was a strip club in the basement.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.320
Oh, I don't know.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.320
At the bottom of Stale Hill.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.320
That's it.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:55.320
And then famously, and again, this is before my time, but the Alexandra opposite the Odeon.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.320
Oh yeah, I used to go there.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:03.320
Famous or infamous for having the police's first official gig, you know, Sting's.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.320
All right.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.320
They were cherry vanilla's backing band.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:11.320
And part of the deal was that they would open and that was the first date on her tour.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.320
So did you ever go to the Alex?

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.320
It wasn't known as a rock gig, as far as I can remember.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.320
No, it was rough as hell.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.320
No, I didn't go there.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.320
I did go there once.

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.320
Well, I went there more than once.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:27.320
After I left art college, I think it was about 75, I didn't know anybody really

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.320
because the students kept themselves themselves.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:35.320
Everybody went home and I was left in Newport with nobody really.

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:43.320
And I inadvertently went to the King's Hotel one night and found myself in the gay,

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:47.320
the gay center of Newport and became quite friendly with them.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:52.320
They had a great scene and they were going over to the discos in Bristol and loved it.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.320
It's a great time.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.320
But they used to go to the Alex a lot.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.320
A lot. That club you've just been talking about.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:05.320
It was through that scene, which was quite big in Newport.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:11.320
I was the sort of straight hanger on, just as I enjoyed going around there.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.320
It was good laugh.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:16.320
There was also a gay club underneath the Stowaway, wasn't it, called the Speakeasy.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.320
Do you remember that?

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.320
Yeah.

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.320
So that's where a lot of people used to go.

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.320
But there was a lot going on at the Stowaway.

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:30.320
I remember putting on some bands there on a Monday night with Mark Southall.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:35.320
You know, Mark used to run Diverse and the place in Cross Street before it.

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.320
What year were you talking about?

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.320
I'm thinking 1973, 1974, 1975, somewhere around there.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.320
He was a DJ at the time.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:46.320
So we were playing a lot of funk.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.320
There was another guy called David Bamford.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:54.320
He was another specialist DJ, you know, and they were playing lots of American funk.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:58.320
So we were doing a lot of that and I was bringing in funk bands.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:01.320
High Tension, Gonzales.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.320
I can't remember all the names, but it was quite a scene.

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.320
Yeah.

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.320
On a Monday night.

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.320
Yeah.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.320
Sounds really exciting.

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:18.320
So it's a Newport for its size, people say, has always kind of managed to have these kind of scenes, you know,

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.320
these kind of kind of cultural scenes.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.320
Yeah.

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.320
Alice from Racing Cars used to...

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.320
Ray Innis.

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:36.320
Ray Innis would drink with us all in the Oddfellas in Baineswell.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:40.320
We used to meet up in there and play darts.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:50.320
Well, the thing is I'd moved, I'd left art college and I'd bought a house in Baineswell in the mid 70s because Baineswell had been condemned.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.320
It was going to be demolished.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.320
The whole place.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.320
The whole place.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:57.320
They were going to build a road over the top and flats and shops and all sorts of stuff.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:01.320
Anyway, I bought a house in St. Mary Street for a thousand quid.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:06.320
I think it was about 1977, 1976, something like that.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:11.320
It was the Queen's Jubilee and got it for a thousand quid.

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:21.320
And we used to go over to the Stoway and I remember seeing Reckless Eric in there, Generation X, the Slips, Billy Idol.

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:25.320
Wasn't it the guy, wasn't it, what's his name, Walton was doing it?

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.320
Yeah, I think, yes.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.320
Was the promoter, wasn't he?

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.320
I think he was.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.320
Yeah, Andy Walton.

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:39.320
Yeah, and I think in 1978, the Rizzillos came down.

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:46.320
They were another punk, sorry, they're not punk really, they're kind of new wavy, but they were an art college band.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.320
There was lots of art college formed bands.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:50.320
Rizzillos were one.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:56.320
The Mekons were another one, of course, with John Langford from Newport who went to Leeds.

00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:06.320
But the Rizzillos came and played in Newport and there was a band called Ralph and the Ponytails who were from Newport and they supported the Rizzillos.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:11.320
And the Rizzillos liked them so much that they went on tour with them.

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:23.320
And it was through the tour, because the Rizzillos had played with the Mekons, that they met John Langford and John produced their first single.

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.320
That's Ralph and the Ponytails.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.320
James Bond.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:31.320
James Bond, and of course, James Bond's on both sides of the single.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.320
Inadvertently, they made a mistake.

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:37.320
So I've got a copy of that, so it's probably priceless now.

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.320
Yeah.

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:53.320
One of the things I was hoping to kind of get out of you, if possible, because obviously Alan, you left Newport and went to Los Angeles, right?

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:56.320
Yeah, well, what happened with Clobber?

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:06.320
I got out of Clobber because we had six shops and I said to the guys, look, you know, I've discovered this thing called Punk and they didn't know anything about this.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:13.320
I was so surreptitiously developing my own business there and I said, look, I'll take the shop in Bristol if you take the others.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.320
I'm happy just to have the one shop.

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.320
And they said, go ahead.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.320
And it was in the Haymarket in Bristol.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:22.320
Anyway, I developed that thing that became really popular as Paradise Garage.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:32.320
So then as the year went by, the second year, I decided to open one in Cardiff in St. Mary Street down the bottom there, which was fairly unfashionable and cheap.

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.320
The rent was cheap.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.320
And that went well.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:46.320
And we were getting a lot of bands and a lot of people from the valleys, kids buying their bondage jeans and all the stuff from Sex and London and all the stuff from Boy and the

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:50.320
Kings Road and it was just becoming quite a scene.

00:33:50.320 --> 00:34:00.320
And there were a lot of little clubs that came off that, you know, that were very influential, I think, at the time.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:09.320
And then Clive Taylor, who was the bass player with Amon Corner, was living in LA then by that time with his wife, Madeleine.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:16.320
And they came over to visit his mum in Cardiff and they came in the shop and they said, wow, this is like this would go a storm in LA.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:22.320
You must you must come over and have a look because there's so many musicians over there looking for something to wear.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.320
And there's no there's nobody selling it.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.320
So you must come and have a look.

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.320
So I went over.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:38.320
I went over with Kingsley from Rockfield and Ray Martinez, who was one of the guitar players they used on sessions there because they were promoting a new album and they wanted to get signed.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:42.320
So they went we went away and then records over there, various other places.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.320
And I stayed for a week.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:54.320
I didn't think much of it at the time, came back for about a few months and I said, this is this can't be right.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.320
There's going to be more to it than this.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:02.320
So I went back again and I stayed this time with Clive and Madeleine and we showed me around.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.320
I was blown away by it.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.320
I was blown away by it.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:12.320
And by that time, they showed me everything I needed to see really, you know, all the heritage, all the cars and Malibu beaches.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.320
It was fabulous.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:18.320
So we decided to open the shop when we opened in 1981.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.320
So that was on Melrose Avenue, which was nothing at the time.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:31.320
It was just a street full of furniture shops and second hand clothing and a couple of art varks, which was a famous record shop.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.320
And yeah, we opened in 1981.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.320
I spoke to Vivian Westwood.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.320
I said, can we use the name Let It Rock?

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.320
And she was fine about that.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:41.320
And that's what I did.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:44.320
And our first customer was the cars, a band called The Cars.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:47.320
They were knocking on the door the night before we opened the shop.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.320
They wanted to come in and see what we had.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.320
You know, it was great.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.320
You know, it was fabulous.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.320
It was a great time.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.320
Yeah.

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.320
And they went on from there.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.320
Yeah.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.320
It's such a good story.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.320
You then got into rock bands.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.320
You managed the LA Guns, right?

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.320
Yeah, from 1985, 86.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.320
And then there was the big air scene.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:15.320
That was the Sunset Strip, you know, all the glam rock bands then with Guns N' Roses and Poison and Raps and Warrens and Faster Pussycat and blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.320
Yeah, yeah.

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.320
So it's a natural development really.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:21.320
But what I found was the fashion and the music goes together, you see.

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.320
That's the whole point.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.320
And it always has, you know.

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:26.320
Unfortunately, these days it's gone.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:41.320
But, you know, since 1989 when the Manchester scene came along with the Hacienda and the Stone Roses and Happy Mondays and all that ecstasy and the E-Culture, it got rid of all that fashion, just became baggy t-shirts and baggy jeans.

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:45.320
It screwed it all up completely.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.320
I hate Manchester bands.

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.320
That's a good turn.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.320
No, I really do.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:59.320
No, but anyway, no, but in the meantime, sorry, you know, during the 70s there was stuff going on, obviously, but it was punk.

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:02.320
It was, it was, they were funk, as you say, we were doing the funk stuff.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:09.320
And then the punk, you know, they became sort of a lot of Bowie fans around at that time, late 70s.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.320
I mean, you can't really underestimate the influence of Bowie.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.320
No, absolutely.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.320
I mean, they were big followers.

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:24.320
And I tell you these people, we had Rudy's, which was a straight club and was very, like, very formal in lots of ways and very strict policy about letting people in and all that business.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:28.320
But I decided to have a go at opening a night for punks.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.320
This is right in the middle of it all, like, in 1977.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:36.320
And of course there were these gangs of kids that were coming down from Mercer on the bus.

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:41.320
And amongst them was Chris Sullivan, who became very influential and opened the Wag Club in London.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:51.320
Steve Strange, Steve Harrington from Blackwood, who was one of them was wearing, and they were all in like bin liners and with chains going through their noses, you know, bright yellow hair.

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:58.320
It was like, it was like something out of another planet, you know, people that were caught on to it.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.320
I mean, they were shocked by it.

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.320
They were really shocked by it.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:07.320
But a lot of them came from the valleys, you know, down to Newport.

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.320
And that created that bit of a fashion scene.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:12.320
And they used to go to Rudy's.

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:21.320
There was Baker's Row, which was in John Frost Square, which was another, which is, there was one in Cardiff, but this Baker's Row was opened up as a disco.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.320
So they used to go there.

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:32.320
Newport, as long as I can remember, has always had sort of a reputation for kind of violence, or at least as a tough turn to put it.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.320
It was a hard town.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:38.320
Was it like that? Was it just worse then?

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:45.320
No, I think as these guys kept themselves themselves and they were team-handed, you know, so I don't think people, I think they just moved around.

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:48.320
I don't remember them getting into much trouble.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.320
I just think that they were, they were a lot on them.

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.320
Yeah, and pretty tough themselves, I would imagine.

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:58.320
Yeah, they were from, believe me, they were tough.

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:03.320
They're not tough to look at, but you know, they were, you wouldn't want to mess around with them at all.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.320
But it was a lot of fun that.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:09.320
Then Steve went up to live in London and opened the Blets Club and all that stuff.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:13.320
What were you doing, Rich, around about the late 70s?

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:23.320
Well, as I said, 77 was really when the, that was the White Riot tour, when that happened in 77.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:31.320
And Mick Foote was in a shared a studio in Newport Art College with Alan Jones.

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.320
Oh, another Alan Jones. Good God.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:37.320
Alan Jones, who went on to become the editor of Melody Maker and Uncut.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.320
Oh, really?

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.320
So those two shared a studio.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:51.320
Now, what happened was that in Mick's third year, when he was writing his dissertation or tried to write his dissertation, he was writing on rock music.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:40:01.320
Well, Woody, Joe Strummer, had left Pentonville, the flat, and had moved in in Clifford Crescent with Mick and his girlfriend.

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:08.320
And so in order to not pay rent, he wrote Mick's dissertation for him.

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:12.320
So Woody wrote Mick Foote's dissertation.

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:24.320
At the end of that term, Joe went back up to London and Mick went back up to London, and he became a squatter in 101 somewhere or other, and they formed the 101ers.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:29.320
And Mick got kind of embroiled in it all and ended up being the sound man.

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:38.320
And so they were doing this UK tour now, the White Riot tour, and they were playing in the Union in Cardiff.

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:48.320
So I went over to see them and as I said, Mick was doing the sound and they, Joe had given me his ukulele.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:41:01.320
He left his ukulele in Newport when he went back to London and he asked me to bring it over to Bristol, where they were playing the following day in the exhibition centre on the riverfront.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:06.320
So anyway, I went over the next day, but luckily I forgot to take the ukulele.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:11.320
And when he shouted at me during the soundcheck, where's my fucking guitar frame?

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:16.320
I forgot. He said, oh, you may as well keep it. It was bloody useless anyway, because there was no string on it.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:26.320
So I got to keep it. But I stayed with him on a couple of the gigs and acted as the bloke who looked after the bouncers, which was an experience.

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:34.320
I wouldn't mind kind of trying to draw some memories at you guys.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:39.320
We've spoken a bit about fashion and quite a lot about music.

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:54.320
What do you remember of kind of what it was like just to live at that time in Newport, you know, which is a working class town, steel town, I guess it was then kind of defined by Lam-Wurn.

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.320
Would you say that? Yeah, definitely.

00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.320
I mean, but, you know, I remember it's a thriving town.

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:09.320
It was, you know, the street was busy, commercial street was busy, you know, lots of shops, you know, a lot of activity, lots of pubs.

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:12.320
I kind of thought it was pretty cool. It was all right. I didn't have a problem.

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:17.320
No boarded up. No boarded up. No, no, not like now. No, no, no, not at all.

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:22.320
No, absolutely. I mean, my dad was involved with, you know, retail on the street.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:26.320
He was in London House, which is a big department store there.

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:39.320
I remember that growing up when he was, you know, I used to go there and wrap presents at Christmas time for the punters, you know, but and then he had a drapery shop on commercial street called Phillips and Hamley.

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:45.320
I just remember it has been, yeah, a busy town, you know, good stuff.

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:52.320
Lots of nice people. I don't remember a lot of aggravation really, I have to say.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.320
I never got bothered that much.

00:42:55.320 --> 00:43:04.320
I was going to say, when I arrived, I had to spend my first few weeks down in Bolt Street.

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:12.320
And I'd lived in Cardiff before anyways, and I'd gone down Tiger Bay a lot as a student in foundation.

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:23.320
So there were a lot of similarities between pill and Tiger Bay. But the one thing that was noticeable down there that the whole place was being about to be demolished.

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:29.320
And there was this absolute sense of total misery and depression.

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:40.320
It was the saddest place that I'd ever been to. There were people hanging around on street corners because the roads, the roads of houses have been boarded up.

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:46.320
And they'd been shunted out by the council to sort of stay in temporary places up in Bettis and places like that.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:58.320
And they just kept returning and there was gangs of people stood on street corners. And it was very sad, you know, they opened the pill advice centre and it was run by a bloke called Cliff Knight, who went on to write lots of books about pill.

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:06.320
And he was a wonderful man. And they used to go in there for solace more than anything else and he used to comfort them because it was such a massive upheaval.

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:16.320
So Newport was going through this big change really. They were trying to sweep aside the corn exchange. A lovely building was being demolished.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:25.320
I remember it was opposite the King's Head Hotel and I just couldn't understand why they were demolished. It was this fantastic building with a lovely clock front.

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:38.320
So funny enough, I thought it was quite depressing actually at the time. You're right, the high street was thriving. There was a fantastic market. The market was great.

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:49.320
I used to have a stall upstairs in the market selling art and I had a badge making business and I would make all the badges by hand.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:45:01.320
And I made all the badges for Tizwas when that started. I jokingly sent off a couple of badges for Spit the Dog and the next programme they were all wearing them.

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:11.320
I used to get orders in. In fact, I'm wearing a badge now. In fact, this badge here is, I think Richard got one of these, it's for the photographs of Joe Stromer at the small cemetery.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:24.320
But I made all the badges for the prizes for Tizwas and we had a lovely stall up there. It was a great sense of community. Every Saturday the upstairs was open. It was packed up there.

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:29.320
And the market at Crispa was wonderful. It was lovely.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:36.320
In those days, before streaming and computers, you had cinemas, two channels on the TV.

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:49.320
Anything that you can think of? It doesn't really matter how off the wall it is that you might want to talk about.

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:53.320
What was the first IRA event at that time? Any kind of events?

00:45:53.320 --> 00:46:02.320
Well, in London, the first IRA bombs were going off and I was working as a student up in London during the summer holidays.

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:13.320
And while I was working up there on one occasion, the bombs went off in the Tower of London. And on the day that I was working and I was drinking in an Irish bar in Piccadilly Circus at the time.

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:23.320
And they rounded up loads of people. But in the art college, we used to invite a speaker along every month to talk about various things.

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:35.320
And we ended up one month getting somebody from the IRA came and spoke about things. And it's a slight different perspective on their point of view.

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:47.320
And I actually became quite friendly with this. He was a young lad, nice young lad, who was their man in Newport.

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:53.320
And he used to hang around with our students. I mean, not quite sure what he was up to.

00:46:53.320 --> 00:47:01.320
But I mean, you know, there's a big Irish population in Newport, of course, second generation, third generation, some of them.

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:14.320
You know, there was a lot of that. And of course, there was that bomb that went off in Newport in Gorey, which nobody was really sure whether it was just an accident that somebody had left the bomb in a case there and had to skedaddle or something.

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:21.320
And it went off. Could you accidentally leave a bomb? Well, a police may have turned up and he may have ran. Nobody really knows.

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:29.320
Bomber Charles Street, am I right? Yes. Opposite Lloyds Bank, just slightly over to the left of Lloyds of the bank.

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:37.320
It went off just before the pubs emptied. If it had gone off a little bit later, there would have probably been a hell of a lot of injuries.

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:50.320
And I think there was somebody who was found dead a few days later, if I remember, suspected bomber, but they could never connect the two.

00:47:52.320 --> 00:48:00.320
Do you remember the silver Jubilee in Newport, Alan? 1977.

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:16.320
Okay, yeah, go on. Yeah. In Baineswell, we had a carnival and we painted all the herbs, red, white and blue and we had pram races and it was a great carnival for Baineswell because that was in 77.

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:21.320
And when the carnival was on its knees, Baineswell had now been given a new lease of life.

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:35.320
Although I bought my house being told it was going to be demolished, they'd given us the all clear after about a year saying, you know, we're not knocking them down after all now so you can stay there, which was fantastic, you know.

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:39.320
So it was just a big celebration, the Baineswell carnival.

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:44.320
I'm not sure now if there would be street parties for a royal celebration, what do you think?

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:46.320
Probably not.

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:50.320
You know, times have changed.

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:53.320
Exactly. Yeah, yeah, indeed.

00:48:53.320 --> 00:49:00.320
I've remembered now how it was that Alan and I met. It was through Alexander Cordell, of course.

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:12.320
Of course, Alexander Cordell wrote Rape of the Fair Country in 1959 and Alan met him, I would have thought, during the 70s.

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:15.320
Hang on, let's think about this.

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:19.320
No, I got in touch with John Barnes.

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:21.320
That's right.

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:30.320
About this, about this story and about what was happening with it, and I got a letter back from him that was in the late 60s.

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:39.320
When I was in London, I read the book and I was very, I was taken with it and I decided in grandiose idea that we should do a film.

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:41.320
What do you think about it now?

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:48.320
And I contacted John Barnes who lives in New Jersey, who had the rights to the books.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:50:03.320
And that was the first time, but I never met Alex until 81 or 82 when my wife to be came over and she fell down the stairs and went home.

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:09.320
And we couldn't go back to the States so she spent the fortnight on her back, basically reading the book.

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:16.320
And we got it and we decided to go and get in touch with him and we went to stay with him and it was the Isle of Man.

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:18.320
We flew up to the Isle of Man to see him.

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:21.320
And I saw him again in Wrexham.

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:25.320
So that was then, that was early 80s.

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:42.320
Yeah, because that when his book was published when when I came down to Wales in 66 I was told to read it by my history teacher and then of course, moving to Newport in 1972 was absolutely fantastic because you know here I was at the Westgate Hotel with Bullitt Halls.

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.320
Of course.

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:49.320
But also I was very friendly with the band called Budgie. Oh yeah.

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:53.320
I used to do the road in for them.

00:50:53.320 --> 00:51:07.320
And Ray, exactly Burke, and we went on one occasion I remember playing in Blenavon in some working man's club, which was opposite, not the pit the fine works.

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:09.320
I read the book.

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:27.320
I went over to the ironworks and of course it had to hadn't got old of it by then and it was just this derelict depressing sort of site and you could wander around it imagining the words I could hear this Alex's writing was so colorful as you know, you know, it was fantastic

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:32.320
to go and see and because we both got to know Alex well.

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:48.320
I know some people won't know who Alexander Cordell is so do you want to do a brief introduction about who Alexander Cordell is in the book itself. Alexander Cordell was a writer who wrote a book called Rape of the Fair Country which was published in 1959, and it tells the story

00:51:48.320 --> 00:52:04.320
of a Welsh iron family who live in Blenavon, who get involved in Chartism, who marched down on that fateful night in 1839 to the battle that takes place outside the Westgate Hotel.

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:23.320
And it tells the story is the story of the family and the conditions in which they lived in and Alex felt very strongly about the working environment in which those working class people struggled to live during the 19th century and it's a fantastic story.

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:36.320
And I think it deserves a reissue at some point. It's been out of fashion for a while but it was always such a classic.

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:50.320
Yeah, true. And then he wrote like a trilogy, didn't he, of the three hosts of Rebecca and Sweden Bitter Earth, was it? Yeah, it's brilliant anyway, brilliant writer.

00:52:54.320 --> 00:53:07.320
I remember going to Rockfield a lot in those days, in the 70s, 74 actually made a single in that, you know, and there was a lot going on there, which kind of put the area on the map, if you like.

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:14.320
It always adds a bit of history and a bit of a reputation for all the top bands playing there. Yeah, I guess it had to come to Newport.

00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:23.320
I think they used to come into Newport for a drink and all that stuff. They always have actually, because Newport is the nearest place that you'd probably pick.

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:38.320
Yeah, well it's the nearest train station. Yeah, somebody told me once, David Bowie at Newport train station in the 80s. I think he's been, I'm pretty sure it's true, he'd been out to Rockfield because Iggy Pop was recording that day, you know.

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:55.320
And he was just on his own on the platform there. One of the things we haven't mentioned is, you know, obviously TJ's, but when, because Johnny, when he first started in Clarence Place, he had that cafe or restaurant called The Cedars.

00:53:55.320 --> 00:54:14.320
That was his first, which he opened with his wife. And at some point, I can't remember, it was in the mid 70s, early 70s, he came up to the Students' Union because he was looking to sort of develop and expand his kind of little empire down there in Clarence Place, because he acquired the building next door.

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:27.320
And, you know, and what he was looking for was customers and who was, who was his customers going to be and he thought he was going to hijack the students from the Union. I remember him coming up there, I was social secretary.

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:41.320
And he, he wanted me, he wanted me to show him around. And so I showed him around and it was an absolute dump of a place. So he obviously, you know, was impressed and recreated the same sort of dump that we had up on Stonehill.

00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:44.320
The Union, because they opened it.

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:53.320
Talking about dumps, a place we haven't mentioned yet is the Emlin Street Student Union, right? Do you remember that?

00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:57.320
Oh, that came way after, that came after Stonehill.

00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:02.320
Yeah, they closed down on Stonehill and that one came next.

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:15.320
So Emlin Street was a Students' Union which was by, where the Newport Centre is now, not far from the riverfront. And that was, they used to have bands there, but did you not?

00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:17.320
No, I'd left by then.

00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:18.320
Okay.

00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:22.320
That's when I started going.

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:29.320
Just out of interest, when was, when did John start putting bands on in the TJs?

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:30.320
When was that?

00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:45.320
I can tell you what I think, I mean, Richard might go back further than me, but I can remember, one of the things people misremember about TJs in my opinion, I'm in my late 50s, one of the things people don't

00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:58.320
misremember is basically, you know, if you're in a, like I was in, I was in bands, is that, is that TJs was quite, could be quite a scary place, you know, it's got this reputation

00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:09.320
a proper reputation, deserved reputation for being a great rock and roll club, but actually back in the early 80s, it was quite, it could be quite scary, you know, quite frightening.

00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:16.320
And it's the sort of place that you could, you wouldn't want to go, you know, and you get some right characters in there, you know.

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:24.320
And I've seen some, I've seen some really, I've seen some bad violence in there which was quite, quite frightening in my time.

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:33.320
Richard, but John would always give you a chance to like, nobody, you know, you could be a band mate, nobody would give you a gig, nobody would pay you, you could take the John, or can we just set up and play,

00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:41.320
mates will come, you know, we'll take 50p on the door and at least they're going to buy cans off you, you know.

00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:57.320
So that was the kind of thing with TJs is that I think almost, almost by accident it became this great rock and roll venue, because other places in Newport wouldn't put these bands on, you know, because they were, these bands were quite, a lot of drugs.

00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:59.320
Radical. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:07.320
I don't know, I remember seeing the Darling Buds in there in

00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:14.320
1889, I don't remember much from then, I don't know if Richard does.

00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:28.320
No, that'd be about right. It might be a good idea to ask Simon when they, when he first started, he used to put on a lot of the gigs, because I can't be, I can't remember, I know we used to go there when I just left art college.

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:39.320
Simon was putting gigs on other places, he was putting gigs on Stoweville Labour Club, and he was putting them on in Pille, in the Irish Club. He wasn't always, you know, TJs wasn't the first.

00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:42.320
That's what I mean about people misremembering.

00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:51.320
It became this great place, but actually, people tried to go anywhere but TJs at the beginning.

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:52.320
Fair enough.

00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:53.320
Fair enough.

00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:55.320
Secoes as we call it, TJs.

00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:57.320
Secoes, yeah.

00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:11.320
Yeah, because Simon put on the, what was called the Party in the Park, and that was, with the Damned. Yeah, that was a fundraising event for us, for our homelessness organisation.

00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:21.320
I did it with him and John, so Cola, and we had the Damned there and Selecta, and it was Skin Dread's first gig.

00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:23.320
That's when they played the band.

00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:32.320
But it was great meeting the Damned, because obviously, you know, they were the ones who came out with the first punk single, really.

00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:38.320
So it was great having them here.

00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:46.320
If you've got any kind of thoughts on how Newport has kind of maybe changed from those early days, the early 70s, then where's it going, do you think?

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:53.320
I just think the soul's been taken out of it, you know, by business, the economy has screwed it up.

00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:58.320
And I don't think they've put enough money into redeveloping...

00:58:58.320 --> 00:58:59.320
Local politicians?

00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:03.320
Yeah, probably the council. I don't know much, I don't follow it very much.

00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:14.320
I'm constantly disappointed about the way the town is being treated, and it seems there's been a lot of mismanagement around the place.

00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:17.320
Oh, I'm not so despondent, actually.

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:19.320
No, I'm the other way.

00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:27.320
I think the High Street, now, I mean, we know that the chap who runs the...

00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:35.320
Oh, the Antiques place in Panarth Road, and also the Tram Shed in Cardiff has now redeveloped Newport Market.

00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:39.320
And that's been turned into a sort of food venue offices and all sorts of things.

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:45.320
The High Street and the market arcade up the top, you know, there's a lot of money gone into that.

00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:52.320
New shops and things like that are going to be open soon. So that top end of town, you've got to start somewhere.

00:59:52.320 --> 01:00:00.320
No, the top end of town. Yeah, yeah, no, I agree. But commercial street, commercial street, the main street, you know.

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:12.320
Yeah, I was kind of thinking about, I was a child in the 70s, and I remember it being extremely busy and those double-decker buses going through before they paved it over, you know.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:29.320
Unfortunately, Newport didn't get shortlisted to the City of Culture, but I think what it's done, it's given it a kind of a, I wouldn't say a bit of a boost, really, because in order to submit that application, they had to do a joint bid between the other local authorities in Southeast Wales.

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:38.320
And I think now what they're going to do is join up together to say, we've got a great product down here in Southeast Wales, you know, come and visit us.

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:49.320
And I think they're going to work together better, hopefully, so that they will be able to win that on the next time around.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:52.320
Work together better, is that your phrase?

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:56.320
Well, I hope they will, you know, I just hope they will.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:02.320
I'm pleased there's some, you know, progress being made. I didn't know, I wasn't aware of all that stuff. I'm kind of...

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:06.320
A sad thing is the demise of a decent local newspaper.

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:07.320
Yeah.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:20.320
You know, back in the early 70s, you had a music correspondent, you had a police reporter, you had a reporter for practically everything you could possibly think of. It was a decent sized newspaper.

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:35.320
And now you've got about two or three reporters who cover everything, who never leave the office, who don't go out and speak to people, who don't get to know the people, don't feel the pulse of what's going on.

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:46.320
We've lost a good newspaper. It's really... and we've seen that over the last few decades, certainly since I've been here, I've noticed that.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:52.320
But that's got to be the internet, right? People are not buying newspapers like they did.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:54.320
Very sad.
