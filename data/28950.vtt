Cliff Cottage

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.080
Cliff Cottage was donated to the parish of Lalliston in 1910 by Miss Sarah Ann Blandy of Broadlands.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.800
The cottage was intended to be a reading room and general meeting place for the parishioners,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.440
a kind of workman's club and institute.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.400
Its upkeep was provided by the formation of the Blandy Trust and the rent from accommodation.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.080
In the First World War, it was inhabited by Belgian refugees, and for a short time after that,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.800
it was the headquarters of the Air Rifle Club, but by the 1950s, the buildings and gardens had

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.560
fallen into disrepair. In 1968, there was a proposal to convert the house into a parish hall,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.000
but the cost would be too high. In 1971, the gardening club agreed to take over the cottage

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.160
and carry out the necessary repair work to the building on the understanding they would not be

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.360
charged rent. They are still located there to this day. There is a small room at the side of the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.680
cottage called Blandy Hall, which is used by the Community Council, other groups such as

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.720
Writers' Circles and the Ramblers use it for meetings as well.
