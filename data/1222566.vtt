00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880
I mean in my father's time there was anti-Semitism without a doubt because

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.640
and there are streets in Swansea where well Jewish people started off at the

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:18.880
slaughterhouse right which was smelly so that was the cheap housing and they

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:25.920
lived there and most of my family lived there and then as they got better you

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.760
could see the progression coming off the hill one side of the hill was Jewish

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.480
the other side was Green Hill which was the Catholics where the Catholic

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.080
Cathedral is St. Joseph right they've come down the hill and they came to

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.120
Mansel Street which was where my grandfather had right and they had

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:50.600
houses you know families had houses right and then they gradually moved west

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.840
which was Uplands, Skeetie and some in Gower but you could see the progression

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.160
of wealth and standing within the communities you know so now most of our

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:13.360
what's left are west of Swansea there's nobody that lives east of the river
