00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So tell me about your National Series.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Yes, well, you had the option. When you were called up, you went for an interview.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So the first thing you did was you made out all your terrible illnesses and complaints.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You emphasised all these in the hope that you would be declared not fit enough to go.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But the fact that I did faint at the sight of blood and various other things, they said,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
OK, we'll class you as Grade 2, but we're taking Grade 2s.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So which branch of the service do you want to go into?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So I plumped for the Royal Air Force and they said with my background they would take me in the Air Force.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So about three weeks later you get the dreaded letter with a railway voucher telling you to report to RAF Cardington,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
which is near Bedford, and make your own way there, which is what I did.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I got on the train and I ended up in the old airship facility, which is RAF Cardington,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
which was where they kept and built the airships.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And the hangars were now being used to fit you out with your uniforms and everything else.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And then you were there for three days and then you were allocated to a basic training camp.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And the one I was allocated to was RAF Bridgnorth, which is in Shropshire.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So I didn't find that very arduous at all because having spent six years in a British public school,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
going into the Army is relatively easy.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And I'd also been in the cadet force there, so I knew how to march, I knew how to carry a rifle,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000
how to slope arms, how to order arms, how to strip a Bren gun, all that sort of thing was all very familiar to me.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So I really had no problem with basic training.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Then after eight weeks you're given a weekend pass and you're sent home

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and then told to report for your trade training after that training.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
You're given the choice of where they will take you.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And my first choice was photography because that was my hobby.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So before they would take you on the photography course, they sent you off to do a test.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Now I think they didn't really want National Servicemen on the photography department

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
because that was one of the better trades to go into.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And they really kept it for the people who'd signed on for three years or longer.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
But it was a rule that if a National Serviceman says he wants to do it, he should be allowed to take the test.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Now what they didn't tell me in the test was what they were looking for.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
They gave me a series of negatives, put me into the darkroom and said,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
well there you are, get on with it, print these negatives for us.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
So I did as best I could. I knew how to develop and print things.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And of course what they were really looking for was beautifully, how shall I say,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
balance negatives all the same with the same level of black and white.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Because obviously these are photographs taken from a plane.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
When they're all joined together on a table, they need to look like one.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Well of course mine, some were lighter, some were darker, and they looked like terrible patchwork.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So they said, well I'm sorry you failed.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
But of course if they told me that I need to get them all the same, I could have made more effort.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
But I didn't. So that was that. So the next option was radio.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So I did quite well in physics in school and I did in university.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And I liked electrical engineering so I said, well I want to become a radio fitter.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
So fair enough. The course was nine months long.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
It was in RAF Compton, Bassett, which is near Caen in Wiltshire.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And so I went off there for nine months and I quite enjoyed that.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Because of what I'd done in university I didn't find it particularly difficult.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And I passed that course and I came out as a junior technician,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
which is you get one upside down stripe on your arm.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And then because I wanted to sit my university exams again I'd applied for a home posting.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So that was granted and my posting came through when I was posted to Gloucester, RAF Innsworth.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Now by this time I was engaged to Jill and Jill had got herself a job in Gloucester at the art college.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So I thought, ah, heaven, here we are. I'll be in the RAF Innsworth and we'll be together again.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.000
So I marched in through the gate at RAF Innsworth and the chap who was on guard there took one look at my papers

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and he said, oh, he said, you're posted to 15 Squadron RAF Regiment.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
He said, they're in Northern Ireland. You'll be off tomorrow.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
So I had one night in Gloucester, said goodbye to Jill.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And the next day I was on the trek to Northern Ireland, to Londonderry.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And that is where I spent the rest of the time, all except for the last two months when the whole regiment was transferred to Felixstowe.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And then I went to Felixstowe and in Felixstowe I was demobbed and then I came back and that was my two years national service.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
But I never really regretted it. I know it was a waste of two years,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000
but during that period I grew up and you go in a boy and you come out a man, which is pretty true.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And I learned quite a lot. I never really managed to learn how to fix the radios because they were so old and they didn't work anyway.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And I couldn't get them to work. And it didn't seem to bother the RAF Regiment at all.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000
They didn't need it. They were guarding the airfield. The troubles with the IRA hadn't really started in those days.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
They were just rumblings and we had to go out and guard various radio masts.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000
They gave us a rifle, but they didn't give us any bullets. So I don't know what good the rifle was.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And our joke was if we have to challenge someone and have to shoot him, well, we have to make a loud bang because that's all we could do or club him with a rifle.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.000
It wasn't taken very seriously. And we got on well enough with the locals. All this business of the troubles hadn't taken off.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Some of the boys went out with the local girls.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
This was what, 1956, 1958?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Yes, yes. I mean the trouble started in the 70s didn't it?
