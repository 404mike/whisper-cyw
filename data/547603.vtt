For who that waits so rich and free?

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:24.160
Till now thou cometh o'er my mind,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:34.160
Come then, O beautiful crown of light,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:42.160
On to the grass with the red hue,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:52.160
Now all thy faith I know no more.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:02:01.160
Now all thy faith I know no more.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.160
I will sing of thy elderly,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:14.160
And from thy home therefore I live.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:23.160
And from thy home therefore I live.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:32.160
O is the song thy song will,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:42.160
Of clear skies, cloudy and marvellous hill,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:50.160
Fallen with thy archives adorned,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:03:00.160
In their o'er-threats happy and calm.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:09.160
In their o'er-threats happy and calm.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.160
I will sing of thy elderly,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:22.160
And from thy home therefore I live.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:29.160
And from thy home therefore I live.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:40.160
O may this rage, this passion's grace,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:49.160
This God-like miracle of love,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:57.160
Fill thy whole earth with grateful praise,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:07.160
And all the earth's hell inquires upon.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:16.160
And all the earth's hell inquires upon.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:23.160
Who is a farming God like thee?

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.160
Who has grace so rich and free?

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:38.160
Who is a farming God like thee?

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.160
Who is a farming God like thee?

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.160
Who has grace so rich and free?

Who has grace so rich and free?
