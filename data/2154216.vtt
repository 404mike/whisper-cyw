00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What did you want to have?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.280
No, this will just go for captions for photos and things.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.280
Yes, that's right.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.280
Where was that photo during the year?

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.880
At Dalgael and Otho.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.280
That's where they farmed then, you see, yes.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.280
So that's my mother-in-law, Bessie.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.280
Right.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.280
And that's Penry that went to Devon-Eithen after, and that's Reg, Price, that was at

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.280
Devon-Eithen.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.280
I see.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.280
We saw them here, and you see, we saw them.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.280
That's a lovely photo.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.560
There's Penry and Reg then, you see, when my mother-in-law isn't on that then, you see.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.880
So yes, that's it, yes.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.880
That's where they farmed.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.360
It was on the Glenrose estate, but then that was sold in 1930.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.680
31, I think, so Devon-Eithen's bought.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.160
They didn't want to buy that.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.360
They wanted a bigger farm, so they bought Devon-Eithen.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.360
Yes, that's right, yes.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.360
This is coming from Annan.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.360
Yes, that's right, yes.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.440
Well, that's your stomping ground, I suppose.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.440
Well, they moved over there, yes.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.440
I went over there when Maggie had an accident, Reg's wife.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.440
I went over there once a week for, I don't know, how many weeks to make butter.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.440
My word.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.440
You're helpful, then.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.440
Yeah, that's right, yes.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.440
So, oh, these are the Reese's.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.440
Yes, from the Ronan, those are, yes.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.440
So, yes.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.440
No, the Ronan, that's on the Glen, isn't it?

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.520
Yes, that's right.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.520
Yes, that's right.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.520
Oh, here's another one of Devon-Eithen.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.520
That's Reggie Penry and Grandma, and that's Gertie and George.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.520
I'm afraid, well, you see, Gertie was a sister to them, and she came to help to look after

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.520
Grandma.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.520
She lived up in, well, Port Maddock originally, but then, well, yes, she died in Port Maddock,

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.520
but they went to live in Crewe afterwards.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.520
But she came, and that was her husband.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.600
So, he was a train driver.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.600
He was getting, there was only one person getting more money than him, and that was

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.600
the bank manager in Port Maddock at that time.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.600
So, yes, I heard them saying that.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.600
So, yes, so, and, oh, here they are outside again.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:21.600
Oh, there is my mother-in-law there now, outside Devon-Eithen with Grandma, and then that's

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.600
Marjorie, my sister-in-law.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.680
Like her daughter, yes, that's right, three generations there.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.680
The dresses, yes, amazing.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.680
That's right, yes, so, that's right, yes.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.680
All from the collection of Arthur Price Ashfield.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.680
That's what you did, wasn't it?

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.680
You literally farmed Ashfield, didn't you?

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.680
Yes, yes, yes.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.680
Oh, that's right, oh, I don't know, there's no reason.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.680
Home guard, yes.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.680
I don't know, my husband was in the home guard, but whether that was, what is this,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.680
whether he'd be in there or not, I don't know.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.680
Probably a few people you know.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.680
Well, this is a good many years ago, mind.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.680
Yes, of course, we're going back a bit, aren't we?

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.680
Yes, yes.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.680
Oh, this is a confirmation, confirmation, yes.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.680
Yes, yes, that's right, yes.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.680
What's his name, Martin Jones?

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.680
No, no, I don't know.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.680
Oh, Gladys Ingram O'Connor, I knew her.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.680
Amy Ingram, yes.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.680
Oh, Lennie Evans, Lennie Christ, support.
