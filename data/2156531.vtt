WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.700
Yes, we're ready to go now. Today is Friday the 23rd of September. My name is Jill Willie

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:22.400
and I'm at Habit Hardware talking to Mr John Jones, who has lived in this area all his

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.760
life. John, thank you very much for agreeing to have a chat with me. First of all, could

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.160
you just start with your year of birth, John, please? I was born on the 2nd of February, 1948.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:44.640
And can you tell me where you were born? I was born in a bedroom at Upper Llanfadog. Can you tell

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.560
me exactly where Upper Llanfadog or Llanfadog Ichavis then, John? Well, as you go from Raider

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:58.920
up the Allen Valley, you go past the Allen Valley Hotel and it's the next farm on your right,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:07.440
about 300 yards away. Thank you. And what sort of facilities do you remember as you were growing

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.360
up? Things like running water and etc. Can you give me some details of that sort of thing? Well,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:25.200
we had no electricity. The toilet was outside, about 50 yards away, and the water we had from

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:36.520
the spout. And my mother did all the washing and that out there by the brook. And a tin

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:45.800
bath brought into the back kitchen, perhaps twice a week, sometimes only once a week. And no

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:54.480
electricity, so we had these paraffin lamps that you had to pump up all the time when the pressure

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:03.720
dropped. I see. And how much work did you yourself do around the farm, John, as a young boy growing

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:14.580
up? I did quite a bit. When I attended Allen Village School, I used to milk a cow every morning

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.880
by hand because we sold milk round the Elan Village and that was my contribution. I milked

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:29.680
this one cow, who was my favourite, perched on a little stool and then I walked to the school

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:38.840
afterwards. And you actually got your water from where exactly, John? Well, between the house and

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:46.280
building at Llanfadog, there was a brook coming down and we had a spout and a little pool there

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:54.160
and that is where the water came from. But when I was about 10, we had it piped about 500 yards

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:02.280
from another well out in the field and that was wonderful spring water. And the only time I saw

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:14.320
that goat rye was in the hot summer of 1976. Indeed. And were your family born at and grew up in

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:24.040
Llanfadog up here? My father was born there and my mother was born at the Gunfant Laniere. Now,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:34.400
what, we were a large family, John, in Llanfadog? Yes, we were. I was the fourth but there was a

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:45.680
baby loss between me and the sister above me. So we were five really and so there was five of us.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:56.280
But I was born a long time after. My two older sisters was 22 and 20 when I was born and two

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.360
of my three sisters were married with children. So I have nephews and nieces older than myself.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:13.280
That's quite unusual but of course it does happen. What sort of major events can you remember in the

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:20.120
Ellen Valley as you were growing up, John? Well, I suppose the first one was when the Queen came

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:28.000
with the Duke of Edinburgh in October 1952. I would have been four-year-old and I just remember

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:37.240
standing outside the hotel over on where the bicycle path is now with our flags and my sister,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:44.160
Joan, was a waitress in the Ellen Valley and she waited on the Queen. Oh, what an accolade,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:53.920
my word. And what places did you have to play in and to generally just explore in your Ellen

00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:01.440
Valley area? On the farm. You had plenty of places. You had fields all around you but I think me and

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.280
my nephews enjoyed going down the brook to where it meets the River Ellen and we were catching

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:14.600
minnows there until I was old enough to have a rod and line and I loved fishing in those days.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:21.760
Quite a lot of that goes on at the Ellen Valley, doesn't it? Right, now what memories do you have

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:29.760
of the big shearings that took place in the Ellen Valley, John? Oh, well, it was the highlight of

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:39.000
the year. You swap men with neighbouring farms so, you know, there might be thirty men would come to

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:48.200
your shearing and it was the day of the year. You started off with breakfast and then you had lunch

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:55.960
and tea and hopefully you finished about five o'clock. And we had one hill which was up above

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:04.200
the Clarewyn Dam so them sheep had to be driven down on a two-day drive sort of thing to shear at

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:11.080
Uppel and Vaddard and then that night they were taken back up to the hen run and they went on from

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:19.960
there back to the hill next day. And shearing was a wonderful thing. As a boy the highlight was after

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:28.440
dinner we'd have a game of football with all the younger men but what I remember there was four or

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:36.120
five old men sat outside the barn on a bench all day and all they were sitting down and talking

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:43.960
about tales and they seemed very old to me but when I think back they were probably only in their

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:52.440
late 60s, you know, but the way they dressed and that I thought they were a hundred. But I'm sure

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:59.320
they had lots of interesting memories to share. Yes. So would you say that despite the rural locality

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:06.280
you had plenty to do and a very good social life you knew everyone? Oh yes I knew everyone

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:14.600
and as I've got two nephews living behind the Ellen Valley Hotel the three of us sort of

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:22.760
played together most nights and played football in the field at Llanwaddug and later on when

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:30.280
Birmingham City police cadets came to Ellen Village they had goal posts put up on the green

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:37.560
so we used to go up there to play football and I've seen us cycle down to Llanwathal to play

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:47.160
Boys of Llanwathal and everywhere we went we cycled and I was a founder member of Raider

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:55.480
Young Farmers and that started in 1963 and still we were old enough to drive

00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:02.120
we went there on a push bike which was up in Bryntirion then they held their meetings.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.120
And Bryntirion I understand is the then secondary school of the area, is that correct? Yes it was.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:16.200
The only time I ever attended Bryntirion was to try my 11 plus.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:25.800
Right we'll come on to that now then on to school life. Can you tell me

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.480
where you went to school and what age you were when you started John?

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:37.320
I went to Ellen Village Primary School at Easter 1953.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:47.720
My birthday was February so I had just gone five and my sister Joan took me to school the first

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:56.280
morning and all the other pupils were stood in the entrance I think waiting the newcomer and

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:05.800
I was there till 1959 and I had many a happy time looking back in the Valley School.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:12.760
We were never more than 20 pupils and I think when I left they were down to 12

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:21.240
and there was two teachers there the first teacher was Mrs. Jim Price or Mrs. Betty Price

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.520
and the senior teacher was Miss Chu.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.600
I have heard those names.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:35.880
Could I add one more thing? Please. The only thing I hated about the

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:44.120
Ellen Valley School every June the Lord Mayor of Birmingham came down and we had the June tea

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:51.320
and of course the tea was nice I loved that but afterwards we had to perform on stage

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:58.520
and every year they seemed to have me to sing a solo and after that the Lady Mayoress presented

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:05.320
us all with a book for what we'd done during the year if you've done well you have the best books.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:15.240
Right and am I right in thinking that the school at the Ellen Village was where the lodge is now?

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:25.880
Yes it was there was a school immediately above it when the works were going on but this new

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:35.720
school was built in 1909 and my mother went to the old school just above it but my father

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:43.720
was not allowed to go to that school because he was living in the Radnyshire side and he had to

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:52.200
walk three miles to come tie the school every day. So you yourself went to the Ellen Village

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:59.160
School but you were still in what was then Radnyshire weren't you so were there many other

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:07.160
children from Radnyshire in that school? No I think at the time I left there was just two of us

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:15.160
the other boy didn't try the 11 plus so he went straight to Brinturion there was three the same

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:23.000
age as me living on the Breckinshire side so they went to Bilth High School and they didn't have to

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:30.360
try the 11 plus I was the only one out of the five of us that had to try the 11 plus. And was that

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:36.520
because Radnyshire and Breckinshire being different authorities had decided different rules regarding

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:44.600
the 11 plus? Yes it has I mean it's different now you can go to any school but in them days it was

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:51.640
Radnyshire and Breckinshire and I only lived 200 yards from the River Ellen and if I'd been the

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:58.360
other side I'd have been in Breckinshire. And would not have had to take the the 11 plus I see.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:04.680
Now having taken the 11 plus what school did you then go to John? I went to Landerinder Grammar

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:14.040
School in the first week of September 1959 when a school car driven by Mr Harrell Ashton from the

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:23.320
shop down opposite Jimmy Lloyd's yard drove me down to the bus and then we met the bus up by the

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:31.960
Smithfield in Radar and there was a boys bus and a girls bus. And how long were you at that school

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:41.960
traveling to and from then John? Well I left in 1963 because I'd had a couple of run-ins with Mr

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:50.200
Howells headmaster and I told he said that I had to try my own levels and I said I'll show you and I left.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:13:03.000
If you left right. John you must have seen quite a lot of changes in in the valley. Would you like

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.720
to talk a little bit about the development of the valley as you know it? Well I've seen lots of

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:17.800
changes not for the better in my opinion. I you know although I'm a proud Welshman,

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:25.000
Birmingham were very good landlords and they were good to the farmers and they would provide new

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.800
gates and hurdles and fencing material every year and then when it changed over to Welsh water

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:43.400
it was a downward spiral and I think the valley was much better in those days, much tidier.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:49.560
You could fish from the Cabin Dam to Garrod Dee that railway line had two or three sheep in it

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:56.920
and it kept all the foliage down. Now it's just like a jungle and you can't fish one yard of it.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:04.920
Very very unfortunate because fishing is really quite a prominent activity in our area isn't it?

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:12.760
Yes. Speaking about the livestock now how often did you actually come into Rhaerdyd to the market

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:19.720
or to any other market? Well I don't remember coming much. My father you know would bring

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:28.520
a cow or cow and calf or something occasionally to the mart and we'd always sell our sail ews

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:37.880
in the autumn and we drove them down with two dogs and I sometimes walked in front and my father

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:45.240
behind and we never lost one. We always got them to the market and tied the dogs up there all day

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:56.280
and sold and one year the prices were poor so we didn't sell. I was about 16 at the time.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:04.600
Anyway my father was getting on then and a car stopped when we were driving these sheep home

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:12.120
and he offered father a lift home and he said I'll leave my dog with you and as soon as father got in

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:21.560
the car the dog went back towards Rhaerdyd and unfortunately he got killed by a car and I got

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:29.240
the sheep home with my dog and then my sister Joan went back to Rhaerdyd in the van to look for this

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:36.840
dog and found him dead on the road and brought him back. Oh how unfortunate one that I'm showing.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:44.040
We took the sheep to the next fair and didn't do any better so we may as well have sold them on the

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:53.000
first fair. All memories of course Joan aren't they? Yes. Now if we could come back to the school I

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.200
believe you had some relatives that actually taught at that school John can you tell us a

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:04.600
little bit about that please? Well they didn't teach at that school they taught at the old school

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:11.880
up the cabin which is now under the water. I think they moved here in 1891

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:23.640
Elizabeth Abley and her sister Alice Ann Abley who became my grandmother. She married Evan Jones from

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:31.320
Uppalantalloch and they were brought here to teach English because they knew that the dams

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:37.640
was coming and there was a lot of English and Irish and Scots people moving into the area

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:42.600
so that was the end of the Welsh language in the Allen Valley school.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:53.720
The demise of the Welsh language in the valley is something I'd like to touch on now. Prior to that

00:16:53.720 --> 00:17:00.360
your family would have been Welsh speakers presumably your ancestors. Yes. Do you actually

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:07.160
remember any of your family older relatives actually speaking Welsh as their day-to-day

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:15.160
language? Well my father could speak Welsh quite good but as he had an English mother there was

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:24.360
English spoke at home you know but his father was fluent Welsh and then on my mother's side the family

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:31.960
they were all fluent Welsh but you know they had died before I was sort of born so

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:44.040
and my grandfather and grandmother from the clean they were more English than Welsh because they were

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:51.560
both well one was brought up at the Gunfair and the other was born brought up at the Dunfan New

00:17:52.520 --> 00:18:02.200
Bridge on Wye. I see and so was Welsh not taught at all then in either of those schools the the

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:08.600
old one you've mentioned and the current one was Welsh not taught at all? No there was no Welsh in

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:15.560
school when I was there well we did the national anthem and that in Welsh but no it was all English.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:22.760
I see and what about your grammar school days then in in Llandrindod did you learn Welsh there

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:31.240
at all? Yes when I went to Llandrindod I had the choice to either learn Welsh or French and I

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:36.760
was taught Welsh with a teacher called Annie Griffiths.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:49.560
Right so sadly well there's a real resurgence now in learning Welsh of course but it's you know

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:55.880
it's a little sad. Yeah my two grandchildren now Arthur and Marnie are both in the Welsh unit.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:04.360
That's a very good idea that's here in Raerdyr is it? Yes in yes in Brinterion which I'm very

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:14.280
pleased about because I am very Welsh you know in my thoughts. Very commendable John I'm sure.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:20.840
John could we touch on pony trekking I understand you had quite an involvement in that in your

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:29.080
younger days. Yes I was on the pony trekking committee for many years they were called Raerdyr

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:37.400
Pony Trekking Association and Mr David Evans was the secretary and people like Kinsey Morgan

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:45.400
and Gerald Morgan were chairman and vice chairman and I was always interested in it probably because

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:56.280
every year a lot of pretty girls came along and I met one called Gina Day and after an on and off

00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:04.360
romance for four years I married her and she is now still called Gina Jones but unfortunately

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:12.520
we got divorced but the trekking was a wonderful thing and I've seen up to a hundred ponies going

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:21.720
out on a day you know terrific line of trekkers and they came from all over the well all over

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:31.880
Europe actually but in the end I was guide for two years and it was a much harder job then because

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:39.800
instead of having a trekker for a week who would pick up things you had day trekkers and half of

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:45.720
them couldn't ride and you couldn't go any faster than the slowest rider or the poorest rider and

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:53.720
some of you had to lead you know but I always found out that if anybody arrived on a motorbike

00:20:54.280 --> 00:21:00.200
they could ride and was the balance was right I've never seen a poor rider off a motorbike

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:08.520
using the same muscles I wouldn't I wouldn't doubt fine now John you've spoken about

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:17.320
riding your bike a lot for recreation etc did you use horses as a means of transport

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:24.040
for getting around generally at all oh yes my father was always on horseback he used to do

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:31.480
all the gathering of sheep on horseback and I rode a horse a lot like I was probably riding

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:39.880
a three-year-old I think I started off on the donkey in aboriginal but I've got a photo of me on that and

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:50.040
we had a hill up above the clover and down called clivia so when we wanted to gather that

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:57.800
we were right up to the hen front and then go over the top of the hill and drop down on clivia

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:04.440
always on horseback drive the sheep back down what we wanted to bring down to the hen front

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:11.480
have dinner there with my auntie and uncle and then drive them down to Lenfadog on horseback

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:20.680
but mind you in those days and talking up to 1979 the roads were much quieter than today

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:26.760
and you felt quite happy now you can't go 100 yards without there's a car behind you

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:34.600
things have certainly changed haven't they in the transport department yes and john I understand

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:40.840
you work very hard and long on compiling your family tree and am I right in thinking that it

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:48.360
takes you right back to the louis lois the original landowners yes well me and my son tom

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:55.000
have done a lot of work on it and um I've had help of other people but being as they were sort of

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:02.360
landed gentry it was quite easy to trace them but tom has gone back I think it's 700 years

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:10.120
to the powells from lanarkow who married into the louis lois and I've got it down to this present

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:18.920
day which I'm very proud of and now when the dams are very low the walls of nagwilt have all come

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:26.760
in sight of the gardens you know and that's what I think you know that it all started for me in the

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:33.720
ellen valley well it's wonderful to see these houses suddenly arising out of the water isn't it

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:42.760
it makes you want to do that you mentioned the lanarkow that was and nagwilt I believe where the

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:48.440
where the louis lois lived were they actually in the ellen valley or were they in the cladwyn valley

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:59.800
well it's actually on the banks of the clerwyn river isn't it the nagwilt estate but I mean they

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:08.120
own so much of it right up to clerwyn farm which you know is miles above the clerwyn dam and um

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:17.240
one of my ancestors peter jones from abergwessin who already was a huge landowner over there

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:24.920
and had thousands of sheep he married into the louis lois and the rest is history as they say

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:30.280
and how long have you been working on this family tree then you and your son oh

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:40.440
you're never finished you know there's something comes up new all the time I found a cousin in

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:48.360
london the other day sanders her name is miss sanders and there's a lot of them out in perth

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:58.440
and patagonia and um mother's great uncle david jones had a farm out in

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:08.760
buenos aries and the name of the farm was alvira and my mother named my older sister alvira mary

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:17.000
oh nice right you have grandchildren now now john um are they enjoying being at the valley

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.720
and enjoying the places where you grew up yes because i've still got some ground belonging to

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:31.160
abalone raddug and they love it up there arthur went up the other day to burn a bit of cardboard

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:36.600
and something and he thinks it's wonderful and manny's up there every night with her father

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:42.680
running a dog round and they i think it's nice to get out of town

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:50.840
what better place indeed than the beautiful land the beautiful ellen valley

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:57.320
well john it's been absolutely fascinating talking to you we could go on all day really
