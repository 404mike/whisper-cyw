00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Right, it is the 23rd of August 2022 and I'm here talking to, recording an interview with Ian May there.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Ian, just as a cross reference, could you tell me the year in which you were born?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
1960.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Brilliant, thank you. And to start off, could you give me a little bit of information about yourself, your childhood, where you grew up,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
what your career path followed?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Yep, I was kind of born in Ashford in Kent, went to school at the William Harvey Grammar School in Fogsten.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I did a degree at Reading University and then I worked as a community worker for a couple of years.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Then I joined the NHS management training scheme, I worked in the NHS for a number of years, I worked for the Audit Commission.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And then I retrained, when I was 40, I retrained in public health and struggled to pass the exams, but eventually got there and became consultant in public health.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I'm married, I've got two children, one of whom is upstairs at the moment.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And yes, my interests are music, I like music. I play the accordion badly and I'm a very keen tennis player.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Thank you. And what is your connection with the GOAT group, the Getting Old in the Shed group?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
No, we're not getting old, we're getting on at the Shed.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Oh, beg your pardon, sorry.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:07.000
It's a play on words, we get on in that we meet at the Shed and we get on because we are getting old.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So it's a bit more delicate than getting old.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And how?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
My link with that is I've...

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:27.000
It stems from involvement with our local park, which is a gorgeous old Victorian park, Cottridge Park.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And I've been involved in the Friends group for on and off for the last 20, 25 years, 1997.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
A wonderful woman who is the real driving force behind it.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
She was aware that the council was going to decommission the park.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
We weren't quite sure what that meant, but it didn't seem like a good thing.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And you thought this is the thin end of the wedge.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Next thing you know, they'll be building on the park.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And she made a very powerful argument that you can't do this.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Our Victorian forebears left this for the enjoyment of the people of Birmingham.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And you can't simply make a political choice at this stage just to save money.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So we have managed to hold on to the park.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And ever since then, we've kind of built from doing an annual music festival to them putting on things in the park.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And the building, the shed, as it's called, was put up in...

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Well, it was opened in August 2020.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
So we actually had our second anniversary.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
We had a birthday party on Sunday, which unfortunately I couldn't attend because I was at Green Man.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:50.000
But the goats came about because, and this was just pre-COVID, we put in a bid with the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I think that's probably not... Neighbourhood Network Scheme, that's what it is locally for a group that...

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
There used to be a building in the park which was called the Sons of Rest building.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And it was put up by the Cadbury's as a place for industrial workers who'd retired to meet up.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So we were kind of drawing on that idea for a group called like the goats.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And we put in a bid. So we had some funding initially to get it off the ground.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
But of course, during COVID, all we were able to do really was Zoom calls.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
But it got a lot of thinking done.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000
People were involved in that about what we wanted, what our aims would be.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And then the goats, we were looking at...

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
There was a lot of us were interested in walking.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And I looked at a local walking group called Walkspace.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And on their rather fantastic website, they had some stuff about...

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
That they'd come across about a woman who'd done the walking the pipe thing.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And that turned out to be Kate Green.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I got in touch with her and she sent me all her stuff.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And at one point, we had this rather wild idea that we would walk, do her walk basically.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.000
But some of the people in our group are not sufficiently mobile to do that.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So although we've done a couple of walks out there, done some stretches and actually seen some aqueduct architecture,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
we've certainly haven't done the whole walk.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
73 miles, yes.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
It's really endeared us to Kate.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
But I think the thing that really endeared us to Kate, or the other way around,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
was that she'd sent me this songbook of songs she'd written.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And there's a few people who are musicians within our group.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So we recorded a couple of her songs, actually did them live at the Shed.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And then I sent her the recordings, which is a bit cheeky because we'd actually rewritten some of the verses as well.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
But she kind of thought it was marvelous.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And then she came and visited and then there was that whole Cannon Hill Park bit.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So, yes, it's intriguing how these things just work out.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
You just follow your nose and wonderful things happen.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And last week, you came to the Ellen Vahey for the first time.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Can you tell me what your impressions were of it?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Yeah.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Well, I just made me think, why haven't I been here before?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
I should have come years and years and years ago.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Because it was all so relevant and intriguing.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And I suppose it was the culmination of the little bits and pieces that we've done around the pipe.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:04.000
But to actually see where the water comes from and just enjoy the countryside and marvel at the engineering.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And because you were fantastic hosts, I think the group are rather stunned about how we were treated.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:26.000
It was gorgeous staying in that what looks on the face of it to be a brand new spanking brand new building in the bunkhouse and then having our little tour around.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
So, yeah, everyone's really kind of very chuffed, really.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Well, it was lovely to meet you all.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:44.000
But were you aware of where your water came from before, sort of like your connection with Kate and coming down to visit us?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:53.000
I was. And I think if you question the group, probably 50-50.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:01.000
I mean, some of our group are old enough that they did as school kids go out to Elan Valley.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Actually, I don't think any of the ones that were on the trip fall into that category.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
But certainly we've got one of our number is a history teacher.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Unfortunately, he has to look after his wife a lot of the time, so he couldn't come for an overnight stay.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
But he remembers taking kids there.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And there was another guy down the road who suffers from COPD, so he couldn't make it.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:34.000
But he remembers going out as a kid and people remember the model in their child.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
This is the Cannon Hill Valley model.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:46.000
They remember going there in the 60s as children and pottering around.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And because I didn't know he had a little motor, so it was actually a working model.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:00.000
I guess it was because it's now it's now quite run down and it just sits there looking rather kind of sorry for itself.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:12.000
So we're hoping, obviously, for the 150th anniversary of Cannon Hill Park next year to get the model refurbished and restarted.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And I know our archivist, Matt, working with Kate Green on that.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So hopefully it will all come together the right time.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Yeah, I sincerely hope so.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000
And if we can help in any way, we'd be only too pleased to do what we can do.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Thank you very much for that.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And thank you very much for this interview, Ian.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
That's been really good to talk to you.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
That's a pleasure.
