00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.440
The permission to come to this country came and it was all very secret and very confidential.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:24.320
So my father decided that we shall leave from a particular station in Prague in the afternoon

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.860
and even still to work in the morning.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:35.700
So in the afternoon we came to the station, we took the train to Munich.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:46.540
In Munich we waited for the train which took us to Holland and we went to the Hook of Holland.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:55.780
And I was very happy when we crossed the border of Germany and Holland and we came to Holland,

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:07.540
we came to the Hook of Holland, we boarded the ship and we went to Harich.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:16.740
And on the ship there were little children, English children, who spoke English perfectly.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.740
And I was wondering how it's possible that such little children could speak English so

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.740
well, whereas I couldn't speak a word of English.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:35.140
Anyway, we came to Harich, we took the train to Liverpool Street Station in London,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.340
and then from there we went to my uncle where we stayed with him

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.140
for about three weeks till father started and established the factory.
