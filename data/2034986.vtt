00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.880
Music scene in the 70s in Newport. Newport was the place in Wales for music, not Cardiff,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:36.040
Newport. In Newport we had many different clubs, local bands played in many pubs and

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:44.520
we travelled to different areas for different music. Like in the 70s was the time of festivals,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.160
so we used to travel to different pop festivals, i.e. the Bath Blues Festival which is now

00:00:51.240 --> 00:01:02.280
called Glastonbury. We used to travel every year on August Bank holiday to the free festival

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.440
in Windsor Park. The bands played there every year for nothing but Hawkewind.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.600
To finance going to these festivals, I worked all through the winter and then soon as the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:30.360
spring came and the festival started, I would leave my job and then go to a festival. I would

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.760
work farms picking potatoes, strawberries to make money come in so I could go to the next festival.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.000
Another way of making money at festivals is we used to stay and clear up and you're going to pay

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:54.120
big money to clear up all the rubbish. This is what most people do. To get to festivals,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.360
if you had the money you'd go on a train or you would go on a coach and if you didn't really have

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:11.880
the money to spare to pay for your transport, we were all clubbed together and hired a van

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.160
or with a farm along the motorway.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:26.040
What festivals were like at that time? Value for money. For Â£5 you could go the whole weekend

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.680
and see all the top bands in the world.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:40.600
My wife's eyebrows just rose in surprise and you'd have bands come in from all over the planet

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:51.000
for that festival. I actually seen the first live performance of Don McLean, American Pie

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:01.240
in a festival in Lincoln. At the same festival Monty Pythons played the stage.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:11.960
Surprise visitors for the festival was Raquel Welsh and Princess Anne. They just come around

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:20.280
to have a look. They didn't really integrate into the crowd but they were there. At these festivals

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:33.640
you had venues for famous bands but you also had tents that played music for up and coming bands.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.760
These places, as predicted in the 70s, was all about peace and love.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:53.480
Not many had any violence. I recall the violent festival at Hyde Park which was a festival,

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:03.480
the Rolling Stones done, but it wasn't the crowd, it was Hell's Angels who were hired

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.040
to police the crowd and got drunk and started the violence.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:17.720
My one regret of the 70s was I was going to see Jimi Hendrix at the Isle of Wights.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:26.680
Me and a few friends, we paid the money and the guy who was going to drive us up there

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.920
never ever turned up with the band.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.960
After his next festival Hendrix was dead.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:45.800
During the 80s my attendance to festivals dwindled because this time I was married with a family

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:58.920
and the last big festival I attended was the 1986

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:07.800
Glastonbury Festival where I seen the Wailers minus Bob because he had a long day

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.280
and a few other things but I noticed the change from when I was younger,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.000
mainly the present and a heavy present of police.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:32.920
The organisation totally totally different and it was more of a money making scheme than

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.120
people getting together for the music.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:49.880
If you want to note what one of the festivals I went to you can go online and see what the Lincoln

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:57.400
Festival was like in the 1970s. There are many many quotes from what I've been like

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:05.480
and what I told my wife and when she read these quotes she said whatever everything you told me

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:13.080
about this festival is there from other people. We all went to the festivals together.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:21.720
If you asked an old timer about the NFO in town it was a scrumpy restaurant

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.960
pub and we used to meet there and take off from there.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:42.280
The festival the free festival at Windsor Park was a place that I always met my mate at the main

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:49.720
gates. I would not see him through the year but year after year I would bump into my mate Steve.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:59.960
Because Newport was such an important place it was also the capital

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:09.400
of Britain for drugs so when we went to festivals and they found out we were from Newport

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.600
first words out of most people's mouth is what you sell it.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:23.000
A friend of mine used to have what would you only describe in them days as an Arab tent

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:30.440
a red and white strike one. I used to point them in that direction and they were always full of people.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.200
