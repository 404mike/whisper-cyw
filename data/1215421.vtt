00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560
I'm finding it really difficult. I'm finding it difficult because there's not a lot of

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:16.200
people that are exactly like me and it's hard to pick and choose who you want to be friends

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:23.800
and I'm one of those people who I can just see a person and I'll know there and then

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.400
if I'm going to get on with that person or not.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.600
I haven't met anyone like myself. If I could have another double of me I'd be the happiest

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.680
person on the planet. I wish I could just be able to pick the phone up and speak to

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.960
someone and say do you want to meet up for coffee, for lunch, just to do something. But

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:55.680
I am finding it really really difficult because I find being here everyone's got their own

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.840
lives. Back in South Africa you can just pick up the phone in the morning and say do you

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.760
want to come spend a day together and they're there.
