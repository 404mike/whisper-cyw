00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
What I think has impacted on me lately has been the rival home of the bodies from Afghanistan.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Because that's the sort of thing, when my father was in the army in the First World War,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
all the way through, the worst part of it actually, wouldn't speak about it at all.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But Armistice Day meant something to him.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And then over the years that disappeared, people didn't concentrate, they would think about it, you know, it still drifted away.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And suddenly, the war in Afghanistan and Iraq has registered.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And I think seeing these bodies come back in coffins has had an impact.
