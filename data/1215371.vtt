00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Have you met or talked to other people who feel like you?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Never met anybody ever. I've got one friend with Asperger's for instance at the moment

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
who's got a partner and is doing really really well and they're going to get married

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and even when he's come as a friend he says, well why don't I want a girlfriend George?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Well you're really missing out on something, we need to get you a girlfriend.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And I just literally didn't know why he's got a girlfriend, how he's got a girlfriend, you know

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
why would you want that? Strange.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But I've never met anybody like me. The closest I've gotten onto Wrong Planet

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
which is an autism discussion board where all the people with autism ask about their experiences

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and I've heard one or two people say on there they've had that but I've never met anybody.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Everybody knows autism is either in a relationship or wants one.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
There's many who can't get one and are depressed about it.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
But I've never met anybody who's happy not to have one. No.
