00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Yn ystod y cyfnod, roedd unrhyw un o'n ffrind oedd yn y carg, oedd o'n ei ddweud y ffrind oedd yn y ffactor, roedd yn dod yn y cwmpas i'w gael eu gweithredu.

Roeddwn i'n gael y ffrind oedd yn y ffactor, ond roeddwn i'n gael y ffrind oedd yn y cwmpas i'r ffactor.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Felly, beth oeddech chi, pan fyddwch chi'n mynd i'r ffrind oedd?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Roeddwn yn cael bach yn nghymdeithas i'r gwaith, ac roeddwn yn dda iawn.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Rwyf wedi'i ddod yn y ffrind, ond yna roedd yn mynd i'r Cymru, roedd yn ddod yn y ffrind oedd?

Nid oedd yn cael ffrind, roedd yn ddod i'r ffrind oedd yn cael ei ddod, a ddod i'r ffrind oedd, ac roedd yn ddod i'r cael ei ddod.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Roedd yn cael ffrind, fel yn ddod, fel y dydyn nhw'n dweud.

O. Felly, dweudwch i, beth wnaethon chi ei wneud?

Ie, byddwn yn ymwneud yna, yw'r rhai.

Roeddwn yn y ffatri am 4 neu 5 oedd yn ymwneud.

Roeddwn i'n cael ei ddod i ddod i'r Llanda Amgu neu i'r ffatri ammunisio.

O'r gallwch gael ei ddod, ond roeddwn i'n cael ei ddod yn 6 weiciau.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Felly, wrth gwrs, nid oedd y peth sylw i.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Roeddwn i'n cysylltu gael ei ddod yn ffatri.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Felly roeddwn i'n cysylltu i fynd i'n hoffi oherwydd fy fater yn ddod yn ffatri.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Yr hyn oedd yn dda, oedd wedi bod yn fwy o 20, yna.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Felly roeddwn i'n cael ei ddod, a dweud,

Ond roeddwn i'n cael ei ddod yn ffatri.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:47.460
roedd hi'n cael gwasanaethau post, roedd hi'n cael gwasanaethau tall.

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:51.460
Roedd hi'n cael gwasanaethau allan o'r holl oedd hi'n cael gwasanaeth.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:56.460
Roedd hi wedi gweithio ar unrhyw gweithgaredd, ond roedd hi ddim wedi'i mynd i pethau angen.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.460
Ond yna beth roedd hi'n ei roi, yng nghymdeithas.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:02.460
Ie, roedd hi'n mynd i'n gweithio ar unrhyw gweithredu, roedd hi'n gweithredu ar unrhyw gweithredu.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.460
A beth roedd yna'r gweithredu?

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.460
Roedd hi'n gweithredu ar hynny'n mynd, dwi'n credu.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.460
Roedd hi'n fwy tall o gweithredu,

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.460
ac roedd hi'n cael gwasanaethau yn dechrau'r haesol, ni'n gwybod.

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.460
Roedd hi'n gwybod.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.460
Ynny, ynny.

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.460
Roedd llawer o ffyrdd yn gweithio yn y ffactor?

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.460
Roedd llawer o ffyrdd, i.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.460
Do you know how many of you were there?

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.460
I don't know, I haven't got a clue how many were there.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.460
But most women, yes.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.460
Roedd llawer o ffyrdd yn gweithio i hefyd?

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.460
Well, I don't know.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.460
Mechanics, you know, and that.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:47.460
But I can't remember men on the machines.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.460
No, I can't remember men on the machines.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.460
Roedd llawer o ffyrdd yn gweithio i hefyd.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.460
What did they do then, the men?

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.460
Well, men the machines, yes.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:21:01.460
They were always around if a machine had conked out or anything happened, you know, they'd be there to do it for you.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:09.460
And they had a nurse there, if anybody went ill or anything wrong, there was a nurse there for you.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.460
Were there any kind of injuries and things when you were there?

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.460
No, well no.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.460
There was an injury, there was a needle in your finger.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.460
That was bad enough.

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.460
I think most of us had that once, so we made sure again.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.460
Were there married women working there as well?

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.460
Oh yes, quite a lot of married women too.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.460
A lot of young ones too, minding it.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.460
Yes, there were married women there.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.460
Were there working mothers as well?

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.460
Were the mothers working?

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.460
Or did they tend to leave when they had children?

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.460
Yes, we used to leave.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.460
Yes, we had to leave I think then when you were pregnant.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.460
When you were about three months to go, you'd have your baby, you used to finish then.

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.460
It's the sort of thing you'd done.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.460
You had to leave then?

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.460
Yes.

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.460
They never made you leave, but it's the thing that you've done.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.460
You know.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.460
You had to leave then?

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.460
Yes.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.460
They never made you leave, but it's the thing that you've done.

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.460
You know.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.460
So there were no crèches or child-minding?

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.460
Oh gosh, no, no, nothing like that.

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.460
No.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.460
Well I never worked then once I had the children in there.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.460
Because I had two boys and a girl I had.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:21.460
And once I went out, well no, I never worked after.

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.460
I did go to work once, because Bert was prone to poor accidents.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.460
He worked in the colony then.

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:27.460
And he was prone to accidents, and he'd had this accident, and he'd had a heart attack.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.460
And he'd had a heart attack.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.460
And he'd had a heart attack.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.460
And he'd had a heart attack.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.460
And he'd had a heart attack.

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:37.460
And he'd had a heart attack.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.460
And he was prone to accidents, and he'd had this accident,

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.460
and he was out for about three months I think.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.460
And his sister worked in Hirwaen in a factory there.

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.460
And it was all clothing there.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.460
And he was cutting out things, clothing, cutting out.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.460
And I would never miss school today.

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.460
But anyway, I said I can't see why you can't go to work now,

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.460
because you,

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.460
and he was only a little toddler.

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.460
The other two were in school I think.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.460
And I said I can't see why you can't go to work now,

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.460
well you're out to work, you know.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:03.460
So he was out to work.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.460
So anyway, he said, oh go on then.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.460
Because his two sisters were working of course.

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.460
So Olive, his sister,

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:11.460
had a job for me then up in Hirwaen,

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.460
where she was working.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.460
Well I hated it, I hated it.

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.460
But I stayed there, but of course,

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:19.460
once he finished, I had to go back to work,

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.460
I had to finish.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.460
Do you know what factory that was?

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.460
Oh God, no I don't.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.460
It's over Hirwaen, it's on.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.460
Why did you hate it then?

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.460
I didn't like the kind of work.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.460
I didn't like the kind of work.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.460
Olive, my sister was marvellous.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.460
But of course she was a sewer, see.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.460
Yes.

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.460
Your sister who worked in polycops was there as well,

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.460
was she?

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.460
She was in the dress division, see.

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.460
Yeah, but did she go to Hirwaen?

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.460
Oh no, no.

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.460
I stayed in their factory.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.460
Yes.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:57.460
Can you remember,

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.460
did I ask you this, can you remember how much you were paid?

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.460
I know she was worth £15,000.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.460
But I don't remember

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.460
but I saw all he was having

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:07.460
was £15,000.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.460
I remember him

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.460
as all he was having then,

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.460
see, when he was working.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.460
But he passed for

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.460
Fiam and then they called it

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.460
an official.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.460
And he had a little bit more money, we thought we were

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.460
God's portrait.

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.460
He'd had this exam, but we never thought he'd

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.460
passed, but he did.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.460
He was lucky that he was an official then for years

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.460
and always had extra money.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.460
If he was out to work, he was getting paid

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.460
for it, well he wasn't if it was just a common

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.460
call, you see.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:39.460
So that was all benefits to it.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:41.460
And we moved to Beather after.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.460
Oh yes.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.460
Did you have any

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.460
perks from working in the factory?

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.460
No.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.460
Could you buy cheap clothes?

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.460
No.

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:59.460
No.

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.460
No.

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:03.460
No.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.460
No, never.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.460
What about trade unions then? Were there trade unions in the factory?

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.460
Do you remember?

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.460
What did I know of?

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.460
I can't remember, no I don't think so.

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:19.460
Do you have to wear a uniform?

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.460
No.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:23.460
No, I couldn't wear what you liked.

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.460
I used to wear a lot of

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.460
all-in-one trousers, what was it called now?

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.460
Oh,

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.460
boiler suits.

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.460
Like boiler suits, that had come to fashion there for a long time.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.460
Nearly everybody used to wear them then.

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.460
But no, I didn't have to wear a uniform.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.460
I could wear what I wanted to really.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.460
So why did you wear a boiler suit then?

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:43.460
Oh, I liked the trousers.

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.460
Did you? Yes.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.460
Most of us wore them.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:49.460
Yes, I used to like the boiler suits.

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:51.460
Great for protection, isn't it?

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.460
Yes, and comfortability, they were too.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.460
And great for cycling.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:57.460
Oh, yes.

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.460
Oh, God.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.460
Were there, you know,

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.460
were there any rules and regulations,

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.460
safety rules and regulations in the factory?

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.460
Oh, not a lot, really.

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:13.460
No, not really.

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.460
Just had to watch how we used the machine and so on.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.460
And you can't remember any accidents

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.460
or anything, just the needle through the fingers.

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.460
Yes, a couple of us just have that now and again.

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.460
Do you remember what it was like?

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.460
Was it cold in the factory or hot?

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.460
Do you remember if it was heated

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.460
or, you know, too hot or too cold?

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.460
Well, I don't think we got really cold

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:37.460
because we were using the machines.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:39.460
We used to get warm and see if

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.460
you were using the machines then.

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.460
It was really cold.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.460
I suppose in the winter it was a warm-mind,

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.460
I don't think.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.460
What were the facilities like,

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.460
you know, toilets and stuff like that?

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:55.460
Oh, they were OK.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.460
Yes, they were all right.

00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.460
You used to go up there to have a smoke then, do we?

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.460
It's a smoke then, like...

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.460
So did a lot of the women use to smoke?

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.460
Oh, yes, yes.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.460
And were the employers OK about that?

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.460
They didn't know really, did they? They were upstairs.

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.460
They weren't allowed to smoke

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:15.460
in the factory itself, of course,

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:17.460
because of the clothing, see, you know?

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.460
Do you feel you've suffered

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.460
any long-term effects

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.460
from working there?

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.460
No, I've suffered in my back, mate.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.460
But I suffered in my back anyway,

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:33.460
so that couldn't have helped it.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:35.460
I always suffered in my back.

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.460
Because you were

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.460
over the machine for hours, you know?

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.460
Yes.

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.460
How did the women treat the fellow

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.460
male workers in the factory?

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.460
Oh, they were all great with them.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.460
Yes, all right.

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.460
Yes.

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.460
Just like the men, then.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.460
So what did you do?

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.460
What did you and your gang do?

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.460
You say you went to dances and things.

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.460
Did you used to go with the women

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.460
from the factory?

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:11.460
Well, yes.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.460
Well, some of them, some of them we made friends with.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.460
We used to go. There was one girl, Sibyl,

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:17.460
her name was.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.460
She was from Ystrad.

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.460
And we all,

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.460
there was three of us who used to like dancing.

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.460
We used to come down to the library and pandy, then.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.460
I used to go home at a dinner hour

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.460
and change, and I'd send a note and say,

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:31.460
I was going to picture my father,

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.460
and he would let me go.

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.460
So we used to go down to Sibyl's for tea, then,

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.460
and then we'd go to the library.

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:41.460
And I remember this one night,

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.460
we went to the library and Beryl and I came out

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.460
and we lost the last bus home.

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.460
Oh my God!

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.460
I was in a panic

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:51.460
because I knew I was in for it.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.460
Oh no, my father was quiet, never touched us

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.460
or anything like that.

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.460
But anyway, we walked up to Lloein y Pier hospital,

00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.460
we were there, we caught the last bus from there.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.460
Of course, I had to walk from the new bridge

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.460
up to my house to Blairondda.

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.460
Beryl could go all the way in the best of blank

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:07.460
and she was all right.

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.460
And she was all right with her mother.

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.460
I remember passing my father on the road,

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.460
it was wartime,

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.460
and he had this lamp,

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.460
this carry lamp,

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:19.460
and he was asking,

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.460
I said, I read anything about it.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.460
And my mother said, for God's sake, get to bed.

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.460
She said, your father's on the prowl.

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.460
Of course, before I could get to bed,

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.460
my father came in, didn't he?

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.460
As I said, he never hit me,

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.460
but he caught my arm.

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.460
When he had a temper, he was quiet,

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.460
but when he had a temper, good luck out there.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.460
And I bruised his down here when he caught my arm,

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:41.460
so I didn't talk to him for the fortnight.

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.460
I was going to leave home then,

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.460
I remember that.

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.460
But he was very strict, mind.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.460
And yet I used to go around, mind, places.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.460
You say you went to the library in Pandy,

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.460
was there a dance hall?

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.460
Dance hall, yes.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.460
Was it above the library,

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:03.460
or was that what it was called?

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.460
No, it was called the library.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.460
Right, so it wasn't a library.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.460
Oh, no, no, no, it was a library,

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.460
they used to call it the library, I don't know why.

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:13.460
Because of course it's out of our vicinity,

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.460
really, we've come round on the scene.

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:21.460
But we used to enjoy ourselves in our ways,

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.460
see, we did nothing different,

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.460
as I say.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.460
Yes.

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.460
And tell me,

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.460
just,

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.460
were there any shifts and things,

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.460
or was it just eight to six?

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.460
Eight to six, yes, no shifts.

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:41.460
That's a long day, isn't it?

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.460
Oh, it was a long day, yes,

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.460
but of course, as I say,

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:47.460
that's how it was, yes.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.460
Did you have to clock in and things like that?

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:51.460
Oh, yes, I had to clock in and out, yes.

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.460
Yes, clocks, yes.

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.460
And could you earn overtime?

00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:59.460
Or not?

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.460
Yes, we used to work overtime sometimes.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.460
Yes, we did.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.460
If there was, you know, extra

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.460
orders coming in, I suppose.

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.460
Yes, we used to work overtime, not all the time,

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:11.460
but sometimes we did.

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.460
And do you know how long

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.460
had Parlikoff's been there before

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.460
you started? Had it been there a while?

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.460
Well, not too, not very long, I don't think.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.460
Not very long.

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.460
Perhaps about a 12 month, or?

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.460
Oh, that's...

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.460
Yes, not very long before we went there,

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:29.460
because I was getting on for 16,

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:31.460
I think, when I went there, if I remember rightly.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.460
So did you...

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.460
Were they good employers, do you think?

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.460
Oh, yes, they were okay.

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:41.460
One of them,

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.460
Helen, her name was, oh, she was lovely,

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:45.460
from London, but Doris

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.460
then, the one that was on my,

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.460
where I was on the court.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:51.460
She was only a little bit of a big, but,

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.460
you know, a bit of a bully.

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.460
But she was nice, yes, she was alright.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.460
We got on with them pretty good.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.460
Yeah, all of them, because of the Willendonness,

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.460
see? The Willendonness.

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:05.460
So did you have an annual

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.460
holiday? Did you have a holiday

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:09.460
with pay?

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.460
Yes, I think

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:13.460
we did have a holiday. We had a holiday,

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.460
I know. I can't remember.

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:17.460
Could you take, could you choose

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.460
when to go on holiday, or was it...

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.460
No, I think we had to go when we were

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.460
told, if I remember rightly.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.460
Was it, did the, did the...

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.460
I'm not sure, did the miners holiday

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.460
series do that? I was going to say, did the

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.460
factory shut down?

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.460
Yes, in Worcester.

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:35.460
I'm sure, yes, I'm sure.

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.460
Yeah, we saw miners holiday, didn't we?

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.460
That's right.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.460
I think the faculty, the Londoners, they used to go

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.460
home then, see, I think, if I remember

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.460
rightly, the supervisors,

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:49.460
you know.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.460
So did you used to go anywhere

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.460
on holiday? No, we never went far,

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:55.460
did we?

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.460
Never went far. I can remember the first

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.460
holiday I ever had, I was

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.460
working in the penny bizarre then,

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.460
so I must have been about 15.

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.460
And my first time,

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:07.460
the miners had to pay holiday

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.460
pay. And we,

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:11.460
and they went to

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.460
Barry. I remember their

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.460
father and friends of theirs,

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.460
and my sister and I went with

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:19.460
them.

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.460
And they stayed

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:23.460
in this lady's house, they did, they didn't

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:25.460
know hotels or anything then.

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.460
And he was a lamplighter, because he used to go out every night

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:29.460
and he'd turn on the lamps, you know.

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.460
And I remember I had

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.460
to come home then, before

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.460
Mona wasn't working then, because she was

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:37.460
three years younger than me, my sister.

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.460
Nearly, anyway.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.460
So I had to come home then to go back to work

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:43.460
on the Monday, so I only stayed the weekend.

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:45.460
But they had the first,

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:47.460
that was the first week holiday my parents ever had.

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:49.460
When they were paid

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.460
first.

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.460
And were you working then?

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:55.460
I was working then in Pollycough

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:57.460
to go back then to go to work on the Monday.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:59.460
Yeah.

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:01.460
Did you remember

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:03.460
what you did in Barry on holiday?

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.460
Well we used to go down the beach a lot,

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:07.460
I can remember it well.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:09.460
We used to go down the beach a lot, because there was

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.460
about six or eight of them, you know.

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:13.460
From chapel people, of course.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.460
And we used to meet every day then.

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.460
Well they never

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:19.460
used to do much else, really.

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.460
So down the beach, and then in the night they said

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.460
we used to go out with the lamplighter, me and my sister,

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.460
to light the lamps with him.

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.460
And that was it, really.

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.460
Was that the first time you saw the sea?

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.460
Yes. No, we used to go to the chapel

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.460
see. When we were younger.

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.460
I always had a chapel

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:37.460
run out in me. That was about the only

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.460
thing we had then, I think,

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:41.460
when we were young.

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:43.460
And where did you go with chapel?

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:45.460
Pwyll col o Barry, yeah, that's a star.

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.460
Yes.

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.460
And do you remember

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:53.460
how many days

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:55.460
you had a year?

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.460
There was a fortnight, wasn't it, the miners?

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.460
Yes. Well I can't see where the

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.460
fortnight, I don't know.

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:03.460
I spent

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:05.460
a week. I can't remember.

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:07.460
I can't remember, really.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.460
What about Christmas then? Did you...

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:11.460
Yeah, they used to have whatever, Christmas Day and

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.460
Boxing Day, you know, like

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:15.460
so many days off, I think, yeah.

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:17.460
Oh yeah, we used to have that.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.460
And make us a drink now

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.460
in a minute. Okay, we're nearly

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:27.460
finished, we're nearly finished. Did

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.460
you know when you went to Barry?

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.460
Were there people from work there when you went there?

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:33.460
No, not from work.

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:35.460
I went to my mother and father then, see.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.460
Yeah, but you didn't bump into anybody?

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:39.460
No, not really. I don't know, we might have

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:41.460
bumped into somebody we knew, of course.

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.460
We used to know everybody really then, didn't we?

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.460
Wherever you went.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.460
Yeah.

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.460
Were you allowed days off, you know, when you worked in the

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.460
factory, were you allowed days off for personal

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.460
reasons, like, you know,

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:55.460
if somebody died or something

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.460
or that didn't happen, you know,

00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:59.460
did that happen to you? No, if you were ill,

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:01.460
you just had to send in to say you were sick or something.

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.460
Did you get sick and pay?

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:05.460
No, I don't think so.

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.460
We never used to lose work,

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:09.460
we could help it.

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.460
Did you enjoy

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.460
working in the factory? Yes, I didn't mind it.

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:15.460
As I said, that's the only job I knew

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:17.460
is really in a,

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.460
I didn't mind it, and it was good company,

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.460
we were all in the same boat, weren't we?

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:23.460
You know.

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.460
And then you got married,

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.460
how long was it before you had

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:29.460
children then? Two and a half

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:31.460
years. I got married, I was nearly

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:33.460
20, and I was 22.

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:35.460
Oh, that's right, I was 22

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.460
the week before I was 22, I had David.

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.460
Two years, you can say,

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:41.460
just over two years.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:43.460
And apart from

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:45.460
this,

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:47.460
oh,

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.460
you went back, after

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:51.460
Hirwain, what did you do? Did you work

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:53.460
again after your

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:55.460
children had grown up?

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.460
No.

00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:59.460
No, I never went back to work,

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:01.460
because we kept the clemsie after.

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.460
We moved from

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.460
Tynnywodh, where we lived in Blancwm

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:07.460
Terrace, next, that was the next

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:09.460
place to Blanwanda, and Bert

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:11.460
worked in the Cwm Collery, and

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.460
he travelled a few years, and

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:15.460
he got fed up of travelling all the way

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.460
down to Cwm Collery, he said,

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:19.460
we'll try for a house, collery house,

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.460
so that's what we'd done, and we moved

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:23.460
to Baerdyd.

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:25.460
So we lived there for five years.

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.460
We lived out in Pencolchyr

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:29.460
for a while, and then we had a house

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.460
down in the village,

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.460
and then he found out he had

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:35.460
death, so

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:37.460
we decided, well, I said, you know, to get out of

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.460
the collery, because he had this death,

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.460
and

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.460
he finished in the collery,

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:45.460
and they

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.460
changed the cinema in Baerdyd

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.460
into a club,

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:51.460
a workmen's club, the Cwm Collery

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.460
club, at once.

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.460
So Bert said, I think we'd never been in a club

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:57.460
or anything, and

00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:59.460
I wasn't willing to go, because I said,

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.460
I'd feel my father on my shoulders, you know.

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:03.460
Silly, and I married then, wouldn't I?

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.460
But that's the way we were, see?

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:11.460
Anyway, we tried for the club

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.460
eventually, and we had the interview,

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:15.460
and we had the club, because of course

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:17.460
he was officially in the collery, because he had a bit of

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:19.460
a pull, didn't he?

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:21.460
The people who kept another club

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:23.460
then in Baerdyd showed us all the ropes.

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:25.460
We worked with them for a while to find out

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:27.460
how it was going.

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.460
So we were in Baerdyd then

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:31.460
for two years, I think, we were in the club.

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.460
Well, then the Lewis Merther went

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:35.460
in Porth, and we

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.460
didn't have no living quarters in Baerdyd, so

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:39.460
we had to have a house separate,

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.460
and I was always worried, because I had

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.460
two boys and a girl, and I had to leave them in the

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.460
next, which I'd never done.

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.460
So we

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.460
decided then to try for the one in Porth,

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:51.460
because we had a flat on the premises,

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:53.460
so that's what we did, and that's where we came

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:55.460
to Porth, and we

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:57.460
were in there five years in

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.460
what you call, and

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:01.460
the trouble

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:03.460
or something over the electric, it was

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:05.460
some trouble with the committee over the electric.

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:07.460
Oh, that's

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:09.460
right, they wanted us to pay half

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.460
the electric, because when you go in, you

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:13.460
sign a form, they pay

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:15.460
the electric, and rent, everything is free

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:17.460
for you, but they wanted us

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.460
to pay half the electric, and we refused,

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:21.460
so we finished.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.460
But I wanted Bert to take it, he could have

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:25.460
taken that to court, see, but he wouldn't

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:27.460
of course. So that's how we came

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:29.460
to, we lived in the bungalow then,

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.460
up here,

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.460
and then we'd done

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.460
one or two clubs, reliefs,

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.460
you know, but eventually Bert

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:39.460
had a job in the dairy then,

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.460
he was

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:43.460
with the milk

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:45.460
in the dairy pasteuriser,

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:47.460
and I had a job in the

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.460
canteen, so

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.460
that's where we were then, the canteen

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.460
was fifteen years I think,

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:55.460
and Bert was there a bit longer,

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:57.460
so that's where we, the dairy shut down,

00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.460
we were finished then, didn't it? The canteen

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.460
was taken over by private people, we

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:03.460
had to finish,

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:05.460
and Bert finished about

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.460
two years before his time I think.

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:09.460
That was

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:11.460
it then,

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.460
so we never worked after that.

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:15.460
Well, it was time to finish

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.460
anyway.

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.460
Looking back at those

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:21.460
early years in Poliakofs,

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:23.460
how,

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:25.460
would you say you enjoyed your time

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:27.460
there, what would, you know, tell me

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:29.460
how you feel about it, when

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.460
you look back?

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:33.460
Yes, as I said,

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.460
yes, I quite

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:37.460
enjoyed it, the hours

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:39.460
were long, which we all moaned about, mine a bit,

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:41.460
I used to get tired, didn't we?

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:43.460
But yes, I did

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:45.460
enjoy it, I

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:47.460
liked to go to work, I've always

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:49.460
liked working,

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.460
and I always liked to be in company,

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.460
you know.

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:55.460
And when you left, did you keep in touch with people

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:57.460
from work?

00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:59.460
Well, for a while, but most

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:01.460
of us, we were all going to see,

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:03.460
from a Blaronddor and Blancon and that,

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.460
we all knew each other sort of thing, you know.

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:07.460
So I always kept, because we went

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.460
all together, dancing and pictures and

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:11.460
that then, till we all had different

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:13.460
boyfriends, didn't we?

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.460
And started part

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:17.460
in other ways then.

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:19.460
Are you in touch with anybody now?

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:21.460
All my old friends that I had up there, everyone

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:23.460
has died, except one, and she's

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.460
living up north,

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:27.460
and I've lost touch with Phyllis,

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:29.460
but every one of them have gone.

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.460
And the funny thing, we were,

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:33.460
the crowd that we were with down here,

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:37.460
every one of them have died.

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:39.460
So we were the, went with a different crowd again then.

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.460
Yeah, the old ones where we went

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:45.460
to polycost and dancing and all that,

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:47.460
every one of them have gone.

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:49.460
And the only one left, I left Phyllis is alive,

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:51.460
I lost touch with Phyllis.

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:53.460
She went north, north of England or north of?

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:55.460
Oh yeah, north of England,

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.460
right up the top she was somewhere,

00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:59.460
what's the name of the place?

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:01.460
She used to live right opposite me.

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:05.460
We were good friends.

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.460
But I used to be friends with everybody.

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.460
I never quarrelled with nobody then.

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:13.460
I quarrelled quicker now than I did then.

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:15.460
I was so quiet, see I was.

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:17.460
But you know I never quarrelled with nobody.

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:21.460
Well that's, thank you very much, Matty.

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:23.460
I don't know if I've been much help to you.

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:25.460
Yes you have, that's great.

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.460
Diolch yn fawr.

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:29.460
Oh diolch.

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:31.460
Do you want a cup of coffee now or?
