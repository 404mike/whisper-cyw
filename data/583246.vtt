00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.960
Good morning.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.560
Yesterday I was saying that everything has its beginning in thought, and if we want to

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:29.240
change our world, we must change our thinking until it begins to conform to divine thought.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.800
About four years ago, my wife and I enjoyed our first holiday abroad, and it coincided

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.680
with an invitation to speak at a peace conference in Austria.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.320
I was a little surprised to see a signpost pointing to Prague, and I realized we were

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.600
not far from the Czech border.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:57.200
Our hosts informed us that the Yugoslav and the Hungarian border were, in his words, just

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.800
down the road.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.480
It was before the tremendous changes had taken place in Eastern Europe, and for the first

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.840
time there in Central Europe, I felt vulnerable.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.680
I could well imagine the communist armies massing on the frontier just down the road,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:26.680
and I asked my host how Austria intended to defend those frontiers, and he just laughed.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.680
There's no way we can defend those frontiers.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.800
All the armies and all the weapons in the world cannot defend us.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:43.480
There's only one thing we can do, and that is to make friends.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:50.200
Are there not Russians, Czechs, Hungarians, Yugoslavs here in the conference?

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.480
Our only defense is to change our enemies into friends.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.000
During these last few weeks, we have been thinking of Israel and her vulnerability and

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:14.400
insecurity and the terror that Scud missiles have created by their deadly destruction.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:23.400
The frontier is no barrier to Scud missiles and many other weapons of modern war.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.400
There is no way Israel can defend her frontiers and protect her people from terror and death,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.400
except by making her enemies her friends.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.400
That would require a fundamental change in thinking, in feeling and in will, by the Israelis.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.400
Could it mean loving your enemies?

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.400
It's a thought.
