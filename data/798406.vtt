00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well yeah, we've come here today, it's the first time we've been here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We've come over from Western Supermares, so just the other side of Bristol, just for a day out.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We're all into cider, so we thought we'd come over and give it a go.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We've tried a few so far that we thought were a little bit on the iffy side, but we like one or two that we've tried.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm more into the bottled cider, but so far so good.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We're watching all the people streaming in through the doors and it looks like it's going to be a real busy afternoon.
