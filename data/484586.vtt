00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840
Carnive Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.400
Interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.880
Interviewee Mike Chubb.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.320
The venue is the Swicker office.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.520
And the date today is Tuesday the 2nd of December 2015.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.920
Mike, would you be kind enough to spell your name in full

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.800
for the record, please?

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.160
It's Michael, M-I-C-H-A-E-L, Chubb, C-H-U-B-B.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.920
Thank you very much.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.600
Mike, what are your earliest recollections of the Cardiff

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.200
mass carnival as it was known then?

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.280
Well, I remember going right back to when we talked about

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.400
funding at the time when it was quite difficult to actually

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.440
get screw money out of people.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.200
And we did, we managed it.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.800
And I think from memory serves, you

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.400
managed to get a grant from the arts committee.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.160
Can you remember that?

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.920
From Cardiff County Council and indeed...

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.680
No, City Council.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.680
City Council, sorry.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.880
And Supporting Kind, the first venue for the carnival camp

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.440
was somewhat far away from its key participants, who were

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.160
largely based in Butown, was Insull Court.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.520
Oh, yes.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.480
A very beautiful venue in Clandaff, in the north of the city.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.920
Run by two dancers.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.640
Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.760
And the Rottweiler, as I recall.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.680
Yes.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.360
Anyway, so obviously it was important that we were in touch

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.840
with the project as much as we could.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.160
But at the time, we were really quite busy putting together

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.440
what effectively is one of the first Cardiff festivals, or

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.560
Cardiff summer festivals.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.120
Can you just clarify, what was your role?

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.400
Who were you working for at this point in your life?

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.200
Well, at the time I started, well, the summer festival was

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.040
called the Shopping Festival.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.360
And it was run by a marketeer at Leisure and Amenities.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.240
And I was a play officer, running the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.480
Adventure Playgrounds.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.960
I was really disillusioned with what she did, but I

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.960
couldn't do anything.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.200
It's her bag.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.680
But then she left, and I somehow...

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.360
Theatres, I mean, I've been brought up as an actor, and

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.600
also a drama, and I'm not qualified to teach and all

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.160
that.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.720
But I always felt that the city needed something that was

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.760
exciting.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.040
And what, she was a lovely girl, don't get me wrong, but

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.880
she used to bring in lots of plenty of

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.960
cheek, cheerful clowns.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.200
And if you'd seen one balloon modeler, you'd seen 50 balloon

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.080
modelers.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.160
And I knew there was something different out there.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.760
I knew there was, but I didn't have a clue where.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.920
So I managed to get Leisure and Amenities, who were quite

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.080
supportive, unless I overspent, which I did most of

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.520
the time.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.480
They let me go down to London, and I went to Covent Garden.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.080
And their Dick tea was putting on the Covent Garden Street

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.680
Festival.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.760
So I met Dick, and I saw really amazing street artists

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.480
that have never seen it before.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.480
I was absolutely stunned.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.880
Was Eddie Izzard one of them?

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.840
Because he was performing, and that's where he began.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.760
Yeah, I know.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.200
It was just like, whoa, small town boy, come to London, see

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.120
all this stuff.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.840
Anyway, I met up with an artist called Les Bubb in a pub.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.640
And he put me in touch with his agent.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.720
And he put me in touch with the guy who was responsible

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.480
marketing Orangina.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.560
And to cut a long story short, I bragged 5,000 pounds from

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.080
Orangina the first year, and it was 10,000 the second year.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.040
But that allowed me then to actually really consider what

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.480
do we want to do on the street.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.720
And that's where the summer festival started from.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.120
It was a street festival.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.640
Everything else came afterwards.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.480
But I found more and more of my time was being spent

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.000
organizing this street festival.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.160
So much so that the department getting a bit pissed off with

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.880
me about spending so much time and not doing a proper job.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.440
By then, I was also head of community.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.400
So I was running all the community halls, and that's

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.280
where Rob Corp comes in, who we'll discuss later.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.840
Maybe, if I'm allowed to.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.840
And it got to the point when it was getting quite successful

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.680
after the first or second year.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.600
I was getting more money in.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.680
I wasn't ever spending that much.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.400
And in the end, they gave me the job.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.160
At that time, there were no interviews.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.960
Yeah, go on.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.400
You see what you can do with it.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.400
And that's how it all started.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.440
Would your job title be what?

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.200
Some festival coordinator, festival director?

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.280
I don't think it.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.320
I can't remember what the title was.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.120
You just did it.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.560
Oh, I'll call myself festival director, perhaps.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.600
Much of the chagrin of Mike Turle.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.320
Because Mike Turle used to run the Cardiff Festival, but that

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.280
was in September.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.760
And he was absolutely spitting bricks.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.920
Because the more successful it became, the more the city was

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.480
taken over by amazing things.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.920
He wanted it then to be moved into September.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.040
And I said, no, Mike, no.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.960
It won't suit September.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.400
Yours is an indoor thing.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.400
Mine is outside.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.640
The two don't go together.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.400
Anyway, it got to the point when he tried to run me over

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.680
in the car park, the city hall.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.440
And it's true, because Jane Davidson, who was on the arts

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.800
committee at the time, was there and saw it happen.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.720
Anyway, nevertheless, he didn't.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.880
And going back to the question about Massie.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.320
His lawyers will be in touch.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.800
His lawyers?

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.640
He's dead.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.160
He can't prove anything.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.320
But I remember, so does Jane.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.720
Anyway, Massie impressed me, A, because of the community

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.680
context in which it took place, and B, because you seem to be

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.600
quite a nice guy.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.840
But I'm just saying that for the sake of this recording.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.560
But it ticked all the buttons on the boxes.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.320
Because it wasn't so much the art form.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.760
It was where it was positioned in the whole calendar.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.160
And it was about involvement.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.800
It was about multiculturalism.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.760
It was about open space.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.360
I mean, I used to say about the festival

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.000
that you had to make a detour to avoid it.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.920
That was all free as well, which is most unusual these days.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.880
And there's only one festival I know of in the UK

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.840
that is the same, and that's Stockton on Tees,

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.840
the Riverside Festival run by Frank Wilson.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.600
And he's been doing it.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.160
He started it here at the same time

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.440
as I started the Cardiff Summer Festival.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.400
He's been going for a long, long time.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.240
And his understanding of international arts

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.240
is second to none.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.000
I mean, he just takes so many risks.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.800
It's unbelievable.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.920
This is interesting.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.080
It's about, can a city cope with having it in your face?

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.160
And I know right at the beginning,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:18.400
people in the audience felt so subjected to art in their face

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.160
that one of my artists got hit.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.600
They couldn't cope with it.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.840
Frank knew up in Stockton, because he had no arts at all

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.320
up there until the Dove Cup was started,

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.120
he knew that he could only cope with two days.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.920
Stockton could only cope with two days, a Saturday and Sunday.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.600
Any more than that, the natives go wild.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.280
And over the years, he has educated them,

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.600
so it's now a week.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.960
And of course, in Cardiff, we educated people

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.680
to want more and more challenging stuff.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.000
I'm sure we'll talk about this later,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
but I think we've lost all that now.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.720
I think we've lost the challenge.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.640
I think we're going for something that is corporate.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.360
I think it's been sanitized.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.640
And I think people are genuinely scared.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.080
Everything you see is just either in a building

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:15.320
where it's safe, but nothing is challenging anymore.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.320
Fireworks in an orgy, it's just a mess.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.600
Or in an audience, or marching through a crowd.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.600
Anyway.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:32.680
And hence, my support of Mass and the qualities it brought,

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:37.200
I felt, to the festival, but also to the people who took part.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.800
They seem to really enjoy it.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.280
And it's good that it's gone from strength to strength

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.200
over 25 years, but I'm sure it has been absolutely bloody awful

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.800
to try to fund.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.340
I know that funding is is is horrendous.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.260
And but when I look through it, I mean, for the sake of the recorder,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.140
we've got lots of I've brought all my old stuff.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.180
You know, you can tell I live in the past.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:03.520
Oh, all the old programs, every single one.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.980
I've got a memory of and every single artist

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.900
and every single person who volunteered and who helped.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.980
And I'm sure you're saying with mass, you remember,

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.400
you know, all the kids who are now what they've got kids of their own.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.560
And they're probably children.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.600
That's right. And I think that that's what a city

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.560
thrives on is its history.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.940
And if you get rid of its history or you or you or you start to denigrate

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.740
what's happened in the past, I think you're very poor for it.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.360
And I think there's a lot of my adventure play kids.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.980
I still meet them and they say, Hi, Mike, how you doing?

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.940
And I struggle to remember who they are.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.680
But, you know, that could be Terry, who cut off the head of a chicken

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.520
outside the playground and watched it race down the road, you know,

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.600
or that sort of the Nedra kids who jumped on an inflatable

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.780
when he was one with nappy and nappy fell open and shit went everywhere.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.580
But that's the context in which we were building new and exciting initiatives

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.000
where kids were allowed to play. Yes.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.500
You know, you would give them saws and hammers and the GP

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.540
would deliver telegraph poles and they dig holes and they'd put it

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.580
in the ground themselves.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.760
Now we build chip and structures, which is all safe.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.180
Boring as hell.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.640
So I don't know if you I might be talking about a surprise.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.800
There's definitely a trade off between.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.640
What can I say?

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.760
Freer, more libertarian times, I let's use the use of pyrotechnics

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.560
in the first five to six

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:45.080
carnival carnivals, something now we wouldn't have either the budget

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:50.200
or the entity given the rise of health and safety and risk assessments

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.240
in extremists.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.500
I mean, we're all for minimizing risks.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.700
The job is to actually make them appear bigger than they are.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.320
So you've got to show.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.280
And I'm sure I think you're right.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.420
I think I think the audience has changed as well.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.460
The audience has become not so much risk averse.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.960
I think this is a lot of depth, haven't they?

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.040
They've got lowered up.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:13.620
They're Americanized like this bloody Black Friday nonsense.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.960
You know, and whereas before you'd say, look, come down.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.560
When we did some like Malabar, when we set the streets on fire,

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.760
you know, when they did the show down the bay and there was all was it called?

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.220
What was the Spanish company?

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.300
I can't remember the name now.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.520
Jar Jar was Jar Jar.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.940
Certainly. But there was another one anyway.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.240
And they fired rockets in the audience.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.900
And, you know, initially, people would say, you can't do that.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:42.620
It's too dangerous.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:47.120
Well, if you look at them when they fire a rocket, they turn their back on the person.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.580
So they're in the way of the rocket.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.620
They're entirely professional.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.960
You know, the only fear is in your head, not them.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.000
I've got no fear about them.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.220
Maybe because I've seen it.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.840
I think there's a fatality associated with the Cardiff Summer Festival.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.800
Is there? Have I missed something?

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.220
Not to my knowledge.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:09.580
I might have been a few babies born afterwards or a few heart attacks.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.580
I don't know. But and I think that's I know.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.760
We've I've been so far so long out of it,

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:21.260
because when I started also, I wanted to do certain things on the street.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.000
Like I wanted to crane

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.960
a caravan up in the sky and I wanted people to fall out of it.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.300
It was part of the show.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.460
And I would go to the planner and say, go to the planner and say, look,

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.480
this is what I want to do. You can't do that.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.280
Why can't I do that?

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.360
You say, well, I don't like it.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.160
I said, look, with the greatest respect,

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.260
I don't care whether you like it or not.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.360
It's whether or not it goes against planning regulations.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.600
And I don't have to go to the police.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.660
You know, you know, all the people, the police, the fire service, blah, blah, blah.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.640
And because I was in their territory,

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.800
I found it difficult to get through to them.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.320
So we created the events liaison panel.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.960
Ah, right.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.360
And it's the first one in the country.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.220
Lovely. Which meant that they all sat around a table.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.760
And then you get

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.600
Jerry Toms, who was at the time the head of whatever police in Cardiff,

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.540
when somebody like planner said, oh, I'm not too sure about that.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.640
The people were, why can't you do that?

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.200
You know, and he and he was so he was excellent.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.580
He was he was one of the main reasons the Cardiff festival got off the ground

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.380
because he had an incredibly positive approach to it.

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.280
I didn't know that.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.520
But it's fascinating to hear that.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:42.360
And nothing by bringing in the top policeman on board and him

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.500
joining you in that vision that he was on to a fire service.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:52.400
The same and the planners and and all the health and safety and the

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.000
the ambulance service.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.400
They were all involved. Highways. Highways.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.900
Yes, I was.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.580
You see, they in the end,

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:06.880
I could almost write a blank check in terms of what I could and couldn't do.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.820
I could close roads off.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.280
I could set fire to the streets.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.060
I could I could hang things off buildings like I remember the

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:21.460
there was a Nila Marari from from Paris who did these massive blow up sculptures.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:27.500
I was a great big flamingo on top of one of the department stores.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.440
You know, and stuff like that.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.680
And I don't know whether you could do that these days.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.140
I don't even know if the will is there or indeed the

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.520
I don't know, the the guts to try.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.880
Yeah, yeah.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:42.860
Maybe it's flair.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.520
I mean, but it is guts.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:49.100
It's it's and also I think sometimes you run the risk of trying to be too gutty,

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.720
trying to take on too much.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:55.260
And that's when I got the awful reputations I have, I'm sure of.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.760
Of oh, he doesn't listen.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.060
He's pig head is bull headed.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:04.000
And I think it's down to knowing the vision you want

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.540
of having the people with you who actually support you

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.940
and going for it and taking that risk.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.980
I'm I nowadays, I mean, it is.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.320
I find it quite upsetting that.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:27.220
There's nothing left apart from stuff that's bolted on.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.220
You know, the big weekend was a was a classic

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.560
that came on the back of a fag packets.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.260
Thought, well, why can't we do this?

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.140
So I went to the showman's guild.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:43.740
They said, oh, there's no reason why not.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:44.700
But we're not too sure about.

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.180
So the first year they brought crap machines,

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:50.480
some good machines and some crap machines.

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.300
This is the one that was right next to the Welsh office.

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.040
The seat of government in Wales effectively.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.180
That stopped John Redwood.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.680
Yes, exactly. And you put a fun fair next to it year on year.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.260
I always loved that jigs to position.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:07.220
Yeah, the great unwashed with their hot dogs and kids having a lovely time

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:12.300
with a few meters of the gray buildings where they're in the gray suits.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.600
Well, he can get in, John Redwood.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.560
He couldn't. He wouldn't.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.200
He tried to drive in and there was a great machine in the way.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.700
And he wanted the machine to be moved.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.860
And we said, no, you know, you can get off out the car

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.460
and walk through the front door.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.200
We're not stopping.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.200
The lyrics to the Welsh national anthem while you're doing it.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.300
Oh, yes. Well, he might mime.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.200
Yes. But I remember the after after the

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.500
on the night before that opened, because, of course, that was the feature.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:41.180
Very importantly in in Mass over the years as we joined things together

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.780
and we shared resources.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:46.220
Yeah. But there was the the Lord Mayor at the time now, Vic Riley,

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.260
who's dead now, wonderful guy.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.560
I saw him walking up one of the streets with the fairground rides

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.920
and was walking along, looking like this.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.460
And I came up to him. He didn't know me from Adam.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.600
And I said, Oh, good evening, Mr. Mayor.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.400
He said, Oh, hello.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.900
You know, I said, Who the hell are you?

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.100
I said, This is great, isn't it?

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.040
He said, Yeah, it was my idea.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.240
I said, Was it?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.680
I said, Well, you're to be congratulated as a member of the public.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.040
Well done.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.540
But next year, do you think you could go along that street

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.360
and up that street?

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.800
The next week, after the successful big weekend,

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.660
he stood up in a full council meeting, said, Great idea of mine.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.000
Fantastic weekend.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.040
I want next year for the fair to go that street and that street.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.340
And then it grew like Topsy after that.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.180
It's a lovely story. And I think

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.180
I know a few people who claim to have started Swicker

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.420
after all the carnival carnival in my time as well.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.720
Oh, well, I congratulated them with equal.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.500
Yes. Let them.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.040
It doesn't matter who takes the credit as long as you give me the money.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.180
You know, I can do and I want to carry on the way I want to carry on.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.580
Yes. So and I think.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:18:00.480
But what was interesting is that from those early beginnings

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.220
and that great support that swelled up and the support of Cardiff

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.920
and so it's in the media, but they were always a bit

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:09.320
funny, strange about it.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:09.860
I'm not too sure.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.160
We never got an awful lot of publicity.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.420
I don't know why.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:17.160
Oh, apart from when somebody took all their clothes off, of course,

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:17.960
or anything like that.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.300
But we are in fact close to this interview.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.900
Should you be listening to this sometime in the future?

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.180
Sorry? We, of course, are fully clothed.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.500
Oh, yes. No, no, no, no, no.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.540
Well, I am.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:30.440
Not sure about Steve.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.480
But anyway, I mean, you couldn't even get the date right.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.440
He said the fifth it was 2015 when it's 2014.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.120
Never mind. Never mind.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.780
Anyway, you can count that at the end.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.780
But out of that spawned

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.020
a lot more opportunities throughout the year.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.060
As we found as people realize that,

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:53.660
if you like, that open arts policy, that accessibility policy

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.000
actually ticked a lot of the corporate boxes

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.740
and the city striving.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:04.440
I don't know about the county, but the city striving to provide

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.040
a really excellent service for the public.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.800
So you were clearly.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.440
So you're you're weak.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:11.900
You're weak.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.920
Was going all that was going to be was a

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:17.120
what do you call it?

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.620
And a couple of meetings of European ministers.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.560
And I said, look, why can't we do something for the public?

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.660
Do the public know anything about Europe?

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.620
No. Do we know why we're going into Europe?

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.860
Do we know how much it cost us all that?

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.600
So we decided to create a vehicle, a cultural vehicle

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.860
to go alongside, you feel like the business,

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.660
which is a classic model these days.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.100
And we ended up with Europe Week.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:49.000
And what came out of that, of course, was one of the most

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.580
most proudest of inventions.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.620
And I've got to say, Kerry James, I've got to give credit for

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.720
and that the programming team of the Hayes Island gigs.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.960
Who would have thought turning Hayes Island

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.100
into a lovely gig space right outside St. David's Hall?

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.160
So what used to happen is that you used to come out with their

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.840
dickey bows from St. David's Hall at night to find just

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.400
I mean, let's face it, a lot of people in anoraks

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.700
and having drinks and stuff like that.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.680
And of course, you know, I wonder,

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.240
I'm going to ask you a question now.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.820
Do you think that Swicker,

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:33.380
the artistic policy and the vision behind mass

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.580
did it change slightly over the years?

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.740
With given the the the artist coming in from the festival,

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.580
did it give you spark ideas?

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:48.320
Ah, I say indirectly, I mean, overall, as you pointed out,

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.680
I mean, it was a good self and your team who

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.420
paved the way literally and opened the streets of Cardiff

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:58.660
so that carnival could be take its place amongst those street activities.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.800
We used to admire people like Dada Dang,

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.560
who were the Italian costume drummers who came over.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:10.800
So I think the right word would be to inspire us.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:14.340
Often, you know, here on our doorstep and, as you said,

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.800
nine times out of 10 or even 10 times out of 10, free of charge,

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.840
were some of the the best acts in the UK and indeed from abroad

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:25.880
were being brought so that not only ourselves,

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.480
and by that I mean the our team of artists and designers and makers

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.180
who really had nothing better to go and look at other people's work

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.600
and be inspired, but also the the other two groups,

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.980
the our community participants.

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:40.640
Again, it's sort of up the ante for them.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:44.440
You know, we want to be as good as what we saw in Europe week or whatever.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.980
And the most important is that the work you did over the years

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:54.880
educating the audience so that the audience for the very first parade

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.320
so the very first parade 1990, it came down to St.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.400
Mary Street, which at that point was motorized

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.780
and had a road divide in the middle.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:03.980
And it came down one side.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:07.960
So for one year only, we had a parade which was not visible

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:12.120
from the other side of the street because that was a working road, you know.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.700
But we moved from those positions where, you know, as you built up

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.500
the events, the ASEAN panel, as you built up your track record

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:24.400
of not merely designing events, but delivering them as you described them,

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.800
then we were able to follow, I think, in the wake of that

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.400
as, you know, I mean, you were the

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:36.360
pathfinder, the pioneer, the the door opener, particularly in terms of

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:41.400
getting other departmental officials to even consider

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.860
that these things were worthwhile, because, you know,

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.400
if you're ahead of drains, you just want to talk drains, you know.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.160
But I think, you know, you were yes, I think you were

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:55.140
kind of city council's captain of fun for a number of years.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:59.620
And yeah, no, that was that really helped us in many, many ways.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.460
For which was suitably grateful.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:05.020
I know. Yes, I'm glad you said that.

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:08.760
Because over the years, I mean, it's what I left in.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:13.400
Well, I'm still trying to remember when it was 95, 94, 95 to go to Birmingham.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.700
Dreadful place.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.340
And their lives will be in touch.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.700
I don't give a.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:21.200
Yeah.

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:26.940
Yeah. And it's been what, 10 years now, 10 years

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.440
since a decade ago.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.240
Yeah, since I left 16.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.080
No, yeah.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.580
Whatever. No, I don't know.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:36.920
I can't remember now.

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:40.560
But you see, I'm losing my brain about getting older.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.860
But and you kind of lose sight of what

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:47.000
when somebody comes up to you

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:50.840
and to the other day, I do this community thing called the big picnic

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.100
or did last year anyway.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.240
And there's a guy there.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.540
And I said to him, I said, I know you.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:58.180
And he looked at me, said,

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:02.420
you worked on the first street fest with me being one of the public judges.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.620
And he looked at me, said,

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.020
how did you remember that?

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.120
Because you remember good things, don't you?

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.920
Good moments. Yeah.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.300
And it's and lots of people over the years,

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.760
especially people of my age, like I'm nearly 60 now.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.040
They say, oh, we remember that.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:22.840
Do you remember that?

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.440
Do you know that kids don't remember it?

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:28.040
And you talk about history, and this is why this project is so good.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.880
Because, you know, there was a time there was a time when Cardiff was buzzing

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.980
and its streets were extremely vibrant.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:39.820
That's right. And now it's just full of David's to center

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.780
and which owns some of the land that used to be ours.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.240
And you can't you can't use it without their permission.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.540
We know that we're not allowed to use it either.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:49.480
I mean, that's unbelievable.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.080
They don't support the carnival anyway.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.620
It's absolutely unbelievable.

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.520
They won't even give us a free use of the hoop site.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:55.720
That's unbelievable.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.760
We could buy it off them for two to four thousand pounds, which we don't own.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.860
Which is a hoop site now.

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.460
It's the one outside of the new library.

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:05.220
All right. That's the one where the there's that big burger bar in the summer.

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.800
Either way, I mean, it's their land.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.940
If you want to be there, you pay.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.140
Right. Well, I mean,

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:17.740
it's not dreadful that we I remember when I when I moved to Birmingham,

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:22.120
Cardiff City Council or County Council.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:26.880
Had an arts policy to create an arts policy.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.320
And the week after that, they got rid of all the community grants,

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.660
community arts grants.

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:32.720
And I thought, well, what sort of bloody policy is that?

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.260
They haven't followed it through.

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:36.560
Nothing's been followed through.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.720
There is no policy document.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:42.100
There's nothing that people can in different departments can work towards.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.520
Do you think that what you were trying to achieve and achieved,

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.820
certainly in the early days, which have been lost in your absence,

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.760
that some of that might have been easier to secure?

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.360
Had Cardiff is unusual as a local authority.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:00.740
Those has been in the from ninety one onwards,

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:05.740
for instance, all the other valleys, local authorities would have had a dedicated

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.080
arts development officer and team in post.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.960
Of course, none of those things existed and still don't exist in Cardiff.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:17.400
So it was left to say Mavericks in the best sense of the word,

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.400
like yourself, to to take on.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:22.780
Yeah, imagine you had an arts development team to plug your

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.420
celebration vision into it would have been a lot easier.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.580
But I mean, that wasn't the case in Cardiff, was it?

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.480
I had one. I had one. But it was under adventure play.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:35.120
And that's where Tracy Harding started in the arts team.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.460
And Emma Gellert was on the arts team as well.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.820
And the building team and there was an outdoor pursuits team.

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:45.260
And when when there was what's urban aid, you know, an urban aid came in.

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.340
I talk about the golden days when the lottery came on board.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.740
But there's so much money. Urban aid.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:54.700
I had so many more staff working with these kids.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.340
But yeah, I think to answer the question.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:04.480
A position gives you a certain degree of position.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.140
You know, people saying, you know, that

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:11.240
I was always known as a maverick because basically was created out of nothing.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.680
Yeah, it wasn't it wasn't intentional.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.320
Well, I think it's rather wonderful that that's how this all came about.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.060
Well, it was it was organic.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.320
Yes. Which is very you can't do that these days.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:26.620
No, at all. Because everything or you do it voluntary or you're expected to do it

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.160
voluntary, which was the way the council are going.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.700
Everything is going to be voluntary and, you know, you're going to be left with no

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:33.700
services whatsoever.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:38.000
And it's a shame that the arts have arts have always suffered, haven't they?

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.800
It's always been the poor, the poor.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.500
There's a non statutory. Yes.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:47.780
Yes. Times authority, local authorities, I mean, statutory provision, arts and

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:49.080
culture, non statutory.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.380
I mean, it's the first to go to the wall.

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:55.820
Yeah. I mean, I always said to Kate, my wife, that if I ever win the lottery, if

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:59.760
I do it for every lottery and I win a serious amount of money, I am going to set

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.060
the festival up and do it.

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:02.060
I think that's excellent.

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.320
Yes. But whether or not to be in Cardiff, I don't know.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:09.320
Wherever it is at some point in the future.

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.320
Watch this space.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.320
Watch this space.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:16.240
We'd like to. Mike, can I just thank you for that wonderful interview?

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:20.040
And I think at this point, we have to for future generations who are listening out

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:26.440
there, I'm sure, point out that Mike is an unsung hero of the Cardiff Carnival and

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:31.440
learning about those early days about getting started from scratch and kicking

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:40.820
open the doors of bureaucracy. Mike Chad, you're a carnival hero.

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:42.140
Thank you very much indeed.

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:43.140
Thank you.
