00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.020
Oh, carefree tree, nowhere you can find a pure

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:18.440
and carefree bloom.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.520
The meadows handle with

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.920
with full badleaks

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.820
The meadows handle with

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.820
O love my out of life,

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.820
Let me in the river find my,

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.820
Let me in the water.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.820
And lead me every hour,

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.820
Most gracious Lord,

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.820
No death near might my coming,

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.820
Let me suborn.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:18.820
I need thee, O I need thee,

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.820
Every hour I need thee,

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.820
O bless me now my Savior,

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.820
I come to thee.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.820
My life I belong,

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.820
And my heart I'll plead,

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.820
But yet, he comes and wins,

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.820
I know I won't leave.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.820
My life I belong,

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.820
My life I'll fall,

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.820
But I'll not die,

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.820
Let me in the river find my,

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.820
Let me in the water.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.820
My life I belong,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.820
My life I'll fall,

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.820
But I'll not die,

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:51.820
Let me in the river find my,

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:58.820
Let me in the water.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.820
My life I belong,

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.820
My life I'll fall,

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.820
But I'll not die,

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.820
Let me in the river find my,

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.820
Let me in the water.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.820
My life I belong,
