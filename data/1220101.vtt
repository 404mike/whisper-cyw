00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
And I think in Kuwait, I've got all good memories really, you know, I was very lucky, I had a really happy childhood.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.440
I had a good parent and other than that I had a good sort of teenage years.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:22.640
We used to go out a lot with friends and parties and cinema and all the things young people did in those days.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.440
Were your friends mainly Jewish or Miss Jew?

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.920
Mostly because of the clubs, you know, I went to clubs and that's where I met.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.880
But I had my school friends as well who would always come to a party, you know.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:44.640
I don't remember, everything social seemed to be amongst the Jewish community, I have to say, and Jewish friends.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.120
We'd have parties and everybody.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.680
We had a field, we had a big garden, the bottom of the garden, it's all built over now.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.400
We called it the Wimpy Estate, it's all built up all behind there.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:05.040
We had a field and in the field we had chickens and a couple of goats and a couple of geese

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.720
that used to frighten the life out of us because they were very friendly.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.760
And a horse, which was, my sister was the horse rider, she had a pony, I should really say.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.040
And she absolutely loved it.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.880
Even though there's only 18 months between us, when you're a child,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.880
a sister 18 months older than you doesn't, you know, doesn't want to know you really.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.560
So she was the one and her friends, a lot of her friends had horses or ponies

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.720
and she used to take it to like pony club events but frightened the life out of me.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.440
I wasn't a horse rider, I may have been daring in some things but horse riding wasn't for me.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.400
You were jealous?

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.400
I wasn't jealous, no.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.240
My father did a silly thing to me, it was his fault I didn't like.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.200
It's a silly story, I don't know if you want silly stories.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.000
But he made me get on the horse and I got on and then he threw a stick at the horse

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.800
so the horse would run off with me sitting on it and that was it, finished.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.800
I wasn't, I wouldn't go on the horse again.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.800
So it was his weird sense of humour I reckon.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.280
It was his weird sense of humour I reckon.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.600
Perhaps he didn't want to buy another horse.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.600
He didn't want to buy another horse.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.400
I don't know what made him do that.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.600
He must have thought it was funny.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.960
So you had two sisters and a brother?

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.320
Yes.
