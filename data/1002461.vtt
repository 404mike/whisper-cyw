00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Any wonder about the Welsh language? Just remember, the Romans made them speak Latin first.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Along came the Danes and made them speak Danish, then the Norwegians, and then the Swedish,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and then the Anglo-Saxons, and finally the French made them speak French.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So hence you can see why we might have a little bit of trouble with the Welsh language,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but we owe it to ourselves to keep it alive.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Let's turn to the next song, and the wind will help us with the pronunciation of that again.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And I'm going to ask you to sing the first verse in English,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and the next two verses in Welsh as they are written on your sheet, okay?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Come, great and holy, and then bound,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I bring you all the heavenly ground.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Then shall we all embrace and sing the good and the bad, the free and the bad.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Let's do that once more. Would you like to stand up? Yeah, let's stand up.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Here we go now.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Come, great and holy, and then bound, I bring you all the heavenly ground.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Then shall we all embrace and sing the good and the bad, the free and the bad.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
We're not going to help them, but we'll do well.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And line by line,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000
O yes, the mouth grows onion-beard,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The eye will go on, then onion-beard,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.000
You'll never grow it, for it's dry seed,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
That's really difficult, isn't it?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
For it's dry seed,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Our very diet, you're gonna need.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Okay, gentlemen. Here we go.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
O yes, the mouth grows onion-beard,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
The eye will go on, then onion-beard,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000
You'll never grow it, for it's dry seed,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Our very diet, you're gonna need.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Amen.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Thank you very much.
