So I'm just thinking if you're in a restaurant, would that supporter sit at the same table with you?

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.080
Yes.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.600
Would they, do they need to do that to help you, support you?

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.600
Yes.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.200
Yeah.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.960
And what about like the cinema, would they sit like away from you or next to you?

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.080
They could sit the next row back. Yeah, they could.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.840
How does it feel having, you know, you're going out with your other half and there's someone else there?

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.120
It all comes down to who you've got.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.840
It depends, yeah, it depends very much on the person you're with.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.200
Because they can make or break a situation.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:45.200
Over the years, I've found that definitely they can either make it a day or destroy it.
