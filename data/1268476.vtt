00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.520
In the father, in the island, in the Spanish seas,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:23.120
On the tiny white houses and the orange trees,

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:33.120
And beyond my home, the cool and pleasant breeze,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:41.520
On the Spanish rain will grow green.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.120
There is the red wine and the Spanish hill,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.320
The shallow and arduous, in the ocean's veil,

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:13.920
The sweet, clean, pleasant and the slow, ageless daze,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:23.120
On the Spanish rain will grow green.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:37.920
And now, in the distance, the yellow moon,

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.920
And in the cozy office, the spirit moon,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.320
And the quiet voice calling in,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:16.320
The yellow moon, on the Spanish rain will grow green.
