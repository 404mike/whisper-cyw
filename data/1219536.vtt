WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.920
So this is Hannah Romani interviewing Jenny Allen on the 4th of December 2017 for the

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.080
HLF Wander Brass 25 project.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.360
Could you just confirm that you're willing to do this interview and you've been informed

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.680
of purpose and you give your informed consent?

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.680
I do.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.680
You do?

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.680
I do.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.680
Great.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.640
Okay so maybe if you could just start off by telling me a little bit about when you

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.200
joined Wander Brass?

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:42.240
Okay, I joined Wander Brass probably about nine years ago after a couple of us had been

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.880
playing in another musical project which was a very community based scratch band when we

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.040
all picked up instruments that we hadn't played for a year since school and then we just sort

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.280
of played in that performance and we all really enjoyed playing together so much that we looked

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.600
for other things that we could join.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.440
At first they were like, Wander Brass were like, yeah, trumpets sound great but don't

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.440
worry about the flutes.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.440
Oh no!

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.080
So were there no flutes in Wander Brass then?

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.920
There were, there was just Brett and Kaz and a lady called Kate and they were like,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.160
yeah come along but we're more interested in the trumpets.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:22.360
So Anna Rogers and I joined on flute and Matt and Keith and Fran joined on trumpet and loved

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.360
it.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.360
Oh cool, I didn't realise all four of you joined together.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.360
Yeah, we all joined together.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:34.680
It was just at the start of a project we were doing with King Django so we did our learning

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.520
period and then we did some street gigs and then eventually we ended up playing at Brecon

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.720
with King Django which was really fun.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.720
Oh brilliant.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.720
Okay, great so, okay so the four of you joined together.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.080
Do you want to tell me a bit more about the King Django project?

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.080
I don't know much about that one.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.080
Well that was working with a guy called King Django from America.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.680
I think he's from New York and he's a scar musician, he plays the trombone and he came

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:16.160
over and he brought some of his tracks that he'd written and he taught them to us.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
One of them we still do, it's called Buccaneer Bay.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
Oh no way!

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.760
He got us to do some sort of scar music which I think, I wasn't in the band before this

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.200
but I think it kind of changed the direction of the band a little bit away from more sort

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.600
of jazz and New Orleans stuff into a new sort of scar idea which shook things up a bit and

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.600
it was interesting.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.200
Some of the songs had singing in them so we did what he calls, I think he's like a crowd

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.200
of jerks in a room.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.240
Singing is not meant to sound good, it's meant to sound like a load of people just

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.240
shouting words and having a good time so we did some tunes like that and we recorded them

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.240
in the atrium.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.240
I don't know what happened to the recording and we just did them in Brecon and did a couple

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.240
of gigs.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.240
We did one in the Club de la Barre and yeah that was kind of the introduction to the band

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.240
for us, the first project.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.240
Sounds awesome.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.280
So I remember one of the albums, one of the older albums is quite scary isn't it so I

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.280
guess that must have been, you must have made that one around that time.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.280
I'm not sure actually, I can't remember.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.280
It's got like Scaravan.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.280
I think that was before actually, maybe just before, I'm not sure, I can't remember.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.280
It was a while ago.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.280
You say you went away?

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.280
Oh yeah I went after that project when we were recording the album after that, I went

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.280
away for a year, travelled.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.280
Oh okay.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.280
Cool.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.320
Did you miss it while you were gone?

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.320
Yes, loads.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.320
And when we came back they said we could come in and record over our solos.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.320
I actually am on the album.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.320
That's so nice.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.320
I'm so smart but we're not actually playing in the heads of stuff, we've just got a couple

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.320
of solos on two tracks.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.320
That's really cool.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.320
So which album was that?

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.320
I think it's Blown Away, whichever one's got Buckethead Bay on it.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.320
Okay cool.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.320
It's all a bit blur.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.320
Yeah, oh nice.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.360
So can you tell me about any projects that have really massively stood out for you?

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.360
Maybe it's the King Dango or maybe it's something else.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.360
I guess the biggest one aside from this project has been the 2012 project with Jason Yard.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:34.360
I think it brought the band together in more ways than one because musically the piece

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.360
was really difficult and I think it put us all in the same boat for a while because obviously

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.400
there's a lot of different skill levels in Wunderbass.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.400
It's not just for beginners and it's not just for professionals but I think everybody found

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.400
Jason's piece quite tough to get the hang of and spending two days in the studio learning

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.400
it, getting it down, I think it was a good leveller and everybody felt like we'd sort

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.400
of bonded a bit around that, especially getting to travel to London and be part of something

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.400
in a wider context.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.440
So that one really stood out and obviously Jason's great.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.440
Got to go to the Druidstone and do some workshops with him there and that's always really good

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.440
for the band because everybody has a really good time.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.440
And I think that's the sort of thing that makes Wunderbass what it is because if you're

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.440
happy and you're having a good time the music that you make is going to be better rather

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.440
than like a gruelling sort of schedule that's going to sort of demand a lot of you.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.440
But having a challenge, something to work towards is something that's really good,

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.480
especially when you get there and it all works and it comes together, I think that makes

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.480
people feel like they're really part of something.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.480
Yeah, definitely.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.480
Cool.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:49.480
And has being in Wunderbass led to any other sort of musical endeavours for you?

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.480
It has, yes.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:57.480
I now play in a swing band with Rob and with Yorri who sometimes drums for Wunderbass.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:04.520
Rob and Jenny Bradley and I formed a sort of gypsy, Balkan dance band called Capra Mame

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.520
which was always fun.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:12.520
And just generally meeting people through Wunderbass has opened up some opportunities.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:18.520
I played in a show called Magic with Jenny and somebody who used to be in Wunderbass,

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.520
Gareth Roberts, who's the conductor and that was really fun.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.520
And we did West Side Story, the music for that, which is hard.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:33.560
And yeah, it just opened up quite a few chances to do things which I wouldn't ever have done

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.560
had it not been for Wunderbass.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:43.560
And what do you think about the way the band has changed over the years, both musically

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:49.560
and in terms of the people who are in it and the atmosphere and obviously your own position

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.560
within the band.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.560
You're on the committee now, obviously.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.600
So obviously when you join you just turn up with your flute and you don't know many people

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.600
and all the rest of it.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.600
So how do you feel?

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.600
Sorry, that was a lot of questions in one.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.600
I think all the changes that happen in Wunderbass are pretty organic because the fundamentals

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.600
of the band don't change.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.600
We've always rehearsed on a Tuesday at half past seven until ten o'clock.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.600
We always have a break in the middle.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.600
And I think that the changes that happen are to do with the people who join and the projects

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.640
that we do.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.640
There's always a core of people who are behind what happens with the band and that's generally

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.640
the people on the committee.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.640
And I think a lot of the time that that's...

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.640
I think everybody on the committee tries to listen to what the band wants to do and be

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.640
proactive as well.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.640
So obviously that will push the band in different directions.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.640
My position in the band's obviously changed a lot and I'm quite involved with everything

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.640
now.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.680
But it's really good because you get a lot out of it as well.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.680
It's helped my personal career development.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.680
I've got work, like professional work, not musical work through Wunderbass that I wouldn't

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.680
have got if I hadn't had the chance to develop certain skills through the band.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.680
So I think you get out what you put in a lot of the time.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:17.680
I think the band changes when people realise that more, once they realise what they put

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.680
in is actually making the band better.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.720
It's making themselves have a better experience and doing more projects drives that.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:31.720
Going to Budapest I think was a big changer as well for people who realise actually this

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.720
is really fun.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.720
If we have fun when we're playing it gets more fun.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.720
So I think the changes are driven by the people in the band and the projects that we do.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.720
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.720
What professional skills have you learnt that you're just saying that they contributed to

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.720
your career development?

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.760
What have you learnt?

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.760
Fundraising.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:57.760
I've been working with Jenny Bradley on raising funds for the band, getting sponsorship,

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:04.760
not sponsorship, grants and awards, which obviously she's very experienced at and it's

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:09.760
amazing to get the chance to work in situ in a real life situation with somebody who's

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:14.760
got those skills and that experience and you can learn a lot from that and putting it into

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.760
practice and seeing it be successful is really good.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:23.760
And it's meant that I've been able to do that for other parts of my work.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:31.760
It's also a platform, it's not just a platform for me to play and to perform, it means that

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.760
the opportunities are there to develop things like marketing skills and writing web copy

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:37.760
and developing web content.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.760
I mean it's just great, it looks really good on your CV if you can say I did the website

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.760
for this and this and Wunderbress is one of them because everybody knows Wunderbress so

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.800
just think about that really.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.800
Yeah, cool.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.800
What do you think would be your proudest moment being in Wunderbress?

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:04.800
I think it's when we got the acceptance that we'd got the HLF grant, I think that was

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.800
like a really, because we put in a lot of effort, both of us, actually all of us did,

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:15.800
everybody on the committee put in a lot of work and seeing it pay off and it's great

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:22.840
and also just like whenever the band plays really and it goes down really well it's like

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.840
an achievement for everybody, it's nice to see.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.840
What about musically, what's your...

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.840
Wow.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:37.840
I guess the Jason project was quite an achievement, I mean that music was difficult and the fact

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:43.840
that everybody, I was equally proud to be part of something that sounded like that but

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:48.880
I was also proud of everybody's, how hard everyone had worked to make it come together,

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:54.880
people practiced in their own time, they didn't just rock up at rehearsal and put in the bare

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.880
minimum of effort, people really tried and I think that paid off.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:08.880
So yeah, I'd say the Jason project and recently when we did the Community Music Wales 25th

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:14.920
Birthday, that was really nice as well, that was just like a, because yeah, it was two

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:19.920
different gigs in the same day, we'd done some evening work out in the street and then

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.920
we went and we played in there in the theatre in front of a seated audience who really enjoyed

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:29.920
it and everybody got really on board and that was a good performance.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:36.960
Okay, do you have anything else you'd like to say about Wander Brass, anything you think

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.960
that really needs to be recorded for the future, for people to know about?

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:51.960
Yeah I do, I think Rob has done an amazing thing, it's not an easy job what he has to

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:58.960
do and a lot of the time it can be really challenging and I think that letting it be

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:06.000
and letting it develop as it is has just really contributed massively to the community and

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
kind of not just the musical community but generally, I mean it gives people the opportunity

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
to just really actively partake in something that's creative and I think it's a model

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000
that people could copy and use elsewhere, I think that would be really great if people

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
could see how Wander Brass works and develop their own thing, I think it would be amazing

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.040
for different communities.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:36.040
And what do you think about the way that it sort of fluctuates between being, obviously

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:40.040
it's not a band in which you're meant to come to learn your instruments but sometimes

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:45.040
we have to modify rehearsals for example to accommodate people who have lower levels of

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:51.040
experience or whatever, how do you feel about the way that rehearsals work to accommodate

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.040
that?

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:57.080
I think that in order for the band to be successful and to actually be what it is, we have to

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:04.080
put out professional standard performances because by being part of something that is

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:09.080
professional standard, that is what gives people the confidence and something to work

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:14.080
towards and the sense of pride when they've achieved it and so I think that, yeah, I think

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:19.080
we need to maintain the professional standard but it needs to be accessible to people as

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:24.120
well, so tailoring rehearsals like you mentioned is a really good way of doing that.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.120
I mean we don't have the capacity to teach instrument, like the techniques of basic

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:35.120
instrumentation, not that word, playing your instrument.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:45.120
So realistically we could never get down to that level but in order to put out the product

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:51.160
that we sell, because ultimately that's what it is, then we have to make it as good as

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:58.160
we can possibly make it but by letting people in at an entry level, I think that's all,

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:04.160
there's a platform for people to aim at and there's a way in to get there if that makes

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:10.160
sense, kind of, clumsily put but yeah, I think it does two jobs in one.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.200
So that.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.200
Yeah, cool.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.200
Okay, great, I think that's everything.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.200
Do you have anything to add?

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.200
No, that's everything.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.200
Thanks.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.200
Thanks, Kelly.
