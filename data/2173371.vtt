00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800
I'm Chandrika Joshi, it's the 27th of March, 2024.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.400
I've come to Crowley to interview Jaya Benwaja.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Your name?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Okay, my name is Jaya Benwaja.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I was born in Tanzania in 1943, on the 18th of March.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Where are you from?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Tanzania, in Srinyanga.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So you were born in Srinyanga, where did you grow up?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I grew up there.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I got married at the age of 15.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
My mother was a woman.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We got married without seeing each other.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You got married without seeing each other?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We didn't see each other.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.000
My husband's father, when he saw me, said that he was taking me with my brother's son.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So I decided to marry my husband's father.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I was 15 years old.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Then I got married at the age of 70.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You were married for two years.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I was married for two years.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
With whom did you get married?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I got married to Gordon Waja.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I got married at the age of 70.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Then I came to Uganda.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
My husband's uncle lived in my house.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We lived there for about a year.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
After a year, we went to India.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Oh, right.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
My mother-in-law, my husband's family lived there.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So your husband was born in India?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Yes, my husband was born in India in 1936.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
My mother-in-law lived in a village near the old village.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It's called Paravada.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Paravada.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Paravada.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
My husband lived there.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
How old was your husband when he came to Uganda?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
When he came to Uganda, he was 14 years old.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
He was 14 years old.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
My uncle lived in my house.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Then he gradually took up an education in Uganda.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
In Uganda.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
In Jhentia.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
He was a good man.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
He didn't like English.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.000
My sister and I started working together.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
We had a daughter in the garage.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
She was also a laborer.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Just to learn.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Then she gradually started working in the garage.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
After she learned, she got experience.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Then her grandson opened his own garage.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Okay.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So your marriage was his own garage?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Yes, it was his own garage.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
He married me when he was 24 years old.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Okay.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
He was 24 years old.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
He opened his own garage.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
It was a small garage.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
There was only one person left to work with.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Then he started working.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Then he found work.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
He found work.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
When someone couldn't work, he called him.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
He was a good man.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
He was a good businessman.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
He slowly got an expert position.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Then I went to a garage called Overseas Garage in Chinja.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I started working there.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Then slowly, I stayed at my uncle's house.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
My husband was sad that we had to stay at my son's house.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Then we stayed at our son's house in a Brahmin's house.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Then my elder daughter Nita was born there.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.000
After that, I was born in Jayesh.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Then Jayesh was about 4 years old.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
After that, Shilpa was born.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Rupa was born in 1970.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
We had 4 children.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Our life was very happy.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
It was very good.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
No one was bothering us.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
If someone came from the garage, we would do the work.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
We would wash clothes and do the work.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
We would cook the food.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
We were doing all that.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
After that, it was 10 years ago.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
10 years ago.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Yes, Uganda.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000
After 10 years, my mother came to Chinja.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
She was a Prime Minister.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
She came here.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
I was 12 years old.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:15.000
After that, she took over the entire area.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
She took over Amina.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Did you get a job at that time?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Yes, I got a job.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I didn't get a job after that.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.000
I told my mother that I would be there for a month.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:42.000
She said that I would be there for 90 days.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Then the situation was very bad.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
How did you feel?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
I was very scared.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
In Chinja?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
In Chinja.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
I was afraid that what would happen if someone came from the garage.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I was afraid that people from the army would come.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
I was afraid that they would take away the things I had seen.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
They would take away?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
They would take away.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I was afraid of them.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I was afraid of them.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
They took away my gun.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Oh really?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Yes.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Once in Sanjana, my husband was living in a garage.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
He said that the bullet of the gun had hit him.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Oh my God!

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
He fired the gun?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
He fired the gun.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And the bullet hit him?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Yes, the bullet hit him.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
After coming to Sanjana, he said that he didn't want to open the garage.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
He didn't want to open the garage.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
He stayed at home.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
He didn't go out.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Then he declared that he didn't want to open the garage.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
He didn't want to open the garage.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Then he told me that he wanted to take away the children.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Oh, right.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
So, he took away my four children.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Where did he take away?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
He took away them to England.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
He said that the British passport holder left.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Your British passport?

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Yes, my British passport.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And my brother Gautam?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
He had a British passport.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Yes.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
He had a British passport.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Yes.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Then, my son's name was on my passport.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
My son went with me.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Did you come alone?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Yes, I came alone.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
With your son?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
I came alone with my son.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Okay.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
I came alone.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
I came alone.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And then, the Ugandan refugees, they were very

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
ungrateful.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
They took away the children from the plane.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
They said all that.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
We didn't know where to go.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Were you ungrateful?

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Did you come alone?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
No, we came to Stensted.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
We came to Stensted.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
From there, we received everyone.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000
There was a bus, a big hole.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Yes.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
In Stensted.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
We started giving warm clothes to everyone there.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Because warm clothes were not available.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
No.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Coat, children's cap, scarf, boots, everything.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
We started giving them everything.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Then, they took us.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
We didn't know where to take them.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
But we went there.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
They took us to Wales.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Were you going to Wales?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
We were going to Wales.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Okay.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
We were going to Wales.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
There was a house there.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
We took them there.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
We took them there.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
We took them to each family.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
There was a house there.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
The heating was going on.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Did you have any family with you?

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Yes, my husband.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
My husband's wife, his daughter-in-law,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:32.000
his youngest son, and his son's wife, Shanti Bail.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
He was with us.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Shanti Bail was with us.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
He was our youngest brother.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
We took them to the house.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
We took them to the house.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
How did you feel when you went to Wales?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
We were so happy.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
We were so peaceful.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
We were so scared.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
We were so worried about what would happen.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
We wanted to go to Uganda,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
but we were worried because we wanted to go there sometime.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
So I got a lot of calls.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:17.000
But we had been told that there was no arrivé.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
There wasn't any correspondence from Uganda.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
We had no access.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
So we stayed in this house.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
We drank from the South.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.280
We would have tea, water, breakfast and all that.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.280
We would eat all that.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.280
Then we would go to a big canteen and have breakfast in the morning.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.280
When did you come there?

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:48.280
I came there on October 7th.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.280
So what did you do in the canteen?

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.280
We would go to the canteen every day.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:58.280
In the morning we would have breakfast.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:02.280
Cornflakes and bread.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.280
We would eat a lot of things.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:08.280
We would eat fish fingers.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.280
We would eat fiber and other things.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.280
We would eat dhokra.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:18.280
But we didn't eat fish fingers.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:26.280
Then slowly they started making tea for the Indians.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.280
They started making tea.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:34.280
They made it with cornflakes and rice and vegetables.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.280
How long did you work there?

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.280
In the morning and evening.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.280
We would go there at 5 pm.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.280
They would go there at 5 pm.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.280
My daughter was a nanny.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:50.280
So they would put milk in her milk every morning.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.280
They would put hot milk.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.280
Because she was a nanny.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.280
We would bring a lot of clothes.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:03.280
We would bring clothes, clothes and everything.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.280
Then we would camp for 3 months.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.280
3 months.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.280
Did you cook and make tea?

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.280
We would cook.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:20.280
We would go to a big vineyard in Birmingham.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:28.280
We would take a lot of potatoes and potatoes.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:33.280
We would bring potatoes and potatoes.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.280
We would make roti and stuff.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.280
We would fill our stomachs and go to the vineyard.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.280
This was your first Gujarati meal?

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.280
Yes, it was my first Gujarati meal.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.280
Was it sweet?

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.280
Very much.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.280
We ate a lot.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.280
Then we were young.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.280
Did you bring spices?

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.280
We brought everything from there.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.280
From the vineyard?

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.280
From the vineyard.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.280
We brought all the spices.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.280
We brought all the spices.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.280
Then we went there.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.280
We went to the camp.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.280
We would stay there.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.280
We would bring all the dishes.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.280
We would stay there.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.280
Did you bring money?

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.280
We didn't know about the money.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.280
We didn't know about the money.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.280
We didn't know how to use the money in the camp.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:28.280
Then we went to Uganda.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:33.280
We would give money to the children.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.280
I remember that there were four children.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.280
They gave us 80 pence.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.280
80 pence?

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.280
There were pens.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.280
There were pens.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.280
They didn't have pounds.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.280
I think they were about five pounds.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:54.280
What did you make with the potatoes?

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.280
We made potatoes, roti.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.280
I had a mother-in-law.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.280
I would bring rice for her.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.280
She would eat rice.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:08.280
How many people were there in this house?

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:14.280
There were four children and five of us.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.280
They were...

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.280
Your cousins?

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.280
Yes, my cousins.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.280
My mother-in-law.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.280
Then my uncle.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.280
Her husband.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:32.280
Her son was Jhenti.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.280
Jhenti's sister-in-law.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.280
Her brother-in-law.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.280
We called her sister.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:42.280
We would stay there for 18 years.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.280
When did Gordon come back?

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.280
When did he come back?

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:56.280
He came back about three months later.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.280
Three months later?

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.280
Yes.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:04.280
I told my sister that her husband Shanti was with them.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.280
Oh God.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.280
Did they have a deadline to leave?

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:12.280
No, they left two days ago.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.280
Oh, they left then.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.280
They left last time.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:20.280
I don't know about the other people, but

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.280
I know that one of their friends,

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.280
he was a Brahmin,

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.280
he came first.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.280
He had a brother.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.280
Did they have a problem when they left?

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.280
They...

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:40.280
They would come by bus after they left.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.280
They had a problem.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:46.280
Did they have a problem when they left for Uganda?

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:54.280
I think they didn't have a problem.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.280
Did they have a problem when they left?

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.280
No, they didn't have a problem.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.280
There is a reason for that.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.280
They didn't have a problem.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:06.280
Their brother, Gordon,

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:18.280
They would take the people who were not in the plane to the coach to go to the airport.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:24.280
They would come by bus after that.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:30.280
We would get off at the coach.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.280
At the end of the road.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.280
We would take them inside.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:42.280
I would take four children.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:46.280
Then we would sit and they would say,

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.280
Parcel, parcel, parcel.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.280
Oh really?

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.280
They would bring as many people as they could.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:58.280
I had a few parcels with me.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.280
We would sit there.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:04.280
We would go to the airport when the war broke out.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:08.280
There were so many people in the plane.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:14.280
They would go one by one.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.280
We would sit on the plane.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.280
Did you sit on the plane for the first time?

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.280
Yes, for the first time.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:24.280
We would travel in the plane.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.280
We couldn't do any FOD.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.280
We didn't know.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.280
We would sit on the plane.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.280
Then we would come there.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:42.280
Did you arrange anything for the children?

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.280
Nothing else.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.280
We would give them food.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.280
They would go to play.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.280
Yes, they would go to play.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.280
We would go to school.

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:56.280
When the school was open,

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:04.280
people would go out to play.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:10.280
They would sit on the seats.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.280
It was a big game.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.280
Then we would play at night.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:18.280
We would arrange everything for the pregnant women.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.280
We would arrange everything.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.280
We would go to the camp.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.280
Was it a big globe?

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.280
Yes, we would go there.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.280
We would go there.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:32.280
It was a memorable place.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.280
We couldn't forget anything.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.280
So you would go to the camp first.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.280
Yes, we would go to the camp first.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.280
When we left Uganda,

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.280
the camp was about to start.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.280
It was right.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.280
We would come to the camp after 2-3 days.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.280
Then we would go to the home.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.280
We would play.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.280
Yes, yes.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.280
We would play for 3 months.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.280
3 months.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.280
But we didn't have any problem in the camp.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.280
Nothing.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.280
Then they would ask me for an interview.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.280
They asked me what I was doing.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.280
I said I was doing the work of the garage.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.280
I was working as a mechanic.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.280
I was working with Peter.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.280
Oh, right.

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.280
I was working with Peter.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.280
I was working with Peter.

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.280
He was working on the electric stove.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.280
He was making coal.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.280
He was working on the electric stove.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.280
He was making coal.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.280
Oh, right.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.280
So I was working on this.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.280
So I was working on this.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.280
What was he doing?

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.280
He was a mechanic.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.280
Yes, he was a mechanic.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.280
So I said,

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.280
I will smoke the well.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.280
I will smoke the well.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.280
I put the smoke in the well.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.280
There was the garage work.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.280
There was the garage work.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.280
There was the garage work.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.280
I was working there.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.280
Then,

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.280
I was working

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.280
under the

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.280
paint dress.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.280
Under the paint dress.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.280
Under the paint dress.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.280
There was a top swell

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.280
next to the paint dress.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.280
Oh, top swell. Yes.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.280
There was a garage in the top swell.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.280
Yes.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.280
This was the garage.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.280
I was working there.

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.280
He was happy.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.280
He said he liked the garage work.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.280
He worked there.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.280
Then he started working there.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.280
So you started working before you got the house?

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.280
No, I got the house.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.280
I got the house.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.280
I got the paint dress.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.280
I was a B.A. Welfare officer.

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.280
I was a B.A. Welfare officer.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.280
I took the paint dress to the house.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.280
There, everything was ready.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.280
6 plates.

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.280
Everything was ready.

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.280
6 paint, 6 plates.

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.280
The glass was ready.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.280
The glass was ready.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.280
Everything was ready.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.280
Everything was ready.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.280
Everything was ready.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.280
The bedding, the blankets, everything.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.280
Everything.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.280
Then,

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.280
I gave everything to him.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.280
I gave everything to him.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.280
Then we came there.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.280
Then we settled there.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.280
Then we settled there.

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.280
Then the children's school was going to be built.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.280
Then the children's school was going to be built.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.280
The people there helped us.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.280
There is a school down there.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.280
There were only 4 children.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.280
So we had to cross a road from the house to the school.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.280
So we had to cross a road from the house to the school.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.280
And the children were there.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.280
How did you like the paint dress?

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.280
I liked it very much.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.280
It was our own home.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.280
It was our own home.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.280
We lived there.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.280
But it was our own home.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.280
Then the children came from all around.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.280
Then the children came from all around.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.280
And there was a photo in the paper.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.280
And there was a photo in the paper.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.280
First Ugandan refugees.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.280
First Ugandan refugees.

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.280
Right, okay.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.280
They came to stay here.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.280
Then there was...

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.280
Then there was...

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.280
Oh, Madwaiwa.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.280
I saw in the paper that she was a chemist.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.280
Punjabi.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.280
What was her name?

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.280
She was a chemist.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.280
Madwaiwa.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.280
I read the name in the paper.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.280
And I am a mother.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.280
I am from Punjabi.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.280
I know everything.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.280
I went to Kottomai.

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.280
I went to Kottomai.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.280
I didn't go to India because there was no Asian.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.280
I didn't go to India because there was no Asian.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.280
They said that the shop is just across the street.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.280
They said that the shop is just across the street.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.280
If you do something, you will die here.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.280
So I stayed there and settled there.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.280
So I stayed there and settled there.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.280
So Gautam Brother,

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.280
How did you get into this job?

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.280
How did you get into this job?

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.280
He went to the garage.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.280
He said, you know driving?

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.280
He said, yes, I know.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.280
So he came here by car.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.280
Oh, gosh. Really?

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.280
He took the car.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.280
He said, I have a car.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.280
For my children.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.280
And for my wife.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.280
I want to buy warm clothes.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.280
I could have come from the camp.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.280
But I had to buy more clothes.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.280
I had to buy a coat.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.280
So he said, Ponte Pristh.

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.280
Ponte Pristh.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.280
Ponte Pristh.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.280
There is a shop there.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.280
You can go there.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.280
I remember there was a small village there.

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.280
There was a village.

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.280
We used to buy clothes from there.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.280
Really?

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.280
The first clothes were from the village.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.280
The first clothes were from the village.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.280
And they used to bring 50 pounds

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.280
from Uganda.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.280
So we used to bring some money and go to the camp.

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.280
All of us.

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.280
All the women.

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.280
But to get the benefit of the children,

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.280
we used to go straight to the post office.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.280
We used to bring them.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.280
The rent was only 4 pounds.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.280
4 pounds.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.280
4 pounds.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.280
10 pence bread and 10 pence milk.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.280
Yes.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.280
And the heating included?

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.280
Yes.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.280
The house was very hot.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.280
No carpet.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.280
But it was very fine.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.280
But it was very fine.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.280
Then we used to

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.280
spend time at home

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.280
with the children.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.280
Then we used to bring TV.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.280
We used to bring black and white TV.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.280
We used to bring black and white TV.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.280
The children used to watch.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.280
Then we used to

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.280
slowly

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.280
bring the colour TV.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.280
We used to bring the colour TV.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.280
No sorry.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.280
We used to bring the TV once.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.280
They used to turn off the TV.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.280
Oh no!

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.280
Then we used to bring the TV.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.280
Then the children used to watch.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.280
Yes.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.280
Very much.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.280
Then

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.280
the family used to come.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.280
No one else came?

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.280
No one else came.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.280
Brahmin family.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.280
Oh, Amali family.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.280
Yes.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.280
The Brahmin family came.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.280
I was very happy that someone came.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.280
Someone from Gujarat came.

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.280
He was Indian.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.280
I used to go with him

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.280
to the village.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.280
And

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.280
it was really fine.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.280
How old was Ria?

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.280
Yes.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.280
She was

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.280
six years old.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.280
Six years old.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.280
Did you know the children?

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.280
The children were in the village.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.280
They were very young.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.280
We used to come here

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.280
and play with the children.

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.280
The children used to work here.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.280
So I told my husband

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.280
to do everything for the work.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.280
I went to work.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.280
Then we settled here.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.280
Then we

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.280
bought a house.

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.280
When was Crowley?

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.280
In 1979.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.280
In 1979, Crowley.

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.280
Yes, end of

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.280
December.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.280
How did you

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.280
come to Wales?

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.280
Because there was no work there.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.280
It was difficult

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.280
to get work for the ladies.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.280
And

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.280
for the children.

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.280
Because we didn't know the children.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.280
We took them.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.280
And we came here

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.280
with our own children.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.280
Shanti and Bay.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.280
So you didn't come alone.

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.280
Yes, we didn't come alone.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.280
We didn't have a family.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.280
That's why

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.280
we came here.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.280
So in some respect

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.280
you said you lived in Rwanda.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.280
At that time, you had

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.280
a small Indian family.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.280
But you had to come alone.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.280
Yes, we had to come alone.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.280
And in Penrish

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.280
how did you

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.280
manage to

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.280
eat?

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.280
We used to bring

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.280
from Sparrow

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.280
some capsicum

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.280
some green chillies

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.280
some lotus leaves

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.280
some cauliflower

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.280
some spinach

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.280
and potatoes

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.280
and some other things.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.280
And we used to

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.280
take some

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.280
from the vat

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.280
and we used to

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.280
take some from the mugs

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.280
and we used to do

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.280
this.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.280
So you used to bring

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.280
from the vat?

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.280
Yes, from the vat.

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.280
We used to bring from Darwik.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.280
We used to bring from there

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.280
from the vat.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.280
We used to bring from there

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.280
from the vat.

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.280
We used to bring from there.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.280
We used to bring from there.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.280
Then you came to Krolli

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.280
and

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.280
you bought your own house?

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.280
Yes,

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.280
we bought our own house.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.280
We bought our own house.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.280
And then

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.280
we gave

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.280
the money

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.280
to the deposit.

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.280
We had only that much

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.280
savings because

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.280
we came from Africa.

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.280
Oh, right, okay.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.280
We had only that much.

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.280
Then we

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.280
took a mortgage of 25,000.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.280
And then

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.280
we had to pay

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.280
interest.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.280
Then

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.280
we started like that.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.280
Did you do any work?

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.280
Yes, I

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.280
worked in

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.280
a cigarette factory

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.280
in Wales.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:52.280
We made a filter

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.280
and it was so far

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.280
about 12-15 miles

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.280
away.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.280
So I and my husband used to go out

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.280
by car and

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.280
drop us off at the bus stop.

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.280
Then we would go to Tapsville.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.280
Then

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.280
they would come with us and

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.280
take us there.

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.280
That's how my work was going on.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.280
And you worked in Krolli?

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.280
And you worked in Krolli?

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.280
In Krolli

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.280
I didn't work for a year.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.280
Because

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.280
it was very difficult to get a job.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.280
Then my husband

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.280
went to the job center

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.280
and told him that he wanted to

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:34.280
see his wife's work.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.280
So he

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.280
asked her to go to

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.280
the industrial estate.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.280
There is a sweet factory there.

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.280
He said, go there. So we went there.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.280
We went there.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.280
He called me

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.280
inside

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.280
and took an interview.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.280
He said,

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.280
what work do you know?

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.280
I said, I didn't

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.280
know anything.

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.280
I had told him in Wales

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.280
to add a cigarette

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.280
in the factory.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.280
Then he said, I will tell you.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.280
Then he

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.280
told me, sweet

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.280
factory. I don't know what

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:16.280
it was called. Fudge.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.280
Fudge was made.

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.280
We would fill

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.280
everything in a tray

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.280
and stack it.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.280
That's what I did.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.280
Then

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.280
about

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.280
four years

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.280
I think.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.280
Six years

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.280
later,

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.280
we went there.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.280
Then the factory

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.280
got redundant.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.280
Then

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.280
I thought

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.280
about what work

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.280
I should do.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.280
Then I did

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.280
catering.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.280
I got the work of catering.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.280
We set up the tray.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.280
Food, bread, salad

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.280
and everything was in the plane.

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.280
After all this

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.280
I thought, Saturday, Sunday

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:14.280
I should work from the children's school.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.280
I should not do this

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.280
if I get another job.

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.280
There was a factory

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.280
next door.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.280
I was making batteries.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.280
I went there to ask.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:28.280
I said, I want a job.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.280
He said,

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.280
you want a job?

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.280
Do you have a job?

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.280
When do you want to start?

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.280
I said, right now.

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.280
I have a job

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.280
and I need to give a week's notice.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.280
He said, yes, you give a notice

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.280
and then you come straight here.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.280
Then the work will be ready.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.280
Then I

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.280
got the work from the factory.

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.280
And you said you were going to work

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.280
from this day? Yes.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.280
And you were not going to work on weekends?

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.280
Yes, I was not going to work on weekends.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.280
I was going to work on weekends.

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.280
That's why I got the job.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:08.280
Then from there

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.280
I got the work

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.280
from the Duracell factory.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.280
That too

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.280
was redundant.

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.280
It was not

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.280
redundant.

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.280
If I worked,

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.280
I would get only 4,000-4,500 pounds

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.280
in a short period of time.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:28.280
And from the sweet factory

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.280
I would get 2,000-2,000 pounds.

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:32.280
Then I said,

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.280
when will I get the work

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.280
or not?

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.280
Then the other job

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.280
was

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.280
the Beecham factory.

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.280
There was a factory in Beecham.

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.280
And in the factory

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.280
they made all the medicines.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.280
They made animals

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.280
and humans.

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.280
So there

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.280
I got the work

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.280
and the interviews.

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.280
But they

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.280
knew that I didn't know

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.280
English.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.280
I knew English but

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.280
I didn't know how to write.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.280
I didn't know how to write.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.280
I asked them

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.280
if I could speak in English.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.280
They said,

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.280
you can start from tomorrow.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.280
I worked there for 18 years.

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.280
In Beecham for 18 years?

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.280
Yes, in Beecham for 18 years.

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:30.280
Then the factory

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.280
joined with

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.280
another company

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.280
Glexo.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.280
Glexo.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.280
It joined with Glexo.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.280
It joined.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.280
And then

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.280
all the medicines

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.280
that were made

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.280
were made

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.280
by the animal health company.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.280
One part.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.280
And the other part

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.280
that was left

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.280
where the medicines were made

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.280
was made in the factory.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.280
So there

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.280
I worked for 18 years.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.280
After 18 years

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.280
I retired.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.280
Retired.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:14.280
You think

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:16.280
if you had lived in Uganda

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.280
you would have worked?

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.280
No, you wouldn't have.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.280
No, no.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.280
How would you have lived?

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.280
Oops.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.280
So if you had lived in Uganda

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.280
would you have worked?

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.280
No, you wouldn't have.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:34.280
You would have spent so much experience.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.280
That people

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.280
work,

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.280
women work,

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.280
and so on.

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.280
Plus education wise.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.280
The children got quite educated.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.280
In Uganda

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.280
the children who were earning money

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.280
were also coming to get education.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.280
And this was also

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.280
a benefit.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.280
This was also a benefit.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.280
Because you had free education

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.280
in this country?

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.280
Yes, free education.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.280
Earlier

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:08.280
they gave scholarships.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.280
Do you know?

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.280
And then

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.280
I had a son

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.280
who got educated.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.280
The child was like his sister.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.280
And when the time came

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.280
they got married.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.280
Four children were there.

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.280
No, no, no. They got married.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.280
They got married.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.280
How many grandchildren do you have?

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.280
We all have nine.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.280
Nine grandchildren?

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.280
Yes, yes.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.280
Happy life?

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:40.280
Very happy.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.280
I had a husband

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.280
who passed away

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.280
at the age of 87.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.280
Oh, he died at the age of 87.

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:50.280
Last year, right?

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.280
Yes, yes.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.280
This is my story.

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:56.280
This is your story, yes?

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.280
Yes.
