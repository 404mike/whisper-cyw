00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm Avril Hopwood.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Thank you Avril.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
My grandmother was Marjorie Roach.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And then there's Kenneth Roach and Ruth Roach, my mum.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And then little Avril Roach.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The thing is, my father is very well known.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It doesn't matter where he goes within the county, north or south.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Oh, Ken Roach.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It's like so many people know him.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
They farmed in Llanboydy.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
My father worked on the estate in Bracely until he led in the army.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And then he became a bricklayer.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
But no matter where you go, even if you go into a pub somewhere, someone knows him.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Oh, Ken Roach.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We used to go camping, apparently, when I was a very young child, up in the Bracelys.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It's like 50 years ago.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It was quite a trek to go to the Bracelys, if you can imagine all the lanes.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Cairw was brought up first when I was very young.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And my grandmother is from the Bracely area.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
She was born in the Aberston area, so south of the county.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
She didn't speak Welsh, but we often went camping apparently up in the mountains.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And I love these photos because it's before my brother was born.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And we all look so young, as we do.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It's the things you used to bring.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
There's even a teapot with a tea cozy on it.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I mean, who'd bring a tea cozy camping?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
You wouldn't dream of that today.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
But yeah, I know we used to have a lot of fun.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Me digging in the mud.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Got to dig in the mud, haven't we?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Like some mud pies.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I'm sure there must have been water somewhere because wherever...

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I always found water apparently.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I was always wet.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
We used to play in this...

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
There's a few streams coming down the Bracelys, and they seem to have been less of them now than they were when I was little.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I remember even as a young girl, there were more of a stream.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Whereas now they're like trickles.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
But before you could even find the facial tadpoles and things.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
But nowadays you don't seem to see that in them, which is a shame.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Because I used to bring my girls up when they were young as well.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I live in Haverdwast.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
But I'm again, like, from Caerw originally.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And then we went to Lanffy.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I think we slept in the van.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
From what I remember.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Really, it was like it had a very big bed at the back.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
A very big open bed with bench sheets.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So I think my father slept out under the van.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
From what I've been told.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
My grandmother and me, me cutched in the middle.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Bless.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It's only from what I've been told.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
They more than likely had a mattress in there, I wouldn't be surprised.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I really wouldn't.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It wasn't sleeping bags then.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
It was quilts and blankets.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
But it does look as though it wasn't too cold.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
It looks like it's summer.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So it's not too bad.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Nice silk quilts.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
My grandmother had two or three of them.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And they, I don't know what became of them, which is a shame.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
But I'm lucky enough to have nearly all their photos.
