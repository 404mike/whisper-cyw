00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We love the song that they would never end,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:41.000
When things go wrong, A man is proud and grand, Without a song.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:58.000
That field of gold would never steer now, That field of gold would be at bedroom now,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:11.000
A man is born, And he's no good no how, Without a song.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I've got much trouble I know, But sure as I know there's other than one.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I'll be alone as long as the song is sung in my town, I'll never know what makes that great song,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I'll never know what makes that grass so tall, I only know there is no love at all, Without a song.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I only know there is no love at all, Without a song.
