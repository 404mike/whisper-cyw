00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280
Three. Three. And then you learnt more later? I learnt, I had a smattering of

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:15.860
Croatian when I went to Yugoslavia. Croatian is easy, Slovene isn't

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:25.940
easy. But they were gold in comparison to Hungarian because Hungarian I could

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:34.260
not pick up. I had a two-cent of one year with the High Tatras and Lake Balaton

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.980
and the most I could do in Hungarian was count the numbers, I can't do that now,

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.300
the flaws of people went up in the left. Sorry. We'll come on to that in a minute.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.460
So you were in BrnozÃ¡ros for a while in Argentina. Did you move around in

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.500
Argentina then or did you stay in Buenos Aires?

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:14.940
I stayed in, no it was the other way around, I went, when my money ran out I

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:24.020
started working in Buenos Aires but by that time I had already met my father's

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:36.540
next up Uncle Walter's brother and his wife

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:55.260
and their daughter had gone to America. That was Uncle Walter's wife, all right?

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:02.540
That's Tante Emi to me. These are my two who are now 40. This is a

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.940
picture with the with the ribbon on the frame, yeah, okay. Yeah. So then you came

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:21.580
back from Argentina. Sorry, yeah. Right, I went to Rio Tisero to see my father's

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:34.300
eldest brother with his wife and they didn't have any children of their own,

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:43.860
they had adopted a girl who was really nasty to them for whatever reason. All

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:53.340
the brothers, if you saw them walking you would know that they belonged. They all,

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:01.420
as they walked, somehow a hand, as they walked, they walked with this hand like

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:09.340
that. Was the right hand twisted back? Yeah, really odd. Like paddling? They all had that, I mean

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:17.700
Uncle Walter when he walked, Uncle Herbert, Uncle Peter I didn't know. One of the

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:32.120
older brothers I didn't get to know. Yeah. I got on very very well with Uncle

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:40.280
Herbert and he had wanted me to stay in Rio Tisero. He practically built, I don't know what made

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.640
him go out there, but he practically built the town. It was quite a bustling

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:53.120
town. He said he can remember when there was horses, when there were no roads and

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:00.440
they all rolled and he could remember tethering the, as you do in cowboy

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:14.760
films, tethering it to a bar, tethering the horse to a bar. So you came back to the UK?

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.080
Yeah, sorry, I'm still in Rio Tisero. I then went back to Buenos Aires and then

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:27.360
as the money had run out I then went to work in English Electric and I was

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:35.360
there for the Bay of Pigs incident. My parents were extremely worried but as we

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:50.320
all know nothing happened. And then I went home in 62 and Cardiff, first of all I

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.080
didn't want to live with my parents anymore, I wanted to branch out and live

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.280
on my own. They wouldn't fund me because it wasn't the done thing.
