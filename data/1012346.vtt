A'r un project

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
ac fe wnaethon ni ddod y ddwyllt ymlaen

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
yn cael gweithio tŷ

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
felly, bob un hŷn,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
mae'r ffenedd ymlaen

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
yn y ddwyllt.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Roedd ymlaen cymdeithasol

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
yn bwysig i'r ddwyllt y Gweithdor Cymru,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
felly, fe wnaethon ni ddod prosiectau

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
sy'n ymwneud â'r gweithdor ymlaen

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
a'i gweithio'n dda hyd yn oed,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
gyda'r cyfleoedd ymlaen

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
ac un o'r un ddwyllt ymlaen

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
oedd gael eu ffenedd ymlaen

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
yn y ddwyllt ymlaen

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
a Jessica Mord and the MP came and switched on the Christmas lights

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and I believe that has carried on every year the community meets

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and celebrate Christmas by the shopping centre, the Christmas tree.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
The local councillor then was Christine Jenkins,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
she helped us with the Christmas tree and the lights and you know.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:21.000
So, Mayndi Action Group has been quite a success story in Mayndi

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and the group worked in partnership with Mayndi Festival

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
to win the festival in other projects like community cleaning.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
We did quite a lot of community cleaning and you know,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
just making sure people are proud of where they live

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and are part of solving issues like glittering and things like that.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000
So, it's really, really, really quite good and I hope that continues as well.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000
We did partnership projects as well with the young people,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
working with the local police as well and community house obviously.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
We booked rooms to have meetings with young people,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
learning how to cook, you know.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
So, it was quite wide and those are some of the projects

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.000
which come to my mind, which Mayndi Action Group has been part of.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Over a period of time, were you able to see the impact

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
all of your activities were having?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Yes, eventually we introduced time-making

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and volunteers with Mayndi Action Group actually could get time credits.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
So, that allowed them to access things like going to the Sherman Theatre

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
where some families, you know, because of financial commitments,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
they might not be able to access such activities.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
But with the time-making and time credits,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
they had the opportunity to travel, see places, museums

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
or access the play centres which accepted time credits.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
How does it work?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
For every hour, a volunteer volunteers their time.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:15.000
They can earn, it's not monetary value, it's a time credit, it's like, you know.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So, it's a physical thing like a piece of paper like money here,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000
which they can now use to access services with companies

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
which are part of the time banking.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
It's really, really, really good.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So, Mayndi Action Group were involved with that and they saw the idea

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:44.000
and other groups even in Pell started working and earning time credits as well.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Did you see a rise in the number of volunteers then?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Most volunteers don't volunteer to get something,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:00.000
but in terms of, we had more volunteers,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
but I don't think because they were earning something,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
but it just gave them an opportunity to, you know,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
gift, you can gift the time credits to your friends or whatever.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
So, we had more people involved, even if it was them being gifted time credits

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
and going to some of the trips we organised.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
That was quite a positive.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000
All of the things that you're talking about, it doesn't just happen from nothing.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
What made you go into this type of work?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
What were your earlier experiences as a teenager or young person?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.000
I think I was just got a passion of working with the community

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and, you know, I've got a Christian background.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Helping people is an ethos, which, you know, was really,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
it's in me, you know, since growing up,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
my parents would just encourage people to help where you can

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and help people help themselves.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
So, for me, it's about empowering people to do things for themselves

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and mainly action group, empowered people.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Angell Lloyd, who was our chairperson,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
I feel I could see her grow, her confidence grew,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and she was an ideal chairperson because she still isn't the local lollipop lady,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
but I could see her confidence growing and she enrolled into university,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
did a university course after,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and at the end she was the chair of the community's first cluster group for Peel Stohy Lama in the...

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
For me, that is a success story because I remember the day I approached her to be part of this,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
with like, oh, no, Royce, I can't.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
But it's about giving people confidence and, you know,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
encouraging them to reach their potential.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000
The potential was there in Angela, but she just needed the right, you know, encouragement and support.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
So those are some of the things which you can see.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Or when some of the parents would come and say, oh, you know,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
because of the food bank I was able to save £10, £15,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000
now my kids can go to the school trips in school, I can pay for them, I can afford them.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
So those are the, we might say little things, but the impact on families.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And that child's experience has changed because she can afford, the parents can afford to do things.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And mainly Action Group actually allowed a platform for us to access other services.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
For example, organisations like NEST, the fuel energy,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
would come and give a talk about how they could help families.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
So it's broadened the horizon for residents,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and they would know where to go, what to access, things like that.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
And the good thing is when we started the food co-op,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
we started in St Matthew's Church, which is by Gavu.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
St Matthew's was in Meindie. It's shut down now.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:22.000
We did our best to try and make sure it remains open, but unfortunately that didn't work out.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
But that's where we started our food co-op, and they gave us the venue for free.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And now they are up, is it, I'm trying to remember, the church up the road.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:42.000
So when we set the food bank, we started with the venue,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
we were given a venue by Church in Wales at St Matthew's,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
but unfortunately the building had to close,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
and we moved to Summerhill Baptist Church, and they offered us free space.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And that's where the food co-op is still running as of today.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And quite a number of community events are held there as well,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:14.000
including work with the Arts Council, drama, plays and things like that with the community.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Lois, when you were setting up the Meindie Action Group,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
how did you raise awareness for what you were doing?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
When we set up the Meindie Action Group, we had to come up with the name,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
we had to agree the name, we had to agree the logo and things like that,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
and we thought for us to spread the word about action group,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
we need to involve residents,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.000
and we targeted young people in Meindie Primary School to develop the logo.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:53.000
We had a competition, and the Deputy Mayor at that time came and presented to the child board.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.000
That involved the children, the parents, so automatically we had quite, you know,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:08.000
an audience, and we were able to share what Meindie Action Group aspirations, what we want to do,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
and we, you know, we got a few members from there.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:21.000
With us working with Carol, that was quite a good thing because she opened the school to us as well.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.000
So did you get the children to vote for their favourite designs and narrow it down like that?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Yes.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Do you remember the process?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Yes.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
So when you left Community House, what are you doing today?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
At the moment I'm working with Cardiff Council.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
When did you leave Community House?

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
I left Community House. I never really left Community House.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
As you know, with Community House you always keep coming back and you get invited to events,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
and I don't believe there's a place you can leave.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
You'll always be part of Community House in some shape or form.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
So when I came this morning, Brian was like,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
What are you doing here?

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And I'm like, I'm coming to work. It seems so natural, you know.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000
But I left my post in 2014 and I was doing wider work, including Meindie,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
but encompassing Storhill and Pelt.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
How do you see Community House going forward?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000
How do you see us building on the ethos of building caring communities?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.000
When I was based in Community House, the same issues were there,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
and I believe issues would be there all the time.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:41.000
It's just about working together and seeing how you can get over the challenges

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000
and work in partnerships and in terms of funding, to see what funding that's out there.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
In my role as a Community Development Coordinator, I was looking for, you know,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000
I would help the groups, some of the groups who are using this building in terms of funding,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
to see what sort of funding is out there.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
So it's just about continuing what you're doing with the networks,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000
creating more networks and seeing where you can possibly get funding

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:17.000
and, you know, fundraising activities through the booking of the rooms

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:26.000
and just spreading the word about the work Community House is doing and has done in the past.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:34.000
And I believe Community House will continue to be the heart of the community for years to come.
