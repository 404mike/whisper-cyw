00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:37.000
He makes me down to lie, In pasture's green,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:50.000
He leadeth me, The quiet waters by.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:07.000
My soul, the earth, restore again, And be to walk the plain.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Within the vows of my just guess, He for His own may stay.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Behold, I walk through hell's dark veil, Death will I feel, not yield.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:02:01.000
For the Lord with me and my God, Has set me calm for still.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:19.000
My day or love has perished yet, In presence of my foes.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:37.000
My death, the cross, with all the noise, And my powerful will falls.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Goodness and mercy of my life Shall surely follow me.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And in the sounds forevermore, My dwelling place shall be.
