00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In the waters of my waves,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:24.000
On ashless rocks I chant divine,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000
But the bare glories of thy praise,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:44.000
For all I have, the pride of shine.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
For all I have, the pride of shine,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Who is a morning cloud like me,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:15.000
All who has grace, so rich and free.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Who is straight, is spacious space,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Is the life-giver, the hope of love.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Fill the whole world with grateful praise,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And all the infinite parts of love.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And all the infinite parts of love.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Who is a morning cloud like me,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:27.000
All who has grace, so rich and free.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.000
You are the valley of my might,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The valley of you, the mountain of my.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.000
All through the vast, with your avenue,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:08.000
That hope I make a global dream.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:17.000
That hope I make a global dream.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
God is in love with my destiny,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I'm proud of my hope and hope I hear.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I'm proud of my hope and hope I hear.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000
O my grass and my tall tree,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Come earth, my glory and my hope is.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:05.000
O with me now I am my God-lord,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:15.000
In the air I breathe the river of hope.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:24.000
In the air I breathe the river of hope.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
God is in love with my destiny,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I'm proud of my hope and hope I hear.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I'm proud of my hope and hope I hear.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
God is in love with my destiny,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I'm proud of my hope and hope I hear.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I'm proud of my hope and hope I hear.
