00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is Vicki MacDonald at Holy Trinity Church, Flandernow, during the longest yarn.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And I'm with Brian, who is going to talk to me about his father and the war.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Well, I was born on the 4th of December 1942, and I was born in Bedford, in the county of Bedfordshire.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And the reason was, is that if you had a pregnant wife during the war, and your husband worked and was in the REF 138 Squadron,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Thamesford, which was the spy squadron, you were never allowed to leave the squadron.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
If you wish to see an offspring that was about to be born, the only chance of seeing it is if your wife,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
wherever she lived in the country, was prepared to risk coming to Bedford Hospital and the child being born there.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So my mother decided to take the risk from living in Trinton, Manchester, and took the train heavily pregnant to the hospital in Bedford, where I was born.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And my dad, who was a leading aircraftman in the squadron, was escorted from the squadron by two military police to Bedford Hospital to see me,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
then taken back to the base. He spent the whole of his war in 138 Squadron.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
They flew Lysander aircraft over occupied Europe, and they dropped the spies.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So they would take someone like a Winston Churchill to a secret meeting in France or Germany.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The meeting would take place. The flight would be overnight by moonlight into a field that had three lights of different colors to say,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
safe to land or not safe to land. The meeting would take place maybe in a barn.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The meeting would be finished. The spy would then be back into the Lysander. Lysander would fly back to Thamesford.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:07.000
At Thamesford, there is a very large barn, still there with no windows, and the agent would then be taken from the aircraft at dark to the barn,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
where they would have 48 hours of debriefing and given their new orders.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And then at the end of the 48 hours, the agent would then at night be taken from the barn, put into the Lysander and flown back to occupied Europe.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:31.000
If they were captured, and some of them unfortunately were, then they would be interrogated and they never knew where they were taken to,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
because it was only ever in the dark into a barn with no windows.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
48 hours interrogation, new orders back to the aircraft and then flown into occupied Europe.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So that was what happened. And Brian Lever, born in Bedford Hospital on the 4th of December, 42, left Bedford after one week.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And mum went back to Manchester. And then I spent all the war years with my granny, granddad and mum living in Shrinter, Manchester.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And every evening my granddad took me into his Anderson shelter, where he had a steep garden.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And he dug the Anderson shelter so it was right into the earth. And I can remember my first recollection, I was probably about three years old.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And I can remember the little tea light that my granny lit every night to keep you safe.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So when dad arrived at the end of 45, I'd never met him and never knew him.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And who was this person who came in the middle of my triangle of granny, granddad and mum?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So it was a very tough time for the first six months of me and this person getting to know each other.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And obviously thousands of children during the Second World War had the same problem.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
If you were born early in the war, you never saw your father, you were lucky if he came back.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And if he did came back, he came into an established, normally your grandparents and your mother.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And the arrangement then became this person arrived and you didn't know who it was.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:10.000
That's really interesting. Can I ask you, how did you know about what he did? Did he tell you or did you find his records later in life?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I can tell you a particular story which happened in 1944.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I build and fly model aircraft and I have a modeling room at home just for making and building the aircraft.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And I've got a King's Order commendation on the wall.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And this was my father in 1944.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And the Lye Sanders, there were six of this particular aircraft that did the night flights.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And there was a fighter pilot who had had a mental breakdown.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And the idea of helping him recover was to put him onto bombers rather than fighters, you can imagine.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So the aircraft, the Lye Sanders were on the perimeter of the airfield adjacent to the main runway.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And the Stirling bomber was loaded up for a bombing raid that night.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And the particular pilot who had the breakdown went to the aircraft, he was going to fly it.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And he was fiddling around and he dropped the whole bomb load.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.000
So there was an emergency in the air and everybody had to run to the opposite side because there was a full bomb load, 10 tons of bombs on the perimeter track.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And my dad, God bless him, he couldn't bear the thought of these Lye Sanders all getting blown up to bits.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So he ran and got a tractor and one by one he towed them 150 yards away from where the bombs were without really thinking about it.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
As it was, the bombs never went off.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I hope he got a DSO for this.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:54.000
So he didn't get a DSO for it, but he got a commendation from the King, from the King to say, you know, God bless you for saving all of our Lye Sanders.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And I still have that.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
So how do I know all this?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Because in the latter years of my father's life, 138 Squadron had an annual reunion.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And if you had children from that era, you were allowed to accompany your parents.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So I was very honoured over 12 years of my father's life to go to the annual commemoration of the Squadron and what it did.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
So I met all these amazing people.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And you heard all their stories?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
I heard all their stories, yes.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Amazing.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
It was fantastic.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Yeah. Oh, Brian, thank you so much.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And I have the last Squadron reunion, I think, was in something like, perhaps it was 2002, something like that.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And the format of it was that you met in a pub, you went to a church and we had a church service in Thamesford.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Then you went to the Village Hall.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And for the last one, they managed to get some of the ladies of the era to dress up in their little tiny black uniforms and serve as the meal.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And then we went to the airfield.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And one of my aeromodelling friends, who's a full-size pilot, he flew the Lysander from near Tuxford Airfield.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And they did 10 minutes of flying over us.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And I remember everybody was weeping.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
I can imagine crying, absolutely.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Yeah.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Gosh, lovely, lovely memories.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Thank you so much.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
I'm so pleased that we met.
