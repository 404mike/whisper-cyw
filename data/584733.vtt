00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The interview recorded with Steve Halfway on 8th March 2017 contains some stories which listeners may find upsetting.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Please proceed to listen at your own discretion.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We will now begin recording the interview with Steve Halfway.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The recording takes place on the 8th of March at Oasis on Splot Road.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The volunteers present are Kayleigh Williams and Lara Taffer.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This recording is being collected as an oral history and will be part of the Chronicle Project, a project led by VCS Cymru and funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Would you like to introduce yourself please?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
My name is Steve and I live in Splot and I've lived here for about 20 years now.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I was originally born in Abergavenny which is a little town about an hour away.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I can't speak English but I've been living in Splot for 20 years and the local phrase is I'm now a Splot boy and I feel like I live and belong here.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Could you tell us the story again about how you started volunteering at Oasis?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Okay, about two years ago my big passion is music and I noticed there was a concert on for a Congolese choir

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and I was looking at the flyer on the internet and it said there would also be a small community choir from a local refugee centre.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I thought that's surprising so I looked it up, it was called Oasis, and I was really surprised to find that it was just 100 yards from where I lived.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So I thought, oh that'll be interesting, I'll send them an email and say I haven't got any particular skills, however I can speak English and I'm quite friendly.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And take it from there. So I sent the email and they invited me along.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And how many years ago was that?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
That was probably over two years.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Did you do any other volunteering before you came to Oasis?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I might have done but I can't remember.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
But anyway, do you want me to tell you about the first time I came down?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So I came down as a UK national where everything is well ordered, got a national insurance number, the streets are metal, the street lights come on every day, you turn on the tap and you get water.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And I came down to Oasis and I met people from all over the world.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And when I came in I felt a bit uncomfortable because basically I was the only white person there.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And I went into the cafe room and I'd say that most of the people there would be young black African men where their future is uncertain.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:07.000
They would be asylum seekers where they would come from a part of the world which may well be war torn, where there may not be water on tap, where there might not be metal roads, where things aren't certain.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So it was quite amazing to come in to meet people from around the world where my world is very certain and safe and secure.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And their world on that day would be, they would be asylum seekers in Britain but at any moment they could be told by the home office, sorry you're off home tomorrow.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And so what kind of things do you volunteer for at the centre? What are some of your responsibilities?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Well I came down just to see what was what and then they pointed me in the direction of being in charge of the garden.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And I thought well okay I'll give it a go. And I came down about a week later all ready to make a start.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And I was the only person there waiting to start. And I thought well hang on.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And again this is what I found out about Oasis which is what I like is that things aren't particularly well organised.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.000
There's about three different time zones, African time zone, British time zone and Middle Eastern time zone.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And they don't marry up. But anyway I thought well I don't think this is going to work.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So I hear that they did some English so I went in and said oh you know I understand you do some English.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:40.000
How about if I help out with the English teacher? And that's how I then went along to the first English class.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And she was a very good teacher actually. The current English teacher is good but not as good as the first English teacher.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000
So I went along and I did some work with her and I did it once a week up until now.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Have you ever had the chance to, if music's your passion, share that passion with the people at the refugee centre?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Well occasionally there's been some music here but I can't play an instrument and I can't read the instrument.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.000
But music is my great passion. I go to loads of music. And when they have some music on here I come and listen to it.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And it's brilliant.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Although another thing I've got involved with as well as helping teach English, I help with this conversation group called the fan group called Friends and Neighbours.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And via that I've got to know some Sudanese Muslim women. And recently I arranged for them to come to the opera.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And they absolutely loved it. The opera was really good. Welsh National Opera, a world class opera company.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.000
They were doing La Boeme which is a beautiful opera. And the Welsh National Opera did it to a very high standard which I really enjoyed.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:59.000
But the Sudanese Muslim women absolutely loved it. And I'm passionate about music.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.000
But the thing about opera, if you go to the audiences, dominated by white pensioners. There's no question about it.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
If you go to the opera it'll be dominated by affluent white pensioners.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:20.000
But I like to take young people. And on this occasion I took three Sudanese Muslim women. And they loved it.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:29.000
In fact the young people loved it and the Sudanese Muslim people loved it. So it doesn't have to just be a preserve for old white Afro people.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And so what motivated you to get involved with volunteering here?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:52.000
It seemed like an interest. I'm interested in the world. And probably at the time I thought well I'll be interested. Try it out.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.000
But in retrospect, yeah it's been magnificent. And I've got more out of it than I've put in.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Because just by walking down the road I meet people from all over the world.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:16.000
For example the fan group. One week there was some women from Mosul and also some men from Aleppo.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And how current is that? I mean you can see it on the news, you can read about it on the internet, on the newspapers.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.000
But actually come to meet people who've lived through those experiences. And I find that immense.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
One of our questions is how does volunteering help you get to know your community better?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Well my local community is... I'm well known in my street and they are overwhelmingly white and lived here for decades.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And a few of them are racists to be quite frank. And I know the racists.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:05.000
But some people in... I'd say that these are part of my community as well. The refugees and asylum seekers.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And the thing I like about Splott is that over the 20 years I've lived here it has become more and more multicultural.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And I don't say that people love each other, but they get on. Which is really magnificent.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And what I'm proud of in Splott is that this place sits here and there's no bother. No bother.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I'm not saying that the local community can flood it in and they all do things together.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.000
But it sits here, it's quite obviously for... the great majority of people who come in will be young African men.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
But it doesn't have any problems.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
One of the groups that we've interviewed before was Adams Down Arts Association.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And... pause for a second.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
So I was mentioning before, one of the previous interviews we did was with Adams Down Arts Association.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And they had run a program here. Did you?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000
No.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
No? I'm involved in that. Just thought I would ask.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:12.000
So what... they obviously have a craft room and they do sports. What are some of the other programs that they have available?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Well I'm only involved in the English language teaching and the fan group. I know there's lots of other things going on.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
But exactly what I don't know.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:30.000
But I guess that the main thing is it's a centre for people to come together, asylum seekers and refugees, where they get companionship.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:39.000
I think the biggest thing is probably the cafe. Where people can go in and they'll have a friendly face to chat with.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Do you know how many volunteers are...

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
I don't know. I don't know.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And the thing is I love doing this. It's completely informal. I've found my own way in and I now do what I enjoy.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And I've got to know people and chat to all sorts of people.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
But the formal structure I don't know.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Are you given a lot of autonomy to choose what kinds of things you do?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Yes, yeah. I think I am, yeah.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And the thing is I choose to do this work and I love OASIS and I come down a couple of times a week.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And I could do a bit more if people ask me or if there's a specific thing I would like.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
But I'm very boundaried in terms of I don't want to take on too much.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Because the people at OASIS, the asylum seekers and refugees are, in my experience, lovely good-hearted people.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
But their needs are immense.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And I don't want to... I'm not going to give too much.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Because it would just suck me dry.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Just give what you can.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Yeah, well, I give what I can and I give what I enjoy giving.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
But I've got the luxury of saying so far but no further.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Does anybody else in your family or friends volunteer here with you?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Yeah, not my family but my... I've got some friends come.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
They came out to help out with English as well, yeah.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Probably two other friends.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Were you the inspiration for that?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
I wouldn't say inspiration but...

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Yeah, I put the finger on them and they come.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And in fact my friend Stuart comes and he loves it.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
He absolutely loves it.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Are there any frustrations or disappointments that you find by doing volunteer work?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:37.000
No. As I say, if I've found any frustrations or disappointments or anything I didn't like, I just wouldn't do it.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Because I'm retired. I've got the luxury of choosing what I do and what I don't do.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
So it is very luxurious.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Do you have any favourite memories of volunteering here that stand out?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:57.000
I'm sure I have. It doesn't occur to me at the moment but I'm sure not.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
If it comes back to me I'll tell you.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
It's one that's hard to do on the spot.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:11.000
For example, the women that came from Mosul and some women that came from Aleppo.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Another very powerful experience was when a woman came to the discussion group and she was from Syria and couldn't speak much English.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000
But she told you very clearly what it was like to go through that experience.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:39.000
She made her journey with her family from Syria, a war tour zone, via Libya.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And she told us how on one occasion she was stopped at where the Czech soldiers are.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And her daughter was taken away and raped.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:04.000
And then they got on a boat to come to Europe and the boat sank and two of her sons were drowned.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And what do you say?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
That was very memorable. Not the best memory but extremely memorable.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Do you think that volunteering here has changed you in any way?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I think it's enriched my life. I don't know if it's changed me but I've met some good people here and I've become friends with a few refugees.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Which is really good. So I think it's built on my life. I'm still the same old difficult bugger I was.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:45.000
How do you think your volunteering or even volunteering here has benefited the wider community and the people that come in here and seek help?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
The wider community? I don't know.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
But the people who've come here.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
But I think just a friendly UK national who can speak the English language and is willing to talk.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
I think that's my guess. I think that's more than a guess.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
That is beneficial to the refugees and asylum seekers who want to learn English.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Because they, like everybody, if you go abroad on holiday, like to Spain, go with your friends or your family.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And it's incredible how little Spanish you'll have to speak.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
You point, say por favor, dos, and that's about it.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
But you don't have to learn. And this is the same with people here.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
People come from Eritrea. They live together. They have their little Eritrean cafe.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And so the old bit of English. So to actually speak with a UK native speaker, I think is immense.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And so do you actually lead the ESOL classes?

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
No, I am the helper. They tried to make me the teacher, but I refuse.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
I am a very experienced helper for the teacher.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
But a very bad English teacher.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
What does helping entail?

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
What it entails is you have the teacher, the front is called Richard, very nice man.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
And help, I ask him awkward questions.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Because I find my natural environment is to sit at the back with the African men, right?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Who tend to be a bit, you know, keep out of the way.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
But I encourage them to come forward.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Do you bring a little bit of comic relief?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
That's the one, yeah, comic relief.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Good.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Thanks, can I ask you?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000
If you had to define volunteering, how would you define it?

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
I don't know.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000
I don't get any monetary reward.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
I come along and do what I can.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
That's volunteering.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
And I think I do it because I think if it's worthwhile, I think it was not worthwhile.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
I wouldn't bother.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Although I did, and I did do, I don't know if you want me to go on to another bit of volunteering.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000
I did some volunteering a couple years ago and it was a project, it looked brilliant.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:27.000
It was working with primary school kids and it was specifically shy, withdrawn primary school kids.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Oh, it's lovely.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
I saw the video and all these poor little children, you have to be very careful and bring them out of their shell.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Oh, that's brilliant.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
What did you do with that project?

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Well, I got assigned with three other volunteers and we went to this primary school and ADHD,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000
challenging behaviour problems, I wouldn't put them down as shy little children.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
They were full on.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Which primary school was it?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Yes, I can't remember the name, but it was like towards Llanrhymne here, I think Llanrhymne.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
But the kids were very challenging.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000
And I thought, hang on, you're a big man with a big loud voice, so take it easy.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Let the young women come forward, you know what you're doing.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000
But they ran rings round us and by the time I thought, hang on, time to step forward,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
they were already running the show.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
This is over a period of weeks.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
So in fact that wasn't a good experience.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:44.000
What I'd like to ask actually is if you had to give some advice or words of inspiration

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
to somebody who was interested in volunteering, what would you say?

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Well, give it a go.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Give it a go.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:02.000
I mean in terms of Oasis, I would say give it a go and it's immensely rewarding.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:09.000
The people there, the refugees and the silent seekers are really good hearted people,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
so give it a go.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
But be boundaried because their needs are immense.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
So you could be swallowed up.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
So you need to be careful.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
And in fact I say this to my friends when they come along, you know,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.000
just do, it would be very tempting to get too involved,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
but that's the advice I would give in this project.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Is there anything you'd like to add that we haven't asked to do?

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
No, I don't think so.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
How much do I get paid?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
There's a volunteer as well.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Oh, I thought it was worth a favour.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Get a can of four Polish lagers, strong 5%.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Sorry.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
But thank you very much for your time.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Thank you.
