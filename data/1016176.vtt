00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I went to Butlins and I met up with somebody.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I had to sing a contest anyway, but we just drifted for different reasons.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And do we, Ron, stay together?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Peter Jones, who was with us then playing guitar, beat guitar, he was with him,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and they formed what they called the Westerners, and they persuaded Terry to come and join the sing.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But they called themselves then Edwards and the Arcadians.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
They started off with Terry Edwards, whatever singer.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And they then continued ultimately being the Westerners over the years.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But Terry, a great singer, and he split with them and went up to London.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And Ron took over the vocals.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And I got an LP of them, a CD of them, and I thought to myself,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
no, it's not something I won't buy, or I want a super-rigged one.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's pleasant voice, but not really personality.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Very different to Skiffle, I would imagine.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And the charisma came along, you know, really. And that's how we split.
