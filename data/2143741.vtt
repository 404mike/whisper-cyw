00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
To return to my foster parents, when a Jewish lady doesn't know what to do with a child,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I think every mother is the same, they feed it.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So she put all this food in front of me, and I mean I hadn't eaten a meal for God knows how long,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
the meal, you know, a meal in the orphanage was sour milk with sugar and cinnamon, that was a meal.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And she was very distressed because I just couldn't eat this food, which was so foreign to me.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I possibly nibbled on a bread, I mean it's about all I could cope with.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And I could see her getting more and more upset, but there was nothing I could do about it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Anyway, I think we both gave in, and I went to bed.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You have to understand that this lady at 50 had never had children, had no idea how to treat a child.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Next day, I'd never been to a hairdresser, I'd never had my hair cut, my plaits had saved my life many times.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The first thing she did, she took me to a hairdresser, had my plaits cut off.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And the second thing she did, my second name was Kerry.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And in Germany I had known no other name, I was always Kerry, and she didn't like it.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So she decided to choose my other name, which was Ellen.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I had never ever been called Ellen, so every time she'd called me I didn't answer.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Every time I looked in the mirror, I'm looking at a stranger.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
My plaits have gone, my name has gone.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I'm a complete stranger amongst strangers.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I can't talk to them, I can't explain to them how I feel, because I have no English and they have no German.
