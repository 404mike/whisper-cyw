People from the various communities in the Vale of Glamorgan have been given nicknames.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:12.940
Llanthwaite people are called Wennowantings. People from Cowbridge are called Call-again-tomorrows,

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:20.940
whilst those from Wick are called the Frolics. The Wennowanting story arises from a number

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:27.940
of Llanthwaite men who went to Cowbridge one day, about thirteen in number. They caroused

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:37.860
and enjoyed themselves, though they were supposed to be there at the market. When they met to

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.860
return, they decided that they would count themselves, which they proceeded to do, forgetting

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.860
to count themselves. So there were only twelve. When this was pointed out to people, they

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:01.060
each tried in turn, and each time they came to twelve and not thirteen, because they forgot

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:10.060
to count themselves. They made their way back, feeling very sorry for themselves having lost

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.060
one of their friends. But when it was pointed out when they returned to Llanthwaite that

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:24.060
they were indeed thirteen, they looked very silly. And that is the story behind the Wennowantings.
