It's Stephen Cruz, a Cultural Heritage Volunteer for the Ellen Lynx Project. I'm here at the Royal

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:13.280
Welsh Show today on the 24th of July 2023 and I'm talking to... Mike James. Mike, I overheard you

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.440
talking to Cath about where you used to live. Could you tell me a little bit more about that?

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:28.880
Yeah, I lived in Ryder. I grew up in Ryder from 1973. I think I was there for about 13 or 14 years.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Do you remember Ryder?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.640
The fact, I think, that the people were very welcoming. In those days it was a smaller community than it is now.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:53.280
As a family we got involved in the local organizations, the Male Voice Choir for example.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.760
My dad was a conductor there for a while.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It was a big change for me. I was 12 or 13 when we moved there. I spent the formative years in London.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.040
So it was quite a big shock, big change. But I still come back. Every year I come back to Ryder.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.040
You have to. I need my fix regularly.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.040
Where did you go to school in Ryder?

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:35.280
Initially I went to school at Llandrindah. After a year or so my brother and I went away to school across the border in Herefordshire.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.280
What sort of activities did you get up to as a young boy?

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.280
Swimming in the river, fishing. I did do a bit of fishing but it was never very successful.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:55.520
All sorts. Cycling, you know. I don't know.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.520
What about the actual building that you grew up in? That's a bit special.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.520
Yes. Mum and Dad moved up to Ryder and they bought the Ellen Hotel on West Street.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:17.760
I had an aunt who was living in Ryder at the time. Her husband was a pharmacist in Ryder.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.760
His name was Ron Davis. She was Dillis Davis.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.760
They'd heard that the hotel was for sale. Mum and Dad were looking around at the time.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Later on in 1973 we moved up here.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:48.000
It was full on hard work for them for the next 13 years running the hotel.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
What other shops in Ryder do you remember?

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.240
Now they've changed a lot. Let's have a think.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.240
There was the butchers on the corner, collards.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:12.240
There was, which isn't there any longer, part of the castle now was a fresh fish shop on North Street.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.240
Before the electrical shop was in North Street there was the Kimberley which was a cafe.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.480
There was the shoe shop which was on West Street.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:32.480
There was the outfitters. There was a big post office then also on West Street.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.480
A lot more pubs then than there were now. I think there were 13 pubs in Ryder at the time.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.480
That number has gone down quite a lot since then.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.480
Do you remember any of your contemporaries from your time?

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.720
Yes, still keep in touch with some of them.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.720
I've been up here for the last week and I've caught up with a few.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.720
You'll walk about town now, this many years later and people still recognise me.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.720
Which is surprising.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.720
Well as you said at the beginning, Ryder has a real community feel to it doesn't it?

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.720
Very much so.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.960
I just love coming up here, I love going up the Ellum Valley.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.960
It's somewhere I have to go when I'm up here.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.960
I've been up this last week and two or three times I've been up cycling up there and driving around.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.960
Have you noticed many changes up there?

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.960
It's certainly not as busy as it used to be.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.200
Yes, there are a lot more people cycling up there and that sort of thing.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:51.200
Back in the 70s people used to go up there sightseeing and there used to be coach loads of tourists going around.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:57.200
A lot of them used to stop at the Ellum Hotel for teas and coffees.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.200
But I think coach holidays are not as popular now as they used to be.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.440
But that brought a lot of business into the town.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.440
I was going to say, I was talking to the guy who used to own the Metropole who's now died.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.440
And he said that a year after Margaret Thatcher came in, the whole tourist trade died.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.440
So you used to get tail backs from Crossgate into Ryder of cars going to go up the valley.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:39.680
And he said, with the advent of that brand of conservatism, a lot of the heavy industries in the Midlands closed.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.680
And people couldn't afford the holidays and they didn't come over.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.680
And he said it was really sudden and they just bought the hotel at Devil's Bridge when the trade stopped.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.680
Thank you, Catherine.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.680
So is there anything else that you'd like to mention about Ryder?

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.920
Not off the top of my head, other than I'll always be back.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.920
Good. That's wonderful. Thanks very much for your time today.
