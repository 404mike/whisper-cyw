00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.920
November 1944, Herman Rothman, a German Jewish refugee, has joined the British army and crossed

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.920
the English Channel into Nazi-occupied Europe.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.720
He arrives at Ostend in Belgium.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.480
Almost immediately, we were dive-bombed.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.640
I heard planes coming over, German planes, and starting to dive-bomb the railway station

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.080
or somewhere.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.600
The shock of it was so immense, I can't tell you.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.400
And I said, well, that's war.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.400
That is war.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.480
What I've experienced there was theatre compared with, that is war.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.200
April 1945.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.320
The Western Allied forces have entered Germany.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.040
Welshman William Richard Williams, at the time a captain in the 8th British Army Corps,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:07.640
is tasked with investigating reports of a camp run by the Nazi SS near the town of Bergen.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:17.240
The first indication we had of things not going quite right was when we got up the River

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.240
Aller.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.220
This is where we come to Belsen.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.020
We went through the gate into the camp proper, and it was something which a sight that I

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.700
will never forget.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.340
It was just a series of barbed wire, high barbed wire fences.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.020
There were bundles that looked like rags but turned out to be dead inmates.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:50.780
There were inmates hanging on the wires, fallen beside it, grotesque positions, and you just

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.640
had to pick your way through them.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:04.980
Two were walking and came towards us, and the SS, my escort, just shot them.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.400
As restrictions on enemy aliens were gradually lifted, many German and Austrian refugees

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.920
decided to fight back at the Nazis by enlisting in the British armed forces.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.960
Once the Allies began to liberate German-held territory in 1944 and 1945, the horrific fate

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.040
of those Jews left behind became clear.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.920
I'm Maurice Brodie, historian at Aberystwyth University.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.480
In this final episode of the Holocaust in Wales, we look at tales of liberation and

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.480
of loss.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.420
We hear how Jewish refugees came to Wales to train as they prepared to liberate continental

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.460
Europe.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.140
We listen to Welsh servicemen who witnessed the horrors of the concentration camps.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.500
And we learn about survivors who managed to live through one of the darkest periods in

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.980
human history and ultimately find a home in Wales.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:11.620
Initially, enemy aliens were barred from serving in the regular British armed forces.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.660
They were only allowed to join an auxiliary unit known as the Pioneer Corps.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.740
The Pioneer Corps performed non-combatant tasks like trench-sticking, bridge-building

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.180
and clearing roads.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.500
Herbert Anderson was an Austrian Jew who came to Britain in February 1939.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:38.580
He was classified as a friendly alien at the outbreak of war, which meant he avoided internment.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.660
He joined the Pioneer Corps in early 1940 and was initially stationed in Kent.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:52.900
By the end of that week, we must have been about 200 friendly aliens.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.180
I would think the percentage was as follows.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:05.300
Germany 60%, Austria 25%, other nationals 15%.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:13.580
Denomination-wise it must have been Jewish 70%, non-Jewish 30%.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:23.140
This little refugee army, which grew to a total figure of, I think, 5,000 in the course

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.740
of that year, 1940.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.060
Because it was a non-combatant unit, some aliens were unhappy at being restricted to

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.060
the Pioneer Corps.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.780
George Lane, originally from Hungary, had been accepted to join the Grenadiers, but

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.220
the Home Office found out and ordered his deportation as a friendly alien, since Hungary

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.220
was not then involved in the war.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.260
This order was rescinded, but…

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.900
I was not allowed to join the Grenadiers, I was only allowed to join the Alien Pioneer

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.500
Corps, which made me so angry that I nearly exploded with fury.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:11.940
And for nearly a year I was using a pick and a shovel, doing navy work for the army.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:19.420
I quickly became a sergeant and had the most extraordinary section of mostly German Jews,

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.540
who were very highly educated people, and there we were, you know, using a pick and

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.300
a shovel.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:33.180
Herbert Andersen's unit, the 87th Pioneer Corps, was soon transferred to Pembrokeshire.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:40.060
There was a little village called Angle nearby, where we went to the local pub in the evening,

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.900
but that wasn't the purpose of our being there.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.260
We had to help the Royal Artillery at Manor Beer.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:55.060
That's quite a well-known name in the history of the RAF, because it is used as a place

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.860
where there is target shooting.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:06.420
An RAF plane would drag a target behind and the artillery would have to shoot it down.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.700
And what we had to do was to help the artillery, carrying ammunition.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.260
There were always some secondary jobs.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:23.780
Colin Anson, originally from Berlin, also joined the 87th Pioneer Corps in South Wales.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:30.300
We landed up in a charming place in South Wales called Drwach the Lindray, quartered

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.500
in an old wool mill.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:39.100
We used to go out on Sondre Pioneer Corps duties there, again, what had originally been

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.820
intended – laying mines, laying wire, various things.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:49.660
But another rather charming development was that a band and orchestra were established.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:55.620
This 87th Company band and orchestra used from then on to travel about in South Wales,

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:02.500
giving concerts and playing up for dances in, well, over the whole of the western part

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:09.060
of South Wales, which was great fun and which was doubly agreeable for the members of this

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:14.220
band and orchestra, because we were excused general duties and parades since we tended

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.940
to be out rather late.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:22.620
For Hermann Rothmann, who had lived at Gurech Castle in Abergala in the early part of the

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:28.900
war, maintaining his Jewish identity in the army was important.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.220
Hermann joined the Royal West Kent Regiment in 1944.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:39.820
As I was a religious Jew, I had my twillen with me, you know, which you put on.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.820
I always had these with me, and a small tullis.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:49.900
And I took this always with me, because to me that was important, that I maintained my

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.220
religion.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.580
My belief in God was not shaken in any way.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:02.340
And I think to a certain extent, if you believe in God, that you have got somebody to fall

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:11.380
back on and to pray, and that perhaps is also a lift, which is natural, which is important

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:19.300
to you, to sustain, to be alive and to want to be, to not give in.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.860
Other soldiers had to shun their Jewish heritage for the cause.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:30.360
In 1942, a unit of commandos was created, composed almost entirely of German-speaking

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.900
Jewish refugees.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:38.540
They were to carry out operations behind enemy lines, and as such needed to keep their identities

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.260
a secret.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:45.580
George Lane was involved in the recruitment of what became known as X-Trip, whose base

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.860
was in the foothills of Errari, Snowdonia.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:54.460
He was charged with finding suitable billets for the troops.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:59.220
So I went to Harlech, and I went straight to the police station.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:04.660
I explained that I had a commando troop and I had to find billets for them.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.980
And they said, oh, there are plenty of empty rooms, don't you worry, it's a perfectly

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.700
easy matter, come with us.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:17.700
You see, so with Constable Jones, I went all over Harlech, he knocked on the door, he said,

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.700
Mrs. Jones, listen to the captain.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.100
So I explained, you know.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.540
Mrs. Jones then said, how much they're going to pay?

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:29.820
So I said, well, the War Office gives us two pounds, actually, the allowance for that.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:30.820
Two pounds a week?

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.160
After a question, go away.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.100
So then Constable Jones intervened and said, well, you've got to have them.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:41.540
You've got an empty room and you should be proud of it that you're going to have a commando

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.900
or two.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.820
So we found billets for a lot of them.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:51.180
But I had a really sleepless night because I thought these women are going to be perfectly

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.220
ghastly to my chaps.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.460
And I had no idea what to do.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.060
Well, I needn't have worried.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:05.580
I walked down the main street the day after my chaps arrived and these women came out

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:12.420
to their houses and they said, Captain, why didn't you tell us they were not English?

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.700
We would have had them for nothing.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.580
Alison Williams lived in Aberdovey in Gwynedd.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.660
Her family housed two ex-stripped commandos during the war.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:28.340
One of them was Kurt Meyer, who took the pseudonym Peter Moody.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.760
She remembers his time in the village.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:35.480
He was a very gentle chap, very tall, very, very clever.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:41.160
And actually he and my father, you see, they'd be working all day or whatever and then they'd

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.800
come back to the house.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:48.800
Now then just bear in mind we didn't have electricity, so it was only gas and or candles.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.960
And then they'd be playing drafts then and they'd be at it until about two o'clock in

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.960
the morning.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:00.200
And my mother would say, well, Moody, you need to go because you'll be on duty before

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.920
long, you know.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:08.040
Because he was, Mr Evans, I'm determined to beat you at this game.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.360
He never did.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:16.640
Colin Anson joined ex-troop after becoming bored with life in the Pioneer Corps.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:21.120
He remembers his time at Aberdovey as much more rigorous.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.820
The training obviously was very interesting.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:31.400
Ours was perhaps more angled towards the intelligence side with expeditions to North Wales, the

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:37.160
Snowdonia area for mountain climbing training, rock climbing training.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:43.000
Even if you only perhaps were going to have an intelligence lecture or compass reading

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.560
practice, map reading or what have you, you'd first double up a mountain in order to do

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:52.440
it and then double down again and round the other side when you had finished.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:58.320
So we were brought up to and kept at a certain stage of fitness.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:05.000
Eventually, training finished and refugees were thrust into action in Europe.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:12.360
For those ex-troop commandos operating behind enemy lines, capture was a very serious matter.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:19.320
In 1942, Hitler secretly issued the Commando Order, stating that all Allied commandos captured

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.640
by the Germans were to be shot without trial.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:29.280
George Lane was captured following a reconnaissance mission near Calais in May 1944.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:34.640
He managed to convince his captors that he was a lost Navy casualty, disguising his Hungarian

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.760
roots by putting on his best Welsh accent.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.040
They were just very unpleasant, telling me every five minutes that I'm going to be shot

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.080
and hanged because it was obvious that I was a saboteur.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:53.480
And although the interrogators spoke better English than I did, I managed to get away

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.200
with it by pretending to be a Welshman.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.720
And I went on talking like a Welshman all the time, you know, and because we did all

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.480
our training in North Wales and it was, I wasn't deaf in those days, it was much more

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.480
in my ear.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.480
I don't know what I sound like now because I'm too deaf.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:16.380
But then it sounded all right and they did not detect my Hungarian accent.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:22.660
The Allies may have been closing in on German-held territory, but for Jews trapped in these countries,

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.260
life was becoming unimaginably grim.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:32.180
Eva Klein, who moved to Cardiff after the war, was a Hungarian Jew coerced into becoming

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:37.340
a forced labourer by the Nazis and their Hungarian collaborators.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:43.140
She and her family were initially moved to the De Bretsen ghetto and in 1944 were forced

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.900
aboard a train to Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:53.900
The railway line, however, was bombed and the train was redirected to Austria.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:14:03.580
When the deportation started, we were put in cattle cars, 70, 80 people in one, one

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:07.700
bucket for that many people.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:11.060
It didn't matter who saw you, who didn't.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:15.540
But if you have to go, you have to go and you had to do it.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:19.020
You could hardly stand because it was no room.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:24.980
People were standing on the top of each other.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:29.380
When we arrived, some dead, some alive.

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:35.760
They just threw out the dead ones and they didn't know where to go.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:42.360
In Vienna, Eva and her family were forced to work clearing rubble from bombed out buildings.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:50.400
They were bringing in the frame from the bombs, which were in wooden frames, and we had to

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.520
chop them up for firewood.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.960
That's what we did.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.520
This was my main work.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:08.480
And then with this firewood to fill up lorries and sacks of coals, we were sitting on the

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:18.880
top of the sacks in freezing cold weather and we had to schlep sacks of coals 30 kilo

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.000
in one sack.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.240
That was our job.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:31.400
In April 1945, the British 11th Armoured Division arrived at a camp complex near the town of

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.440
Bergen in northern Germany.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:40.520
Bergen-Belsen was built as a prisoner of war camp, but over time became used as a concentration

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:45.000
camp for tens of thousands of Jews.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.400
Conditions in the camp were hellish.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.240
Starvation and typhus decimated the population.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:56.280
Welsh Rabbi Leslie Hardman was the first Jewish pastor to enter the camp two days

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.680
after its liberation.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:03.480
It stank a hell of a roll right to the high heavens.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.680
The smell was abominable.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:14.600
And then suddenly moved a little further and I see the hundreds of thousands of dead bodies.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.560
And then in the middle of the camp there was a...

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.680
It was higher than this room.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:28.360
Shoes and shoes and boots and spectacles and other bits of things.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:36.120
And then all the lice and the other things were eating into the leather etc.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:42.360
And this is how they were told to march around whilst the Nazis were in power.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:47.000
The people had to walk around this terrible scene.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.080
And should they try to turn their heads away they were beaten up by the SS.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:58.200
William Richard Williams from Cardiff was one of the first British soldiers to witness

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.680
the liberation of Bergen-Belsen.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:07.960
We went further on into the camp and see these corpses lying everywhere.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.720
You didn't know whether they were living or dead.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.240
Most of them were dead.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:16.600
Some were trying to walk, some were stumbling, some on hands and knees.

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:25.640
But in the lagers, the barbed wire around the huts, you could see that the doors were open.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.880
The stench coming out of them was fearsome.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:36.840
They were lying in the doorways trying to get down the stairs and fall and just died on the spot.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:42.480
Eva Klein escaped en route to Mauthausen concentration camp in Upper Austria,

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:47.680
but was recaptured and sent to Theresienstadt in Czechoslovakia.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:52.080
The Red Army liberated the camp in May 1945.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:56.080
And even then we didn't really believe it was the end of the war.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.000
They said it was.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.440
But we were still in this place.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.640
We couldn't go anywhere.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.240
We couldn't go out at all.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:09.240
We couldn't even go to the yard.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:16.120
On entering Bergen-Belsen, the immediate tasks for the Allies, including William Richard Williams,

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:22.440
were to arrange for food and medical care for the survivors and to bury the dead.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:30.680
I think one of the more horrific sites at that time was where some of the bodies couldn't be

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:37.920
moved manually and had to be literally bulldozed along the ground into the pit.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.680
This, I think, was...

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:45.360
I think we all believe that there should be dignity in death.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:51.280
And I think this was the one aspect of the clear up which perhaps...

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.360
Well, it couldn't have been handled any other way.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:57.360
There was no human way which could have been done except this.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:02.760
But it was one of the more horrific, I think, sites of that camp.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:08.040
Leslie Hardman officiated at the funerals of thousands of inmates at a time.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:12.600
He recited the Kaddish, a Jewish funeral prayer.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.840
We tried to do it for every single one.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.960
When I did the first burial, the second burial, through 5,000 bodies,

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:24.040
some of the inmates came to stand by me.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.240
And they used to comfort one another.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.520
They said, look, at least your brother, your sister, our friends here,

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:36.840
at least a religious service, what we call a Yiddish word, is being mentioned over the graves.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.440
We don't know whether our mothers and fathers are.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.840
They're probably just fertilising the ground of the Polish fields.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.720
Most of them were burnt, destroyed.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.120
So they used to comfort one another.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.320
I said, some kind of service.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.080
Survivors tried to rebuild their lives as best they could.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:20:00.680
Eva Klein returned to Hungary, but had no word of the fate of two of her brothers.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:04.320
Some people came to look for my eldest brother,

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:10.960
whom they met in Mauthaus in Gunsgatien, and they couldn't imagine why he is not home yet.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:18.960
He had typhoid, and I think he died the last day of the war,

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.520
or when they were liberated.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:29.520
But Soltán, the other brother, he was in the Russian camps.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:35.520
As they said, he disappeared. He disappeared with the other few hundred thousands.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:46.320
Six million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:52.400
They died in concentration camps like Bergen-Belsen and Theresienstadt.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:58.000
They died in death camps like Auschwitz-Birkenau and Treblinka.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.800
They were gassed, shot, starved, and succumbed to diseases like typhoid.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:13.000
They were murdered for no other reason than because they were Jews.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:19.200
In this podcast, we have explored the connections between the Holocaust and Wales.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.680
We have listened to the stories of refugees who found sanctuary in Wales,

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:27.280
and the terrors from which they fled.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:32.080
The Holocaust did not just happen to other people in another place and time.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.200
It is part of all of our history.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:40.280
By studying this history, we ensure that victims are not forgotten,

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:46.760
and hope to prevent the horrors of the Holocaust from ever being repeated.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.760
Thank you for listening.
