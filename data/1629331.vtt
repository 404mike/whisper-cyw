you know the guns who the bird colonies you know they were

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.640
you know the trick then in those days was to reverse the boaters deep into the bird colonies

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.600
when they were all on the ledges blow the horn and watch them all fly off

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.680
really yeah no it was literally they get I remember being on the air more six and they'd get it so

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.960
that the you know on a calm day there's literally about a foot either side of the stern going right

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.640
back into the cave and then you know just hammer the throttle and blow the horn at the same time

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.680
whatever you know and everyone would look at them wow not realizing all the sort of chicks that were left you know there'd be

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.240
a percentage picked away by the blackback girls or whatever in the chaos or whatever whatever you know

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.760
the damage that would have been done eggs rolling off who knows you know
