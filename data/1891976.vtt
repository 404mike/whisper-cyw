Well, for the majority of, I mean, we weren't, not all the boys were Orthodox, so to speak.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And although in the hostel everything was very Orthodox, not only, not only food-wise, but also in every, in life.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000
There were prayers in the morning, there were prayers in the evening, there were prayers after meals, St. Grace after meals.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.000
But not all the boys were brought up in that way, really.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:58.000
But one thing which was important, of course, was, you know what kosher is, kosher food, which is important, or was important.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And it was strange for anyone who was used to having everything kosher to be in a non-Jewish home and not being able to partake.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:32.000
But the people who sponsored us, which were the communities I mentioned before, arranged to have kosher food sent down.
