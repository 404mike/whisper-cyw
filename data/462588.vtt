00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280
I didn't quite realise at the time, but apparently my godmother, this was down in London, my

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:15.280
godmother thought we were going over to her home and they'd managed to, because they

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:23.760
were in business, they'd managed to acquire quite a large screen TV.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:32.720
And my mother said, no, no, we were stopping at home because my grandparents, her parents,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.120
were coming down to London to be in London for the coronation.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:49.160
They were coming from Hartlepool on the North East Coast and my maternal grandma in particular

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:57.160
was quite keen on royalty, partly because we were 14 miles out of London and she thought

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:05.160
that was near neighbours to Buckingham Palace.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.600
So yes, we watched the coronation as a family group.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:20.040
There was my grandma and grandpa hood, my mother and my young sister and myself.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:30.440
My father was away at sea, but then he usually was.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:39.480
I don't remember a great deal about actually watching it.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:50.280
I could say I remember the Archbishop of Canterbury with the crown poised lower on

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.720
the Queen's head.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:02.120
But there's so many pictures of that, that mightn't be right.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:14.320
I do remember my godmother organising my mum and me to go with her and her daughter who's

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.000
just a year or two younger than me and we were to go up to London and look at all the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.560
decorations.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.520
Now, this must have been a bit later.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.120
And I can remember this taxi going round the coronation route and Wendy and I not being

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.120
in the least bit interested.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.520
Much more interested in whatever storybook we got with us that was to keep us quiet on

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.520
the train journey.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.520
Tell you what I do remember about coronation on the actual day.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:04.020
Queen Salotti of Tonga with the carriage down and that pouring rain and this large lady

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.520
waving to the crowds and being so thrilled with the rain.
