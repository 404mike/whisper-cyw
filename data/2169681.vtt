00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Going semi nautical.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Nowadays hybrid vehicles are very fashionable, but our hybrid was very much ahead of its time, and in all honesty it probably still would be.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This was a hybrid cabin cruiser boat stroke caravan made of fibreglass on a metal chassis with two wheels and an inboard petrol jet engine.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Allegedly the idea of a marine architect in Nottingham launched on an unsuspecting public in 1973, which was the era of hovercrafts and amphicars, and according to legend the subject of a disastrous PR exercise at the launch.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The story goes that due to the strength of the river flow and the lack of power in the engine, a party of local dignitaries, including the mayor, had to be rescued to avoid being swept over a weir, risking drowning.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It is said that only some sixty odd were made before the embarrassed inventors smashed up the moulds, and yes we bought one.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:18.000
In my defence I would say a. It was cheap. b. I'd only owned a rowing boat on our pond up to this acquisition. c. We already had a camper van and this seemed a logical development.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
d. When sanity prevailed after only a bit of cleaning I sold it for a £500 profit.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So how did this come about? Blame the internet.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We were out for a day in Sussex near Boldune Castle, not far from our home, went on a river near the pub garden where we were having lunch, we saw a sweet little cabin cruiser.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Someone in the bar commented it was used by a local minister who sailed between two churches. I was never able to establish the truth of this but was entranced by the idea of a small river boat, probably another Toad of Toad haul moment.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.000
A trawl of the classifiers of boats for sale came up with a caro boat for sale and restoration on the River Trent near Nottingham.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:29.000
A subsequent internet search revealed an active caro boat owner's forum, complete with helpful hints on restoration and seductive photos of comfy interiors with kitchens and adaptable sofa beds and folding tables of the sort we were familiar with from our caravans and camper van.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Coincidentally we were due to stay with a friend not far away from the River Trent so I took the plunge and phoned the owner.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:48.000
He said it was moored on the river and described it as a partial restoration project but if we went to see it and we were still interested he could arrange delivery to the south of England.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Some days later we found ourselves on the banks of the River Trent viewing the abandoned boat in rarity.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:06.000
The seller was not available but had sent some photos to help us locate it and recognise it although recognition wasn't so much just a problem as there was nothing else like it.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It wasn't moored on an official jetty but tethered to a tree and although afloat we could see water and god knows what else inside it.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So back at home I found myself a few days later phoning the owner and saying having seen it we were still interested but would getting it to East Sussex present any problems and what would it cost us?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.000
This would be no problem and he had someone who could deliver as he wasn't available as it was his busy season.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.000
This would be for an all-in price of £250 delivered and we would become the new owners and the boat would be brought to Sussex.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I then made the mistake of asking what he did that made him so busy in the summer. The reply shocked me.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I'm a professional clown he said with a certain amount of undisguised pride.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
We bought a boat with wheels full of water and mud some 200 plus miles away from a clown.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I spent the next few days before the agreed delivery date researching things caraboked.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.000
The small group of owners were a helpful resource about the history of the craft and hints and details about the restoration process.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
One enthusiast even sent me a DVD of the restoration process of his own craft.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
All of these made me even keener for our own dream boat to arrive.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:37.000
There was a rather curious phone call from the clown's friend also known as the delivery man the day before the agreed date.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
We should have set some alarm bells ringing.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I'm planning to leave Nottingham very early tomorrow morning so should be with you around nine-ish?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Great no problem you have the email with local directions for our house you can always phone when nearby and I can direct you.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Yes thanks I have one question are you south or north of London?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:08.000
A little shocked I explained East Sussex was south of London and described the junction number they would need to leave the M25 from.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Yes I've heard of the M25 is it a motorway?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I'm sure we'll find you see you tomorrow morning and he was gone.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I cynically commented that it sounded like our boat vendor had recruited one of the other clowns from the circus for the delivery but I hoped I was joking.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:43.000
The next morning nine o'clock came and went so did ten o'clock and eleven o'clock and I eagerly listened to the twelve o'clock radio news bulletin to see if there were any reports of a shutdown of any southbound carriageways on the motorway network.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Due to a hybrid boat caravan vehicle incident at last around 12.30 the phone went hello it's Bob delivering your boat is taking longer than I thought.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:04.000
We've been over the large bridge and through the toll tunnel and now we see the signs to the airport is that near you we forgot to bring our road atlas.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Signs to Gatwick airport you need to leave the M25 at the junction for the A21 sign posted to Hastings.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
No the airport's Stansted.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
What are you going north?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
But we can't be we crossed the Thames on the bridge.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Yes but somehow you crossed it again by using the tunnel.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I don't know how did you leave the motorway somewhere after the bridge?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000
There were some roadworks and we all got a bit confused I don't really know so we don't go to Stansted Airport then?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000
No you need to turn off at the next junction and come back onto the motorway to go south.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Inspiration kicked in.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Is it sunny there? It is here.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
You need to go south towards the sun.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Call again when you leave the motorway and you are on the A21 and I'll drive out and look for you and lead you back.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
The plan seemed to have a flaw as far as the clown driver was concerned.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Yes but how will I recognise you?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
You won't need to. I will spot you.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
There won't be any other caravoats being towed on the English road network today.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I'm prepared to risk that.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
I cheered myself up by imagining the scenes in the rooms where the motorway cameras are monitored.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
There's that weird caravan boat thing again.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Or maybe there's another of those weird boat caravan things.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
That's the third or fourth one I've seen today. Never seen one before.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:41.000
I was phoned to be told the deliverers were now on the A21 and still have their controls set for the heart of the sun just like the early Pink Floyd release.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:50.000
I left for the planned interception leaving the gate to the drive open to allow the Hope Fork vehicle trailer boat caravan even unto rival

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and hoping to avoid a multiple vehicle boat trailer caravan shunt while I stopped to open the gate on my return.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
The rendezvous went surprisingly smoothly.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
The car trailer caravan boat combination was spotted by me from the lay-by where I parked

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and phoned to confirm I was able to overtake on the next straight and lead them the few miles back home.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
After the drama of the preceding few hours the drop off was straightforward

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and the delivery man left refusing our offer of refreshment and before I could pluck up the courage to confirm his clown credentials.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.000
We were now the proud owners of a caravan boat restoration project including the generous helping of River Trent mud

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
which covered the floor and some of the lower walls of the cabin.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
For the first few weeks the activity was restricted to clearing out the mud

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
and generally cleaning off the dirt and mould so we could have a proper look at the task ahead.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
I've copied below into the book some original brochures from the early 1970s

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:00.000
which together with other material from the enthusiasts of the Carapodones group had spurred us on with the restoration.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Next using a jet washer we were able to strip off the green paint to reveal the yellow self-coloured fibreglass

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
and the remnants of an old name transfer giving the craft the glorious name of Hippo

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
which seemed to accurately fit its top heavy bulbous form.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:26.000
The jet wash and the volume of water at least proved that the hull was watertight as it needed to dry out or be bailed out.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
The original brochure and restoration DVD showed a large expanse of glass

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000
but most of the panels had been replaced on ours by either plywood or frosted glass.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Taking a piece of ply out of one of the panels towards the front or bow as us boat owners call it

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000
revealed the aluminium frame to be in good condition once the mast stick was laboriously scraped out.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
We found that cleaning and restoring the upper part of the boat or caravan to be possible for us

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
but the restoration hints from other owners suggested reinstalling the tow bar

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and arranging a secure fitting for the necessary outboard motor

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000
plus arranging the controls to be placed near the bow to be quite a specialised task.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:20.000
On top of this was the question of the wheels and drum brakes necessary for the caravan or boat to be towed.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
This was definitely work for another day.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
We already had fitted out our VW camper van with a camping interior

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000
comprising storage cupboards, a rock and roll convertible bed, sink with pumped water,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
a small gas cooker and fridge, plus folding seats and tables.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
So the interior fittings were felt to be within our skill set.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
I'm not sure what it was that exactly brought our plans for restoration to a halt.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Maybe I have insufficient nautical aspirations.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Apart from a few ferry trips, a couple of dinghy sailing trips with friends and some windsurfing lessons,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
my water-going experiences mostly like the London power station, Bankside.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000
It may have been a commitment to the country garden of a few acres that occupied much of our free time.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Coupled with ownership I'd already had of two other motoring rarities and keeping them running,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000
namely the 66 VW split screen and the 73 Volvo 1800.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Having come to a decision about abandoning the project, the next task was to sell it.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Although the caravote owners forum had been a welcome source of information,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
it seemed that for all of them the ownership of one caravote was sufficient.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Maybe their own trials and tribulations of restoration and ownership had also deterred their friends,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
or maybe they were so eccentric to not have any friends, who knows.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000
The conclusion was to put it on eBay, although there was some debate which category to use,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
boat, caravan or caravan-boat. I think I must have used both.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Not surprisingly it was the only one on there, worldwide.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Deciding not to be greedy I put it up with an opening bid at the price I'd bought it for, £150.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
I was recently experienced in using eBay, both for buying and selling,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
so I wasn't surprised that I didn't receive any bids for the first half of the week,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
but I was pleasantly surprised how many viewings it got in the high hundreds.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
There was also a healthy number of watchers, over 50 after four days,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
but I'm sure many of these clicked on to watch to show their partner or colleague later,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
who may have dismissed a verbal description as to some type of hallucination.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Still, whatever happened, at least we wouldn't have to wrap it up.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.000
I mentioned this as I had around the same time unwisely expressed some outrage

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
at a Sussex auction house that had severely disappointed an elderly friend of a friend

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
by selling a large and precious to her bone china dinner service

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and then achieving a grand total for her after commission of some £30.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Our friend Yvonne was so upset on her behalf, particularly as she was contemplating

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
doing the same with her Royal Dalton service that she'd collected over the years,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000
but admitted it would break her heart to get so little for something she'd collected at far greater expense.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
I'd rashly said that I believed it would be much more profitable to list it piecemeal on eBay,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
where collectors could add to their collections.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
The commitment made that followed a programme of photographing dozens of pieces

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and inputting individual listings of tea plates, gravy boats and serving dishes and a whole lot more.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
This was followed by some exciting end of auction bidding

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000
and Yvonne's joy at the idea that two of her dinner plates were after Canada or Holland.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
The most onerous part was the wrapping parties that seemed to take hours

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000
and a lot of bubble wrap, but it was all worth it when the auctions netted over £350 for her.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
There was a poignant moment when she said that although she was pleased with the sales,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
she wished she'd just kept a couple of things.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Luckily, being experienced in the vagaries of human nature,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:22.000
we'd held back a couple of what I think are called trios, a cup, saucer and a plate, plus a small jug.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
This, she said, was the icing on the cake.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Anyway, there was no way we were keeping any souvenirs of the caravote.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
We'd only just distributed the River Trent Mod in the hedge.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
On the day of the auction end, the number of views and watchers escalated again

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000
and by the time we sat down to watch the last 20 minutes before it ended, with the glass each to calm us,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
the numbers kept climbing and new bids came in.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:55.000
At first it climbed slowly, 160, 165, 175, 200.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
There may be some of the bidders who were also fortified with drinks.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:08.000
The bid started to climb in £50 increments with a last-minute flurry during the 30-second countdown to achieve £750.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Brilliant!

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
The following week the buyer arrived and it was trailing back to the Midlands.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
It was going home.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Out of curiosity, I googled caravote at the time of writing this and one had been offered in 2020 for completion at offers around £3,500,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
described as one of the last dozen in existence.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Anyone tempted?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Then I found another one that had been restored and at that end the auction unsold,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
but with a starting price of £14,500.
