00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.100
I can see it now. I can see us at the main station called the Hauptbahnhof in Cologne

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:16.700
on the platform getting onto a train. I think it was about three o'clock in the afternoon.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:34.060
My mother was there seeing me onto the train and it was a whole class which was then moving

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:43.700
to England. In fact it was two classes because boys and girls were separate, it wasn't mixed.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:53.740
There must have been, I would say, about 25 boys and I'm not sure about the number of girls,

00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:08.580
but probably the same because very few of the people in that class did not travel at that time.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:17.580
Some parents decided obviously to keep their children there whilst others sort of foresaw

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:27.300
the situation and were happy to see their children go. We had a wonderful journey from Cologne to

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:40.340
Holland to, oh where did we go from now, my memory sometimes fails me with words,

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.900
so always names especially, not so much with words but with names.
