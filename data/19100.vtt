00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
They wanted me 12 year old, they was going earlier but the government stopped that.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.080
Children going under, oh yes.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.800
Yes, I went with my brother.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.200
He was working underground.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.760
And he took me with him.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.120
I went mine indoor but I was very nervous, never experienced anything like it.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.000
And horses used to be flying through with their trams.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.040
I'd open the door when they'd come in and shut it after I opened the ventilation.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:41.560
The ventilation had to go around a certain part of the workings for the men to work and live.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:48.480
Well it frightened me as a boy, you see, I wasn't as lonely by myself as I didn't like it.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.880
So my brother took me with him to work for a man as he was working.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.680
And that's where I started on the call first.
