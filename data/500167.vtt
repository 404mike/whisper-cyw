00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.840
I was five years old when my parents moved to Glyn Terrace. I was an only child and I

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:25.360
was told that they were moving house because I was going to have a baby brother or sister.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:33.880
I didn't really want to leave Trevallies Cossages but I soon settled in to Glyn Terrace

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:40.480
and found it was a delightful place to live. There were plenty of playmates there. Most

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:49.880
of the people in the terrace spoke Welsh and when I think of it, how lovely it was here.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:57.400
The children had the freedom of the mountains. We played in the stream. There was one boy,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:05.000
Alan Thomas, who lived just down the road. His favourite hobby was trying to catch the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:16.520
fish in the stream. He'd put his hand under the stones and pulled the trout out. I always

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.920
went to pick bilberries. All the children picked bilberries and I knew when I picked

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:32.000
bilberries there would be bilberry pie for tea the following day. Sometimes my father,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.640
after a day's work, used to say we'd go pick bilberries and so he used to pick a lot.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:49.480
I didn't pick all that many but it was lovely going up on the hills. I also picked firewood.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:57.560
The children, all the cottages had coal fires and the children went into the woodlands,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:09.880
with a sack and picked the kindling wood and that was a nice occupation. Sometimes we would

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:19.000
see the patients from Pendafrin Hall Sanatorium walking around Pendafrin Woods. It was a delightful

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:33.080
place. Of course we played in the woodland, over the river. The green was lovely there.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:41.960
The boys played football and the girls ran around there. It was altogether a delightful

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:53.080
place to live. And then the war came and the evacuees arrived from Liverpool. They thought

00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:04.080
it was a wonderful place after Liverpool. The children, it mixed in with the other children

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:14.200
very well. The children from Liverpool were mainly Roman Catholics but we all played together.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:25.200
The local children went down to the Sunday school, Glanaravon. We walked down the stream

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:33.400
path on a Sunday afternoon. Sometimes on a Sunday morning I went to church in my best

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:40.400
clothes and then I came home at lunch time and I put on my best clothes for a short time

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:47.600
in case I got my best clothes dirty. Then I dressed up again to go to Sunday school

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:56.800
in the afternoon. The Sunday school teacher was Bob Thomas from Glanaravon. It was a well

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.200
attended Sunday school and there were several teachers there. I was in the class that sat

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.200
on the big wooden bench in Glanaravon. In the winter Glanaravon schoolroom was lovely

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:21.800
and warm. The caretaker Ethel Jones made a fire in the old black stove and heated the

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.400
room up before the children arrived. It was a very happy Sunday school and of course there

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:39.300
was the Perks Sunday school Christmas party. Then in the summer there was the annual trip

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:46.300
to Rill, to the Marine Lake mainly. We all loved going around on the equipment in the

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:54.300
Marine Lake and especially the ghost train. It was a wonderful day out, a treat, especially

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.300
so during the war years.
