00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Down Bills Road opposite, you know, Dufferin Farm on the sort of long straight,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000
across the river from there, I don't recall it, but I think it's demolished and fell into ruin.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Woodlands, it's a ruin now, isn't it?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Well, no, I think all the stone was taken to build other things.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I remember seeing it on Facebook and Jimmy Thomas had made a comment about he remembered it.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
He could walk down past the Thoughall Farm, down the river, and he'd come to it there.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It's sort of what was listed in it.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But he remembers it as a ruin.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The stone gradually disappeared as people just went and helped themselves.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I remember reading in one of the old archives.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It's something that came off the computer anyway.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
About Woodlands, and one of the vikars lived there.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
One of the former vikars of Kandida Church, I think.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I don't know whether it was used as a vicarage.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
This wouldn't be far from Kandida because you'd walk up that side of the river

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and you wouldn't be far from the church, actually.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It's probably within half a mile to the church, perhaps.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Would that be used as a vicarage, do you think?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
It looks as though it would be.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
It looks a bit that way, doesn't it?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It's a lovely looking house. It's got some really big chimneys on it.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Amazing chimneys, aren't they?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Yes.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Have you ever heard of that Woodlands?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I've never known it as a charter. It's sort of gone by then, I think.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
No, I don't remember it, I don't think.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I've seen that as well.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The Fleece Temperance Hotel.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I remember it as the electricity board shop.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
That's the archway there to the T-Morgans.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So we're going down South Street.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
That's it, yeah. It looks so wide, doesn't it, here?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The Fleece. It looks so narrow now.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It's where the Fleece was.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Yes, and it's the shop window now, the big shop window.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It was the electricity board place, I don't remember it as a kid.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And this is just the house. And then Lees Hubbard is there on the end.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Well, that's where you started off Married Life, didn't you?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
It was, yeah.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So which is this house then with all the ivy on?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Well, I just can't remember the name right now.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Look at those lovely lamps as well. They're amazing.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Nice and little gas lit.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
But the street looks wide. I can't see the side of it, but it just looks like a...

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Wide street, isn't it? Not wide now, is it?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It's a very small pavement, of course, yeah.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
But the way they're dressed.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Yeah, all the kids, don't they?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
But there are quite a few Temperance Hotels in Raider, because the Kimberley was one.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
That's where you lived, wasn't it? Which is now Walton's, the...

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
That's it, yeah. It used to be the Kimberley Temperance Hotel.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Yeah.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I just remember going down there, there was nine bedrooms there.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And it used to be freezing cold up there.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Freezing cold? Maybe that's why they called it the Temperance Hotel.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
But it was only... they were like coal fired.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Even when you had heating and coal, it just sort of...

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
But there were a lot of Temperance Hotels. There was one next to the old Swan.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
There was one in West Street there.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
My mother used to say they were catered for a lot of people coming into town.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Farmers and the like would come into town for affairs.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
They would come by foot and they would stay the night before going back.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So would that be where...

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
So there was a lot of trade for small places like this.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Would that be where the health food shop is now then?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
It's next to the Swan.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Yeah, that's right, yes, yes.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So what was the name of that one, I wonder?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Well, I don't know. I know the name of that one.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
There are old photographs of it.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
There's an engraving of it with a big sloping roof on it.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I've seen pictures of it.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Right. You don't really associate Raider with the Temperance Hotels.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Well, you don't really. No, actually no.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
It's quite a contradiction to the image you've got with the old pubs.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
They were... I don't know, maybe 26, 30 pubs.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Amazing, yes.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Yes, that's right.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
They've got their Williams.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So where was that? What street was that?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Well, that's the B.I. that is.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Ah, right, right.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
That's a nice old photo.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
On the right-hand side, is he going down to his things?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Those were the days when he'd have a watchmaker.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
There was lots of people...

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Necessary trade.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Yeah, everybody had a clock and they were sort of...

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
There was a trade in maintenance of those, I guess.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Just look at the roof and those little door and windows.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I mean, they've all at least gone, haven't they?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
They have, yes.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Look at the B.I.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
The new B.I. was built in 1900, I think,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
at the time the dams were about being built.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Such a nice big brick building now.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
This was...

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Do you want to read it?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Yeah.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
That's in Bridge Street.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
The railway in.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I guess that was done, I guess,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
the trade from when the station was going.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
The train came to town.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Would that be one of those tall buildings now

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
as you go down towards the valley on your right-hand side?

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Yes, this is higher up.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
This is on the steep pitch opposite the chapel,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
congregational chapel, just the opposite.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
There were shops higher up.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
There was a little sweet shop next up from there.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
There was a little sweet shop with a wooden door,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
like a stable door.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
So this would have been the railway in,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
not a temperance in, I take it?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
No, that's right. No, I guess not.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
But I guess that's...

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Well, it's fairly near the station.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
The trade came from people coming into town on the train.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Oh, well, we know what that one is, David, don't we?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Walked under that many times.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Yorkey's Bridge, I think.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
That's right, yes.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Obviously that must have been prior to 1962.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
1962, yes.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
When they dismantled the whole thing, presumably.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Did the bridge go then?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Yeah, the bridge went then, I think, pretty soon after that.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I think all this embankment has taken away, really.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I suppose it looks more now like it used to before the bridge.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
It's there now, isn't it?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
No, that's all gone.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
It's sort of, as it is today,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
how it used to be before the railway, I guess, pretty much.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And that's the old mill, of course.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
That's the old mill here. That was another experience.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Oh, now we used to play there.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Yeah, we did.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
A death trap. It's a miracle we survived our childhood, honestly.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
It is, isn't it?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
We just used to play in it. There was no health and safety.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
No, that's right.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Yes, you could walk through, walk down past the mill.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Over the stream at the end, there was a...

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
There was a little bridge, wasn't there?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
There was a little bridge, literally a plank just between two trees, really.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And then that took you onto the far side of the...

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
...of the end of the park, where they were.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Yeah, into the woodlands there, isn't it?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And where the stream came, the stream there,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
came under the railway embankment.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
We used to go through the tunnels.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
It was quite a regular trip.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
We used to end up over that feet usually.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Certainly lots of places to play, weren't there?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Yeah, a great place, yes.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
They widened the bridge, didn't they?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
The rear of the bridge was widened.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
When was that, I wonder?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
I think it was sort of the 1920s, late 20s.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Because they made a new bridge, didn't they, in the 20s?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
That's right, yes. I don't know where that was from.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
This is like the widening scheme I think this was, but the other bridge...

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
You can see some things there that obviously show they're doing something to the bridge.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Yes, yes.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And that's... This is...

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
This big tin shed here, this is at the end.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
This is station pitch here.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
It goes up to the station.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And there's a big concrete mixer.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
This is again part of doing this bridge work, I think.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And this tin shed, which is where number one Chameleon is now,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
is now at Ryder's in the backyard at Ryder's Hardware.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Have it Hardware, isn't it?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
That's right. And it still exists.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And Joe mentioned that, didn't he?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And Ryder's shop was in... opposite this, in Bridgend.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
What was it called, Bridgend?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Bridgend Buildings, I think they're the ones near the...

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
That was where Ryder's shop was.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So Chameleon obviously was built when... in the 30s perhaps?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
The 30s probably, yes.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Between the waters, yes.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
As was Green Gardens, I think.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Well, I mean, I always remember.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
I expect you do.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Oh, look, that shows what they were doing.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
That's it, yes.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And there you can see how narrow it was on that photograph.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
It sort of doubled the width, I think, didn't it?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Oh, gracious.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
So I don't know whether that means it wasn't...

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
like it wasn't a completely new bridge,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
but it was sort of built around the old one, I guess, isn't it?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
There was the little old-fashioned hump bridge years and years ago.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Yes, that's right. This looks like the new one, doesn't it?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
It's very necessary to widen it.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
There's an oil painting by Turner supposedly

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
that shows the old bridge and people beyond it

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
people washing clothes in the river.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Yeah, you see them on plates, don't you?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Ornamental plates.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Yes, I've got a copy of it.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I've printed it on a canvas.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
That's the beehive there.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Which is...

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
You certainly altered those. They're very small, aren't they?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Yes.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Yes, this is...

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Well, that's where Hughes's shop was, I think, that one there.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
This is West End, I think.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
It used to be a hotel as well, I think.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
That's West End.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
That was a temperance hotel, wasn't it?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Yeah, I think it was. I think it might well have been, yeah.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Then you can just see the line in the background there.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
They all mark it as a name.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Amazing, isn't it?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
I'm proud of that.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Do you remember this?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
That's...

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
It's familiar.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Oh, that's in North Street, isn't it?

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Where they did the coal, wasn't it?

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Yes, right.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
That's Mrs Hedge's haberdashery shop.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
I know, I think that's here.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
That was Paris Hage's.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
That's it. You can just see the corner over there.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
So what is that now? The Trouble Box?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Yeah, I think so, yes.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
It looks quite wide for that, doesn't it?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
It always had an espedaster plant in the window.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
It was dead. It was brown.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Really?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
It was always there. I was a kid going past there.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
It was always there.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
It's probably forgotten about, isn't it?

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Yes, I know they don't mean walking very often,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
but I think I'd have gone beyond Mrs Redd's school.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Well, that goes on forever.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Of course, it's part of that trust, isn't it?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Yeah.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Oh, Morgan's. They were the general stores.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
That's right. This was Weather Sparring.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
That was Teggett House, isn't it?

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
I believe so.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
It's got the buggy on it here.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Oh, the buggy.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
That's right.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
There's a fork here.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
It's turning it, yes.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
So what's this? The castle?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
That's the castle, yeah. It used to be the Lion and Castle.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
That's right. It did, didn't it?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
So there was like a black lion,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
a lion and castle, and the lion and the whale was here.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Yes.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
The Lion and the Whale, wasn't it?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
You can see the buggy coming down here in West Street.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
It sort of slabs across the top of it.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
So I don't know when this would be.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
So this would have been, well, obviously prior to 1922,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
wasn't it, when they got rid of that?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000
That's right. I think this is sort of 1860s, 1870s, I would guess.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
You can often tell by the clothes, can't you?

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Yes, yes.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
It's amazing, isn't it?

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Station, I don't know where that is.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
It's not the railway station, is it?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
See, this place, the market hall went through various stages,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
like it's completely sort of stone built there, isn't it?

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And you see it later on where it's like whitewashed.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And the upstairs was developed,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
because there was a window on the end.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
You can find a later picture.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Sheep coming through town.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
I well remember that, though, when they used to drive them actually through the town.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Drive them through, yeah, they did.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Imagine that today with all the traffic.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
That's the milk bar, do you remember that?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
I do, yes, I remember that. That was a favourite haunt, apparently.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Yeah, the Kimley, yeah, it's a good place.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
The mother and some of her friends, I know that,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
they were sleeping at the milk bar.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Is that where Claire Evans is now, or next door?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
It's next door to her. It's a private house now, but...

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
This was a shoe shop more recently.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
I don't know where they're going now.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000
A shoe shop?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Yeah.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
I don't remember it as a shoe shop.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Addison's, Tony Addison ran it, actually.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
It was for a few years, I think.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
That's a little shoe shop on Bridge Street, on the hill.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Lizzie, they called her.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Nice brass scales.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Was that the one on the corner there, as you went down to Water Lane?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Well, John was stumbling on that earlier,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
and that was a wooden shack of a place on the actual corner,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
which is missing altogether now.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
So the first house there now was where this was, I think.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
I certainly remember going into a shop, I think we called it Needers.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
It was on the very corner.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Yes, yes.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Addison's, Tony, the one that we ignored there.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Because there was a sweet shop further down.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
I can remember Duncan Keith lived there.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Mr. Keith ran it, I guess. A sweet shop.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Yes, I remember that one.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
That was on the other side.
