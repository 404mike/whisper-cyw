00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.800
Good afternoon Maria. Hello. Hello, my name is Shea Buckley. I used to teach and was a

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:19.480
teacher at Mary Macklet School. So I'm a volunteer doing some of the interviews and so it's a

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:27.160
pleasure and an honour to interview you as the niece of Paul Sartori.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.760
We have a set of questions that people ask but we don't necessarily stick to them. Wherever

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:39.160
you go, if we find that far more interesting then we'll stick with that and carry on with

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:46.040
whatever you're saying. Okay. Yes. So for the sake of the tape and everything I have

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.800
to ask you the thing. So could you give the tape your full name?

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.800
Maria Bridget Ann Sartori.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.800
Right and we have permission to record this interview?

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.800
Yes.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.800
Right then another question in this. Where and when were you born?

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.800
The 9th of September 1960.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:23.800
Now we can get on to the far more interesting things. Could you talk about first of all

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.800
your early meetings with Paul Sartori?

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.800
One of my early memories of Paul.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.800
Yes.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:47.800
Well my earliest memory, we were living in Trinsara near Llanelli and there were three

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.800
young, there were six of us eventually but in the beginning there were just three children

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:00.800
living in Trinsara and I remember the excitement of seeing young Uncle Paul coming to visit

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:08.800
us and he would do magic tricks. He'd have a coin in his hand and then he would make

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:16.800
it appear from, as if it was coming from out of his ear. We were all on squeals of delight.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:25.800
It would have been about seven, seven years old then. And another thing he'd do was, I

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.800
remember having a fear of spiders.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.800
Right.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.800
What he'd do was, he'd move some furniture and he'd make it his business to find a spider

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.800
somehow and he'd pick it up and he'd take his jacket off and roll his sleeve up and

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:52.800
leave the spider crawl up his hairy arm. We were horrified. Horrified.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.800
Yeah.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.800
He took the fear out of...

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.800
Of spider fear.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.800
He took the fear away from me and my younger brother and sister.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.800
Right.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.800
And he was also very funny. We couldn't wait to see him.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.800
Right.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.800
What am I having earlier memories?

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.800
So he was very good with children then?

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.800
He could stop them at once.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.800
Right.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.800
Just pause, because I've got this written down.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.800
Okay.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.800
If you can find something to put into here, Maria, that's fine. What I'll do is I'll turn

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.800
this up on the recording and then maybe you can have a headphone so it'll be a bit louder

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.800
for you. Try that, see how you get on. Because I can cut all this out, it's not a problem.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.800
See how you feel. Is that a bit louder for you?

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.800
Yeah.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:56.800
Maria, is it okay if you just say hello or something, just to see if Shay can hear you

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.800
a little bit clearer?

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.800
Hello?

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.800
Hello. That's fine. That's very good. Thank you.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.800
So you said you've written a lot of stuff down, so I'll let you get on with that. And

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.800
if you don't mind then, if there's anything I find that's really interesting, I'll maybe

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.800
ask you a few questions as you're going on with whatever you've written.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.800
Okay. Those are the early memories I've got.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.800
Right.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:31.800
And then there's a gasp then. So later memories of that, I would say I would be between the

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.800
ages of 12 to 18, before I passed away.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.800
Right.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.800
He would come and visit us. He'd get a phone call, he'd go down to see his mother, come

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.800
and visit his mother, then his sister, his mother Dominica, and his sister Mary who'd

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.800
been copying for him. And he'd get a phone call, he'd say, Paul's coming over, Uncle

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.800
Paul's coming to visit you. So the house would be the six children.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.800
Right.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.800
The house would be awash with excitement and trepidation for this marvelous uncle coming

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.800
to see us.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.800
Right.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.800
Anyway, he'd turn up, and the first of my men out the door would go with joy to see

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.800
him. And she would bring her sister, and she'd come over from across the road, Margaret.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.800
Right.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:33.800
Anyway, he'd grab onto us. You have to remember now this is in the late seventies and the

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:42.800
lamb chop side boats were in the stables of the seventies. And he grabbed onto us one

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.800
by one and rubbed it into our necks.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.800
Right.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:53.800
And we'd be screaming with delight. And he'd go this to my aunt, and she'd be screaming,

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.800
Oh Paul, oh Paul, stop it, stop it.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.800
Right.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:05.800
But wanting him to carry on even more. And then he'd throw us onto the floor and tickle

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.800
us pretending that he was playing the piano.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.800
Right.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.800
And we'd be laughing so much, it was a tone to pee out.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.800
Right.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.800
The marvelous memories of him.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.800
Yeah.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:32.800
And we think what else now? He'd bring nothing but happiness and laughter to our home. And

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.800
he'd settle down then, and have a whiskey with my dad, and they would spend the rest

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.800
of the afternoon talking.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.800
Right.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.800
And Paul was always full of ideas of how to make money.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.800
Right.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:53.800
And one I remember was, he said to my dad, I was in the room and he said, he said, I've

00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:01.800
got a bloody good idea now though, and how those monks could make money on Gordy Island.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.800
He said they should turn it into an offshore casino.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.800
Right.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.800
With no tax.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.800
Right.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:14.800
Well that was one that my dad agreed it would be good. And then he said I've got another

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.800
idea for us, because they've got lots of farmland, they should start making yoghurt.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.800
Right.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.800
With selling chocolate. They should sell yoghurt, come eat in Gordy.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.800
Yeah.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:31.800
And he, on a personal note, he liked eating snails.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.800
Right.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:39.800
And there's a certain way of talking of course, I've never tried that myself, but he was

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:46.800
particularly fond of them. And when my aunt and aunt Kurt were on their way home from

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:53.800
Italy and France, they stopped the car in France and they went into some of these gardens

00:07:53.800 --> 00:08:00.800
and they were removing some stones and gathering these snails and putting them into capoware

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.800
boxes to bring back for Paul in Harmanford West.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.800
Right.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.800
And he started reading them so he could eat them.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.800
Right.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.800
All right. That's great stories. But yeah, we know.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:24.800
Another thing he said, when, I'm referring to my notes, Paul's nickname was his, when

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:31.800
he, this is from what my dad told me, my dad's passed away now, now he died two years ago.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.800
Right.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:43.800
And he said that Paul's nickname in that family with the youngest of six children was the

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:51.800
Rooter. And the Rooter meaning, my grandmother would say, when he would come home from boarding

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.800
school with the Carmelite monks near Camargan or Llanondailo.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.800
Yeah.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:03.800
What are you doing now Paul? What are you looking for? Looking through all my carpets

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.800
and drawers.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.800
Right.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.800
What are you looking for? I'm looking for something new.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.800
Right.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.800
I'm looking for something new.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.800
Right.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:21.800
Anyway, another thing he'd do, my grandmother said was he would be forever taking things

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:30.800
apart. For example, he took apart a grandfather clock and a man-kill clock. But he would never

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.800
put them back again.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.800
Right.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:39.800
He put there the cafe with the beautiful jukebox, a 1950s jukebox.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.800
Right.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:47.800
And he got it in his head one day, he was going to take it apart. And he took it apart.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.800
And that was the last time it was ever used.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.800
Right.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.800
In Sartorius Cafe.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.800
In Swinsea.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.800
In St. Ashley.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.800
Oh, Clendley. Right.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.800
In St. Ashley.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.800
Right.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:05.800
I'm trying to think of a street, is it Stratley Street?

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:12.800
Anyway, in Sartorius Cafe, another very famous jukebox, which he ruined.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.800
Right.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.800
We'd never heard that story before.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:26.800
He was also, I remember my dad telling me, when he was away in Bowdoin School as a carmelite monk and

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.800
something like that, you know, he was a natural actor.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.800
Right.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.800
We went to see him in my bed.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.800
Right.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.800
And he played three or four parms.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.800
Right.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.800
And he was the only pupil to do this.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.800
And one of the parts, a small part, was he was one of the witches.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.800
Right.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:55.800
And he put, they were laughing at him, he didn't have to put it on a fox's nose.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.800
He had the witch's nose.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.800
And he would be stirring the party, sadly enjoyed it.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.800
Right.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:08.800
Anyway, my other memories of poor land were, do you want me to stop?

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.800
No, you carry on.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.800
I carry on my six of memories of poor land.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.800
This is perfect, Maria, you're doing a fab job.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.800
You're in it, you're in it.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:27.800
Okay, I've got memories when he was in the sanctum, it is a big leap forward now to when he was ill.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.800
Yeah.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:35.800
Because, and he was, they announced that he was ill to the day he died, it was only six weeks I think.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.800
Right.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:46.800
Or was it 12 weeks, correct me if I'm wrong, but it was, I wonder if it was different, I know it was very quick.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.800
Yeah.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.800
He was in the Santa Maria Hospital.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.800
Yes.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.800
The cure is the crumbling of the bones in his spine.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.800
The cure that had been fixed it.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.800
Right.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:08.800
And consulted Dr. Anthony Jones and put him on new traction.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.800
Right.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:19.800
On his head, weight on his head, and they separated the vertebrae and they stopped him from being paralysed.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.800
Right.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:28.800
The person who was in was at part of his time in the Santa Maria in the Applands and so on.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.800
Right.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.800
And once a day I'd go there, it would be nice to see him with my daughter.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:35.800
Yeah.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:42.800
And he would always, my uncle Paul would always bring out trained qualities in different people.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.800
I noticed that and he would put them up there at ease.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:13:02.800
And he put me aside one day and he said to me, he put me aside one day and he said to me, Maria was the last person in the room.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.800
He said, I don't want you ever to forget you're a lovely girl.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:10.800
I haven't had to wear very much of the boy.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.800
That means a lot to me.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.800
Nobody's ever said that.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:20.800
And he said, I tell you something, I've cooked the best egg and chips as well.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.800
And I remember one day my dad saying, Paul's hungry.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.800
Cook him something.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.800
I said, there's nothing in the fridge.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.800
And he said, there's an egg there, yes.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.800
There's a shot of a kid who's making egg and chips.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.800
I said, there's an egg there.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:41.800
And he said, you have a nice egg and chips, Maria.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:56.800
Subsequently, in the last year, when I was abroad on holiday with my old family, my seven-year-old son Paul, we'd go to expensive Italian restaurants.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.800
I'm always an Italian man.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.800
Right.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.800
I became a rabbi of the.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.800
I became a rabbi of the.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:12.800
Paul, my son Paul, the only meal he would eat in these restaurants, have a dad, because he was.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.800
Egg and chips.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.800
Egg and chips.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:22.800
And to this very day, that's his favorite meal, egg and chips.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.800
Did you name your son after your uncle?

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.800
I think, yes, I did.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.800
Oh, that's lovely.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:40.800
And when I ran my grandmother, you're bringing tears to my eyes, I ran my grandmother to ask her what she might be calling my son Paul.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.800
And she said to me, I would be all that.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.800
Oh, Maria, I wish I was with you to give you a hug.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.800
That's lovely.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.800
That's beautiful.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.800
He also said one other thing on his day.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.800
The day before he died, one other thing.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:06.800
It's very important for you youngsters to vote a mass, Sunday mass.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:17.800
Even if Sweeney Todd was saying it, even if Sweeney Todd and Fred were saying it, I would still vote.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:25.800
I don't know if you should have a story about when he replaced his dog, Paula.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:31.800
Inside of a cigarette packet, he was in a funeral.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:39.800
And his mother came along and he spoke to his mother and he said, oh dear God, she's come in and got my dog calling.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:46.800
He opened his packet of cigarettes, somebody gave him a packet of cigarettes, he took all the farts out.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:54.800
And he put the inside of the packet of farts there as the dogs call her and she didn't know the difference.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.800
That's amazing.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:02.800
There's another thing, he was a great athlete, I've got written down here.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:11.800
He was selected, he could have run for, done a long jump for Wales.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:18.800
And eventually, at long distance running, he could have run for the United Kingdom.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:26.800
But all he wanted to do, he told my dad when he was 18, was he wanted to be a priest.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:33.800
And my father said to him, all the girls are after you Paul, all the girls love you.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.800
Can't you wait a few years?

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:41.800
And he said to my dad, no, you've got no idea.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:47.800
The love I've got for our Lord is so overwhelming.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:52.800
I just want to be with him every minute of the day.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:57.800
I love him more than any girl I could ever think of.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:03.800
He said I love him so much and that is what I want to do for the rest of my life.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:08.800
That's my story, complete, completed.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:13.800
That's absolutely amazing, that was fabulous.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.800
My mum stopped to talk like that.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.800
No, that's alright, it would have been wrong.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.800
Is that ok? I'm feeling a bit giddy now, do you mind if I have a sip of tea?

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.800
Of course, have a sip of tea.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.800
I think we'll join you on that. Honestly, that was beautiful.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:36.800
Me and Shea have been very honoured to talk to so many people that knew Father Paul.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:41.800
We've also got to know people that knew your dad and your uncle, Anthony.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:46.800
We spoke to a chap, forgive me, I am shocked with names.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:51.800
He was a friend, I believe, either of your dad or Anthony's.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.800
I want to say your dad, but I'm not sure.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.800
They went to school together.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:05.800
He told us about this story about your uncle taking all of his classmates up to your nana's house

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.800
and feeding them.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.800
I haven't heard that story.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.800
The head teacher didn't want to tell him off,

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:17.800
but he wasn't really supposed to take all of his classmates out of school.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.800
She had to write a note to your nanny and grandad and say,

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:26.800
can you tell him what he did was wrong but his heart was in the right place?

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.800
So just like you saying all of that about him being the router,

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.800
I was like, that fits actually, that really does.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.800
Yeah, yeah.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.800
My cousin, Niko, told me one story.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:44.800
He told me to tell him to tuck his laces out of his shoes to get to a camp.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.800
What, no laces in his boots?

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.800
Oh bless.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.800
Yeah, sorry, I get so excited because I feel like I kind of know him through people,

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.800
that I spend so much time talking about him.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:02.800
But I'm only 26 so I never got the opportunity to meet him,

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.800
but just so many stories.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:11.800
I can't wait for all of you to hear about it because I hope it does you as a family proud.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.800
Thank you.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.800
Listen, I have to go now.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.800
I've got to get my band all done.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:18.800
No problem.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.800
Thank you so much for your time.
