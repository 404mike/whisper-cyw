00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600
Radnysher itself probably never really would have been able to support the recruitment

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.560
of its own regiment.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:18.160
There have been militias in Radnysher in the past and indeed those of you that go and see

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.360
Thomas Jones that's actually the guy inside the bandstand there, go and see his grave

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.320
in Kaibar Chapel.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.720
His inscription on his tablet does detail the association of his family with the Radnysher

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.720
militia.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.600
Now the Yeomanry regiments were largely there as a sort of emergency militia and a lot of

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.240
the time they were used to quell problems with the civilian population, for example

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.760
in the Chartist riots in the 19th century.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:57.640
They were not professional military, it was some guy that was a Yeoman farmer or something

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.000
one day then he was called out, he got on his horse, he had a cutlass and he could go

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.880
around chopping people's heads off as indeed they did at Peter Lee in Manchester when these

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.720
things got out of hand there.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.680
There had been a tradition in Radnysher and in the south of Powys really of going into

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.000
the south of Wales broadways, that's more in Brecknoch.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.600
There was a tradition of going in Radnysher into the 1st Battalion of the Herefordshire

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.760
Regiment as well.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.280
In fact the 1st Battalion of the Herefordshire Regiment was called something like the Radner

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.560
and Herefordshire Regiment or something like that.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.920
Therefore really this explains the reason why we're in the Montgomery Yeomanry here

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.800
and not the Radner Yeomanry.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.160
This regiment had served in the Boer War and throughout the 19th century as its various

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.520
incarnations.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.000
When the British Army went off to the Boer War everybody expected they would do very

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.960
well because of course they were British soldiers.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.760
The upshot of this was that they actually had a complete and total kicking.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.960
Boer commanders absolutely slaughtered them.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.600
Standards of soldiering were very very very poor, standards of musketry were absolutely

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.600
appalling.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.200
Now the upshot of this was really two or three things.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.920
One when they came back Lord Roberts founded the National Rifle Association which popularised

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.760
small boar shooting in this country so that civilians could actually join shooting clubs

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.080
and actually practice their targetry so they could then actually join the army in time

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.080
for war.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.160
That is why around the country we've got hundreds of little small boar rifle clubs

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.280
for example in the bottom of the Houses of Parliament there's a rifle range, in the various

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.800
railway clubs used to have rifle ranges and particularly around Llandridd as well.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.840
Several rifle ranges, a small boar and a full boar.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.960
In 1908 a guy called Lord Haldane reforms the Yeomanry.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.240
He forms what's known as the Territorial Force, now known as the Territorial Army.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.960
In fact the TA had its 100th anniversary last year.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.320
These guys would have met at the drill hall in Llandrinded which is now underneath where

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.320
Tesco's is.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.720
In fact the drill hall was there for about six months ago.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.440
Part of the deal with Tesco's was they built a new one but that drill hall had been there

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.800
since around 1909.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.600
The Montgomery's were not the only people that met there, the Hereford and Stavante

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.160
attacks were there and the King's Shropshire Light Infantry met there as well.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.400
Start of the war the Montgomery Yeomanry consists of four squadrons.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.160
A squadron which is up at Llandruthlin, B squadron which is down at Wellspool, that

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.800
is also the headquarters squadron, C squadron up at Newtown and D squadron down at Llandrinded.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.120
The late Victorians and Wardians, early Georgians were very probable sort of people because

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.920
there was no telly, they went out and did stuff.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.400
So they went out and went to Perthree evenings and Llandrinded.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.800
The lads would do things like join the Territorial Army because of course you had a nice posh

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.080
uniform and indeed the dress uniform of the Yeomanry was actually quite smart.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.000
If those of you who have seen the Trooping of the Colour had actually seen the Horse

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.360
Guards they actually look a little bit like this with these big hats and plumes off the

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.880
top.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.360
You also got when you went on the annual summer camp three weeks under canvas and that really

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.800
for some people was about as close as they were going to get to a summer holiday.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.320
And of course you got your annual bounty as well.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:35.160
So good reasons to join and the Comrade ship and most CA formations have a cheap subsidised

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:42.160
bar so there was probably a bit of that going on as well.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.000
The outbreak of war, that is D Squadron on Comishier Yeomanry, that is Llandrinded's

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.600
cavalry.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.200
That picture is taken as they are formed up on the muster for the start of the First World

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.200
War.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.480
I can see some frantic pointing going on in the audience because there are two highways

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.160
somewhere in that picture.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160
One of them is over here.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.160
And the other one is somewhere there.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.160
Those of you who are local may know Geoff Michael, that's his uncle.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.160
This chap at the back here has obviously just joined, he's in a uniform so they've stuck

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.160
him right at the back.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.160
Because you're not smart enough.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:32.160
They are actually, considering they are a territorial force, spectacularly well dressed

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.160
and they are all wearing more or less the same thing.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.160
It's a standing joke for the rest of us in the old services, the army, they wear what

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.160
they like.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.160
The number of uniforms and possible combinations you have are huge.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.160
They are standing on what is now Tesco's car park.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.160
Which at the time was the Lanark Common.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.160
There's the railway station, there's the police station, down here is the Lanark.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:14.160
Now, as territorial force soldiers, they were, indeed the territorial force was designed

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.160
for home defence, so these guys actually had no obligation to go off and fight the Han

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.160
overseas at all.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.160
They could have quite nicely sat out the war doing garrison duty somewhere.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:32.160
But when asked, okay lads, who wants to come and have a crack at the Han?

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160
They volunteered to a man.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:40.160
Which really is not surprising because of course, you know, if you're going to stand

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.160
in the Lanark having a fight with two mates and they've both volunteered, the peer pressure

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.160
to do so must have been immense.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:54.160
You know, people in non-uniform, wandering the streets, used to get white feathered.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:01.160
So, this is the start of the war and there's quite a bit of harrarring and patriotism.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.160
And they volunteered to a man.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:11.160
Now, bearing in mind that these are in fact a cavalry regiment, you will notice in this

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.160
picture a certain absence of one commodity.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.160
Horses.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.160
In fact, I do think it does say on the...

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.160
Yes.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.160
Something about the, you don't need to own a horse or something.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.160
Yeah, there we are.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.160
But experience not required.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.160
Now, start of the war, the government horse traders went out and started buying just about

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.160
every nag that had a leg on each corner.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:53.160
And many a poor young girl, you know, woke up one morning and found out that Dobbin had

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.160
gone to be a soldier.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.160
Tearfully.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.160
There was frantic horse buying.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:08.160
By the 8th of August, the Montgomery's are assembled and ready to move.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:16.160
Absence of horses, there was also a shortage of binoculars for them to use.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.160
So, they take out a full page advert in the Breckenham-Radner.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.160
Ladies and gentlemen, has anyone got any binoculars we could have, please?

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:29.160
Because yet again, who are the major manufacturers of optical instruments in Europe?

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.160
The Germans.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160
The Germans, Carl Zeiss.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:37.160
So, people give up their binoculars to the Montgomery's for them to use.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.160
They start to move to a war footing.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.160
Now, I haven't got one today, but there are pictures of the squadrons riding through the

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.160
various towns on their way to their muster point.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.160
They all met up, and it must have looked pretty spectacular.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:56.160
The squadrons, the Welsh Bulls squadron had been disbanded and distributed through the

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.160
other squadrons, but they came down from Glenvathlin and Newtown, the North Paris squadrons

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:05.160
come down, Llandrindod, the D squadron went down via Hay, and they all met up for the

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:10.160
first night on Hereford Racecourse, because they needed somewhere that could look after

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:15.160
horses and they had the space to actually, you know, imagine a squadron's about 120

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.160
guys, 120 guys, 120 horses.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:23.160
Now, a full cavalry regiment, you're talking 600 men and horses there.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.160
It must have looked pretty spectacular.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:31.160
They start their way over through the Midlands towards East Anglia.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:39.160
On the way, D squadron have to stop and send home Bugler Hope, because he's 14 years old.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:44.160
We hadn't quite got to the point where we're using 14 year olds to fight.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.160
It did happen.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:51.160
This person killed in the British Army in World War I, Private Condon was 14 years old.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:10:03.160
In fact, some 14 and 15 year olds when they went into recruiting offices were told by

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:13.160
the recruiting sergeant to come back in half an hour when they were 16.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.160
They end up in a place called Ailsham in Norfolk.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.160
By this time they've acquired their horses.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.160
As you can see here, we've actually got a cavalry line.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:31.160
120 horses, in fact, well, 400 or 500 horses would take a lot of looking after.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:42.160
Think of the associated blacksmithery and farrier skills needed to look after 600 horses.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:49.160
Think of the amounts of hay and oats you would need to feed that number of horses.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:56.160
In fact, the first couple of years of the First World War, something like 4 million tonnes of hay

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.160
alone were carried over to the Western Front to feed horses.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:07.160
That's a lot of hay.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:14.160
What used to happen is the local photographer would rock up and take pictures of the lads.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:22.160
They would then take the photos and convert them into postcards which you could then send to your rallies.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.160
Have you seen that one before, Megan?

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:29.160
No.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.160
There are two highways in this picture as well.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.160
D Squadron, Tom Highway section.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:41.160
By this time he's a corporal, or rather a lance sergeant because this is a cavalry regiment.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:48.160
This guy here, I don't know who he is, he may well be Private Hutt, more about him and on.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.160
As you can see they're wearing the cap badge there of the Montgomery,

00:11:52.160 --> 00:12:00.160
the Yeomanry with the motto, which is a Welsh word I can't pronounce, but it means invincible.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.160
They're actually staying in the grounds of Blickling Hall, which is in Norfolk.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:11.160
It's a National Trust property now, birthplace of Anne Boleyn, if you ever go out that way.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.160
You can go there and have a look at that.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.160
The officers of course stayed in the big house.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.160
The seniors were put into local pubs.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:23.160
The junior ranks of course stayed under tents.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:30.160
You can see them here doing what they do, which is training, fooling around, joking.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:37.160
This chap here, I think he's one of the Edwards brothers of Landerindard.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:41.160
This one here is Church Parade 1914.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:47.160
As you can see this time they're fully suited and ready to go, big band of liars of ammunition.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:54.160
All nice and smart, ready to go off and fight.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:13:00.160
Now, we've got these territorial regiments.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:05.160
Large numbers of them, but they are still effectively gentlemen amateurs.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160
One night a week in an annual camp.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:15.160
They are not professional soldiers, so they're not as good effectively as the old contemporaries of the BEF.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:24.160
The guy who stopped the Germans at Mons, the guy who could fire ten shots out of a Lee-Metford rifle at a figure 11 target at 600 yards in a minute.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.160
They weren't as good.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:33.160
We did however have professional forces in places like India, Australia, New Zealand.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:43.160
So the idea of the exercise is then, why don't we bring in all these forces from our dominions and Commonwealth, the Indians, the Anzacs, over to the Western Front.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:48.160
And we'll backfill what they're doing, garrison duties, with our territorial force.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.160
Because that's not quite as hot at the moment.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:58.160
So what they did was they took the Montgomery's and they sent them to Egypt.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:06.160
They spent on the Norfolk coast about 12 months looking east from Kroma.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.160
Waiting for something to happen.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.160
They were doing basically defensive duty on the Norfolk coast.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:25.160
They then get sent to Egypt and they sail out of Plymouth in 1916 in a converted Royal Mail steam packet called the HMT Arcadian.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:37.160
Now as they are sailing down through the Mediterranean, the Arcadian sails through the wreckage of two other transport ships that have been torpedoed.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.160
So the U-boats are out there, sinking everything left, right and Chelsea.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.160
The Arcadian makes it through.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:47.160
Now those of you who know your World War I history would remember these things about these Pals battalions.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.160
They're based like at Akrington and Bradford.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.160
Where they recruited from a single town.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:57.160
And they went over the top of the first day of the Somme, shot to a man.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:02.160
And that actually had huge effects on the little locations and towns they came from.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.160
Because they lost every single man in the town.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:11.160
It's quite possible then that the Arcadian might have been sunk in the Med with 120 of Landrinder's lads in it.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.160
And they've all gone down in a one-er.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.160
In fact the Arcadian was sunk later on in the war off Greece.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:24.160
The loss of life was not great because as she was sunk they were practicing lifeboat drills.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.160
Coincidentally.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.160
Coincidentally.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.160
Yeah, it was very, very lucky.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.160
They come into the Egyptian port of Alexandria.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.160
Where I've been. Absolute hellhole.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.160
And they end up sat in the desert doing garrison duty protecting the Suez Canal.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:55.160
Now, Suez Canal is one of the five great naval choke points of the world.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.160
If you control the Suez Canal, you're in.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:04.160
Otherwise your ships have to go all the way down, around the Cape.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.160
All the way around back the other side.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.160
Which adds 9,000 miles to your journey.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:13.160
So, realising of course the importance of this.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.160
Over here we've got the Silo Peninsula.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.160
Up here we've got Palestine and Syria.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.160
Up here we've got the Ottoman Turks.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.160
They are in the war with the Germans.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.160
Not a hugely professional army.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.160
In fact they've got lots of German military advisors on their staff.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:35.160
Now the Germans have of course realised that our resupply is coming from the Suez Canal.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:42.160
So they say to the Turks, would you mind awfully going down and becoming a complete pain on the Suez Canal.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.160
This is what they do.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:51.160
So the Ottomans start hassling the Suez Canal across Sinai in early 1915.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:57.160
Now, this area here is one enormous desert.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.160
So if you're going to make your way across there,

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.160
maybe you're going to carry all your guns and ammunition,

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.160
but you've got to carry every single bit of water you're going to drink as well.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.160
So, yet again as a military professional,

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.160
we often say that amateurs talk tactics, professionals talk logistics.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.160
Because that is what wars tend to be fought on.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.160
The Germans working with them were organisational geniuses.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.160
And they developed supply lines,

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:29.160
centred largely on railways down through Sinai that enabled them to carry water and supplies.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.160
Particularly lots of camels down there to actually do this.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.160
The Ottoman attacks are largely unsuccessful.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:42.160
They then ignore Suez for about a year because they've got other things going on.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.160
For example, Gallipoli.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.160
Now, a couple of details quite important to this.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.160
On the left hand side there we've got T. Lawrence.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.160
Lawrence of Arabia.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.160
Widely thought to be one of the greatest living Englishmen of the 20th century,

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.160
when in fact he was Welsh.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.160
Born in Traumatic.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.160
The guy on the right is General Allenby.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.160
More about him and I'll play it in the film Lawrence of Arabia by Jack Hawkins,

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.160
those of you who remember the film.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.160
1916, the Turks come down and have another go.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.160
Now, there are only three ways you can get through the Sinai.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.160
Bottom route, middle route, top route.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.160
So they come down the top route and have another go and they get defeated at a place called Romani.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.160
By this day, as the British high command have had enough,

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.160
have been hassled by the Turks.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:43.160
Now, you ask any interest soldier what their role is in life.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.160
It is advance to the enemy, kill them, dominate the ground.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:51.160
So, why not, instead of just sat here and letting these enemy come to us,

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.160
why don't we go out into the Sinai and kick it up a bit.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.160
So what they did was they sent the Australians out

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:01.160
to smash up all the oasis and water storage facilities

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.160
that the Ottomans had got in the Sinai.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:09.160
So, yet again, they reduced this to one enormous parched piece of land.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.160
And from that point on, you're actually quite safe

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.160
because the threat really from the Ottoman Turks has reduced.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:28.160
Now, really, by this time, the offensive age of the horse in war is over.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.160
Cavalry, really, has had it today.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:36.160
So, unfortunately, the Montgomery's this time get their horses taken off them

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:41.160
and told they're going to be remastered as infantry.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:45.160
So they are remastered into the 25th Battalion of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.160
along with an organization called the Welsh Horse,

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:54.160
which was another Yeomanry regiment that somebody founded in the First World War.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.160
So all the Yeomanry regiments, and there were lots of them,

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:01.160
Flintshire, Denbighshire, Gloucester, Leicester, Yeomanry,

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.160
all had their horses taken away.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:08.160
They were formed into one big fighting division, the 74th Division.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.160
Now, how pleased do you think they were to have their horses taken off them?

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.160
Not at all, absolutely not.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:19.160
So they took as their divisional badge a broken spur.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.160
To signify, they had once been horsemen,

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.160
and the horses were still at the back of their mind.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.160
Now, a little bit of all-back training here for you.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:36.160
Allenby's army consisted of two corps, 21 and 20.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.160
20 Corps was under Lieutenant General Chetwood.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:46.160
Now 74th Div, the Yeomanry Div, sat under Chetwood in his all-back.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.160
Now that division, yet again, is broken up into a number of brigades.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.160
74th Division run by Major General Gurdwood.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.160
He's got 231, 230 and 229 Brigade.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:07.160
The 231 Brigade is consisting at that time of four regiments.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:12.160
25 RWF, who are our guys, and three other regiments as well.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.160
Within 25 RWF, we've got four companies, A, B, C and D.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.160
The Montgomery's were smashed up and put into A and B company.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.160
The Welsh horse went and formed C and D company.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.160
So from now on, we're not really talking about the Montgomery's,

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.160
we're talking about 25 RWF.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.160
Still our guys from Landerunded.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.160
There they are.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:39.160
Now, another Welshman is going to get his two pence worth in.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:45.160
1917, the campaign in Sinai has been going pretty well.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:50.160
In fact, it's about the only thing in the entire war that's going well.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:56.160
Now Lloyd George, who's a very astute political man, sees this.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.160
Of course, 1917, you've got the Third Battle of Eek, Pashtun Dale,

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.160
complete and total disaster.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.160
He needs good news.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.160
There are people in the government, people in the country who are saying,

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:10.160
well, it's about time we sued for peace with the Kaiser, we've had enough of this.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.160
He needs good news.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.160
So he says to the high command in the Middle East,

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:19.160
would you mind terribly invading Palestine for me?

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.160
All the time we've got this happening,

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.160
we've got Lawrence of Arabia,

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.160
who is with his Arabs leading the Arab revolt.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:37.160
They are basically running up and down on the eastern flank,

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.160
blowing up railways, destroying water.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.160
And if you remember from the film, they do the attack on Aqaba,

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.160
which is the port on the Red Sea that the Ottomans hold.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:53.160
There's that very famous scene where he claims to have walked all the way through the desert in 39 hours or whatever it was.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.160
Completely rubbish.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.160
But he took his Arabs and they capture Aqaba.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:03.160
So, would you mind awfully going off and invading Palestine?

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:07.160
Now, in charge of the army at this time is a guy called General Murray.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:13.160
Now, of course, every single bomb, bullet, gallon of water you need to take into battle has got to be carried.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:20.160
So what they actually do is they construct a railway back into Sinai and run a water line alongside it.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.160
Huge amounts of labour involved in doing this.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:28.160
What they do is they get the people in the army to come and get the people in the army.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:32.160
What they do is they get the Egyptian Labour Corps, these local Egyptian levies,

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.160
so they're in the heat with a shovel, digging a railway.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:39.160
And the effort involved in this is absolutely phenomenal.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:51.160
They run this railway up the coast and in 1917 there's a battle at a place called Ra'far where they decidedly defeat the Ottomans.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.160
And that's them finished in Sinai.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:57.160
However, we now then need to move into Palestine.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:08.160
We've got the next big sort of place to come to is Gaza.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:14.160
Yet again, still important in Israeli history today.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:21.160
Notice, none of this really, all this fighting is taking with about 20, 30 miles of the coast.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:29.160
They're hugging the coast because out here an enormous expanse of nothingness, heat dust flies.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.160
How much water does a horse drink?

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.160
A horse drinks about as much as 30 blokes do.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:50.160
So a cavalry regiment of 600 horses will drink as much water as 30,000 men.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.160
The first attack is disastrous.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.160
Murray attacks Gaza.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:11.160
Now there is a large chain of defences stretching inland from Gaza.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.160
Murray tries the tactic of banging his head against it.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.160
The first attack is disastrous.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.160
The second battle of Gaza in April 1917 is similarly disastrous.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.160
There were 6,000 casualties.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:37.160
Now our guys from Landarin at this point are not engaged because for the second battle of Gaza, 74 Div are held to the back as a reserve.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.160
So casualties therefore do not happen.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:43.160
This is the Turkish defensive line, one of the Turkish defensive lines on Gaza.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.160
You can see it's interlocking machine guns.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.160
Very, very low rolling ground.

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.160
Very, very large fields of view.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:53.160
If you go anywhere near those you're going to get absolutely and totally taken out.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:03.160
It's so disastrous that Murray is replaced by the General Officer Commanding by Allenby.

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:12.160
So we end up at a place called Beersheba.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:17.160
Now the Montgomery's men of Landarin would have been God fearing men.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:25.160
And as they went through these towns they would have seen names they would have seen in their Bibles on a Sunday morning in Sunday school.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.160
Gaza. It was Samson wasn't it?

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.160
Eilis and Gaza.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.160
Beersheba.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.160
Mentioned from the book of Genesis onwards.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.160
Beersheba is wells. Beersheba is water.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:47.160
Okay, now that's a very busy map. That's because it's a professional military one.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.160
Bear with me.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.160
Here is the defensive line across Gaza and Beersheba.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:27:03.160
Now the Turks decide to stop it here and leave a gap between Beersheba and the Gaza defensive line.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:14.160
They rationalise that in order to take 50,000 men and horses that far inland they're just all going to die first in the desert.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:19.160
So they don't need to actually fortify that because the desert will do the rest.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:27.160
However, what they actually do is they bring a branch of the railway line across here.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:33.160
Very, very, very quietly. If it's possible to build a railway quietly.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:37.160
They also do quite a large amount of deception tactics.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:42.160
They get the Royal Navy some battleships off Gaza to shell Gaza.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:51.160
They've also got a very small force outside Gaza running up and down, waving their arms and pretending to be much bigger than they are.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:28:00.160
Meanwhile, Al-Anbi rocks up to Beersheba with 40,000 men who can be supplied by this railway.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.160
But it's going to be a very close run thing.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.160
Okay, I'll come back to that one in a minute.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:16.160
Now, somebody, when I was doing this talk last week, somebody from Landrunnerd, whose grandfather had been out there,

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:24.160
and she said to me, can you tell me, my grandfather said that everywhere he fought, he was always alongside Australians.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:33.160
And she was absolutely right because the Montgomery's, when they fought in the Holy Land and when they fought in France,

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:38.160
were always alongside Australian formations and fought alongside them.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:43.160
The Australians had an organization called the Australian Light Horse.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.160
Now, these are not cavalry.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.160
In Montgomery cavalry, they have a huge horse with a great big sword.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:55.160
The idea is you wander around, you just wave your saber across the top of somebody's head and take it off quite nicely. Thank you very much.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:02.160
The Australian Light Horse rode into battle. They've got a rifle. They ride in sticks of four.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:08.160
They ride so far up to the battle that they all dismount off their little Brumby pack horses.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:13.160
One of the guys takes the bridles of the four horses, leads them to the rear.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:19.160
The other three then advance into battle. They fight their battle. If anyone were left, they get back on their horses and ride out.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:25.160
This is all very well, except while you're getting off and dismounting, people can actually drop artillery shells on top of you.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:32.160
You're absolutely sitting target. And they were actually the first, the Australian Light Horse in the first two battles were actually used very, very, very poorly.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:43.160
In Beersheba, on the 31st of October 1917, Allenby fights all day. They don't manage to smash Beersheba.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:50.160
Now, it's getting a bit dodgy because you've got 40 to 50,000 people and horses there. The horses haven't had any water for three days.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.160
The men haven't had any water now approaching. We need to resupply for approaching a day.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:30:00.160
Things are starting to get a bit critical. If they don't do something soon, they will lose this battle.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:15.160
At about half past six, on the 31st of October, the Australian commander in charge of the Light Horse decides to send in, as a last throw of the dice, a brigade of the Light Horse.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:20.160
One of his officers said to him, well, I tell you what, why don't we just have a charge at it?

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:25.160
Well, we don't normally do that. Well, let's have a go with a charge.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:32.160
Beersheba has got 17 wells. It's the water. You've got Beersheba, you're safe.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:38.160
What happened, I'll show you a little film now, I looked like this.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.160
Was it a major Australian film?

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.160
Australian film?

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.160
Yep, that's called The Light Horseman.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.160
When would that have been made?

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.160
That was made in 1987.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.160
1987?

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.160
You can get it on Amazon. Just make sure you get the right region DVD.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.160
My new favourite film, The Light Horseman.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:14.160
Well, basically they didn't expect there was a charge, because that's not what Light Horseman did.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:19.160
They did, they weren't cabinmen, they didn't have swords, so they took their bait that sat on charge.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:24.160
In fact, the Turks couldn't just depress the sights on their weapons fast enough to shoot them,

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.160
so they were actually shooting over the top of them constantly.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:33.160
Obviously dramatised, there were no machine guns, because British counter-battery artillery had taken it out by then.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:38.160
Also, the casualties there exaggerated a bit, that was a brigade-sized attack,

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.160
probably the best part of 2,000 men and horses, they suffered 31 dead.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:48.160
That is probably the only successful attack in modern war for using horse formations.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.160
It was astounding, they captured 15 of the 17 wells.

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:56.160
They then got the engineers in to repair the broken ones,

00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.160
and in about a week they'd got a daily capacity for about 350,000 gallons of water.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:09.160
Now, that of course meant that the yeomanry divisions, including our guys at Landrindud,

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:15.160
would then supply, get behind the defensive wall, and then do what we in the military call rolling up a flank.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:22.160
Basically make it where a long and undefended position.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:30.160
Lloyd George said to Allenby, I want you in Jerusalem by Christmas, that is your goal.

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.160
And that indeed is what Allenby managed to accomplish.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:43.160
In fact, he went on after that into Syria and captured Damascus as well.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:52.160
Our guys are not involved in that, because by this stage it is mid-1918.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.160
Things are going badly on the Western Front again.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:02.160
The Kaiser's last throw of the dice, the Kaiser's last, the Kaiser's offensive, also known as Operation Michael,

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:09.160
smashed through Allied formations and actually pushed them back to more or less where they'd started at the start of the war.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.160
So, you know, the last three years they'd been basically doing that on the Western Front.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:23.160
Millions of lives lost, as somebody once said, to move General Hague's drinks cabinet three miles closer to Berlin.

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:30.160
The upshot of this is Allenby losing the battle against the West.

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:37.160
The upshot of this is Allenby loses 60 infantry battalions to go back to France to fight the Kaiser.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:50.160
So, 25 RWF, ex-Montgomerys, sail back through the torpedo-infested Mediterranean on a P&O packet called the SS Malwa.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.160
They come into Marseille, they sit behind the lines for a while,

00:33:55.160 --> 00:34:03.160
they then find themselves fighting the battles of the last hundred days of the war on the Hindenburg Line, a place called Epochie.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:09.160
September 1918, they go into battle at Epochie, they suffer 65 casualties.

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:17.160
During that action, Sergeant Waring, Military Medal, he was from Montgomery, he was from just outside Welshpool, wins the Victoria Cross.

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:22.160
He's killed, it's posthumous, he's killed in the trenches as well.

00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:28.160
Incidentally, attached to 25 RWF at this point is this chap on the right-hand side.

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.160
Anybody recognise him?

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.160
It is the war poet Siegfried Sassoon.

00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:43.160
He started out in the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, he'd been so horrified by what he'd seen at places like Mermetz Wood,

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:48.160
he took his military cross and threw it in the Mersey and refused to go back and fight.

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:52.160
Now he was an influential man, he was of the upper class, he was an author and poet.

00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:57.160
He wrote a very, very long letter to the Times saying, I'm not fighting anymore.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:03.160
They sent him to a psychiatric hospital, Craig Lockhart, in Scotland, and attempted to prove he was mad,

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:08.160
because of course he was actually having prejudicial effect on the conduct of the war.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:15.160
He eventually agreed to go back and fight and was posted in Palestine during the last days of that campaign into 25 RWF,

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.160
and therefore ended up in the trenches with our guys from Landerillen.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:24.160
However, he was there about a week before he was shot in the head, allegedly by a friendly fire incident.

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:29.160
So he wasn't there long before he was cast back out again.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:36.160
He is noted in the regimental history.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:40.160
The Hindenburg line, in front of it, had some high ground.

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:50.160
Now, the idea of the exercise with this assault was to actually take the high ground as a prelude to actually advancing onto the Hindenburg line.

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:54.160
They were actually advancing onto stuff which until recently had been British fortifications,

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.160
because the Germans had just pushed them back.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:03.160
25 RWF, on the flank of the Austrian army, was a very large group of people,

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:11.160
25 RWF, on the flank of the Australian II Corps, ended up assaulting something called the quadrilateral, which was a defensive position.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:23.160
By the 25th of September, 7 officers and 32 men killed, 300 had been wounded, largely by judicious use of gas.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:30.160
By this stage, the battalion actually ceases to exist as a fighting formation and is taken out of the line.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:37.160
Now, we're bordering on the end of the war here. November 11th sounds off and we get peace in the armistice.

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:43.160
The regiment comes back into this country to Welshpool.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:49.160
Now, at this stage we've got a standing army of several million men that we do not need and no money.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:54.160
We do not need all these regiments, so large quantities of them are disbanded.

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:58.160
In fact, all the ex-Yomunary regiments, with the exception of the 12th most senior, are disbanded.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:04.160
So, 25 RWF and hence the Montgomery Yomunary cease to exist.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:17.160
One last parade is held in Welshpool in 1920 and the Giedons, which are the squadron flags, if you like, along with the battalion pennant, are laid up in St. Mary's Church in Welshpool.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.160
Where they still are, if you want to go and have a look at them.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:26.160
As regimental colours are, they are left there, they are not maintained and cleaned.

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:30.160
The idea being that over time they fail away rather like old soldiers do.

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:39.160
This is a picture of Bathsheba Commonwealth graveyard. It's about 70 miles south of Jerusalem.

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.160
Immaculately maintained, as they inevitably are.

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.160
In this graveyard there are two guys from Landerinden.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:38:02.160
Corporal Hutt, who we saw earlier as Private Hutt, killed on the 31st of October the day that charge happened.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:11.160
Edward Daines Hutt, he came from Chatsworth Villas down on Waterloo Road, which is not far from the crossing chip shop there.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:19.160
His mother lost two sons in the war. The other Daines Hutt is also commemorated on the war memorial.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:26.160
There was another chap in there, Private Smith, who was the only Smith, spookily enough, on the war memorial.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:31.160
He was from Lanoilly over the top of the gulf course. He was also killed on the 31st of October as well.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:37.160
So there are two guys from Landerinden, I think they're very good, a very long way from home, I think you'll agree.

00:38:37.160 --> 00:39:01.160
But that, ladies and gentlemen, is it. That shows the path of the Montgomery's from Landerinden through Norfolk out to Egypt, up through the Holy Land, then back through France.

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:13.160
Now, the chap I had, the relative I had, whose daughter-in-law is in the audience today, arrived back in Landerinden, gassed and shell-shocked.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:18.160
Now, had a military pension, but of course that was not enough really to live on.

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:26.160
Now, these days, if you had that kind of injury, the Help for Heroes will look after you a bit, and you could probably scrape along on what you could get.

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:36.160
These were different times. He actually went back to work in a coal mine, which is probably the most rough-tie-tough-tie-nasty occupation you could think of, or really to do in those times.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:49.160
This shows really the type of desperation that people had in the interwar years. It was certainly not a land fit for heroes they came back to.

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:56.160
Thank you very much for listening. It's been an absolute pleasure. Hope you've enjoyed it. And we will see you next year.
