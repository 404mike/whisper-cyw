00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360
Do you think television in those kinds of circumstances can actually convey how people

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.360
are feeling?

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.520
Yes, I think they can.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.640
When it's raw, really, like that was, I don't think that...

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:22.960
You know, you see a lot on television, particularly politicians, unfortunately, anything.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.960
You know.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.960
What's he saying?

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.960
Don't believe that.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.960
You know.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.960
Does he believe that?

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.960
Does he believe that?

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.960
But when, you know, when it's...

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.600
And even reporters, you know, you have a bit of a jaundice for your reporters because they're

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.600
not always...

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.400
They usually have an age.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:47.880
But for something like that, a real tragedy like that, I think they're just trying to

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.560
convey what they see.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.880
And when they talk to people, people are just natural, I think, in those circumstances.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.240
They're not putting on any kind of show.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.040
So in that regard, I think when it's something that bad, yes, I think it can.
