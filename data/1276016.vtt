00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
During the Red Summer in America, the race riots were all over America, not just the South.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.200
Chicago is the one that seems to have gotten the most coverage nowadays, but it happened in other

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:18.080
places. And one of the most telling photographs of those race riots was taken in Omaha. And this

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.480
next video, next narration is from Weymark Productions and it's Race Riots in Omaha,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:34.560
The Lynching of Will Brown and it is chapter 19 of our race riots project.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.240
In the late 1800s, Omaha, Nebraska was a booming western city that was soon to become number one

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:47.040
in the world in livestock meat production. In the early 1900s, nearly 80 percent of Omaha's

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:54.480
population of an estimated 125,000 people had livestock related jobs. These workers were

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.680
primarily of European descent. And from 1910 to 1919, their participation in labor strikes

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.680
and the First World War left many vacancies at the meat packaging plants. To fill the void,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.720
company owners vigorously recruited blacks in the southern states. There were ads and papers in

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.880
Omaha and throughout the South that beckoned blacks to come north to better wages and living

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.600
conditions. The wages that blacks were paid at the Omaha plants were lower than white workers,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.560
but it was significantly more money than they could earn in the South.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.120
Hundreds of blacks began to replace white plant workers and by 1915, a burgeoning black community

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.080
was established near the meat packaging plants in South Omaha and the near north side of the city.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.760
A new African-American newspaper called The Monitor began circulation in the summer of 1915.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.280
The Monitor was published weekly with news stories, columns and advertising that was vital to

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.560
establishing a strong sense of community among blacks in Omaha.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.880
By 1920, over 10,000 African-Americans were living in Omaha.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.920
Because of the rapid growth in the African-American population and employment

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.160
situations at the meat packaging plants, racial tension began to build in Omaha.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.000
This tension culminated in the summer of 1919 when one plant worker in particular

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.680
met a horrible fate. This was the period of red hot summer. This was the period where about that

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.840
what it is you'd already had to ride to St. Louis, other places. And now you happen to be in Omaha.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:41.680
What happened was they they had a woman say that she had been molested or had been sexually abused

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:51.280
by a black man. And that's all that needed to be said. On September 25, 1919, Agnes Loebke

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.280
identified 40-year-old Will Brown as the man who attacked her. Brown was then arrested and taken

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.080
to the Douglas County Courthouse. Before Brown was even identified, a civic storm was already

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.760
brewing in Omaha due to a series of inflammatory stories published in the Omaha Bee and struggles

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.640
for political power between racketeer Thomas Dennison and Omaha's mayor Edward Smith.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:25.520
What's interesting is is that the mayor attempted to keep them from taking Will Brown out of jail

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.480
and he suffered from an inch of his life of his life being taken from him. And that was really

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:41.440
intent from the very beginning to really kill him as well as to bring about the racial tension

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:51.040
even more so. On the evening of September 28, 1919, a crowd of an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 people

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.360
gathered outside the Douglas County Courthouse and demanded that Brown be handed over to them.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.440
Inside the courthouse, a frightened judge and other prisoners sent a note down to the crowd

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.880
saying that they would surrender Brown. The bloodthirsty crowd could not wait

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.280
and rushed into the courthouse to seize Brown. Once in the hands of the crowd, Brown was beaten,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:22.080
hung from a lamppost, and shot more than 100 times. Actor Henry Fonda, at the time just 14 years old,

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.800
witnessed the horrendous event from a second story window at his father's printing company across the

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.800
street from the courthouse. The ghastly melee ended with the burning of Will Brown's body.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.920
An Omaha World Herald photographer captured one of the most infamous photographs in American history.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.560
After the riot, federal troops were called in and for two days Omaha was under martial law.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.880
Even though over 100 people were arrested in connection with the riot

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.640
and the murder of Will Brown, no one was charged. For Omaha's black community,

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.080
an editorial picture published in the Monitor spoke volumes.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:14.160
Will Brown was buried in 1919 in an unmarked grave in Powders Field at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Omaha.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.320
Ninety years later, in July of 2009, a man from Riverside, California, Chris A. Bear,

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.920
who has no ties to the city of Omaha and has never visited before,

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.280
was moved to pay $450 of his own money for a marker for Will Brown's grave.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.240
A Bear said that he watched a special on actor Henry Fonda,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.600
which mentioned the riot and how it affected his life and his acting career.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.720
A Bear also said that he hopes people will stop by the headstone

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.440
and reflect on what happened to Will Brown in 1919.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.560
So that we may never let ourselves sink again to this level of inhumanity.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:07.440
Once again, we would like to credit Weymark Productions for the excellent work of the

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:23.200
Once again we would like to credit Weymark Productions for the excellent work.
