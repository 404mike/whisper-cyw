WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.900
And then so now it's recording so I'm with Gordon and Linda Shears and is this

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:18.080
Marshfield's? Saint Brides. Saint Brides okay and it's Friday July the 5th already 2019

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:26.680
so I'm just gonna pop this here yeah and Gordon can you just tell me

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.400
where you were born? Well I was born in Chapmans Farm in Peterstone in 13th of

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:42.040
February 1934 came here in the June and I've been here ever since. So why did your

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.360
parents move here? Well the Chapmans Farm wasn't big enough it wasn't it

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.720
wouldn't hold enough stock to pay you know make a living and I think the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.120
owner was pretty hot on the rent at the time probably wanted three or four pound an acre

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:08.440
different than today. Was it Tridiga Park farm then? This was the one in Peterstone

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.720
wasn't it? Yeah so this one was the Tridiga? Tridiga Estate. Yeah so what sort of

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.080
landlords were they that you know? Well I didn't have much to do with them

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.120
because soon as my father died I bought it had passed to the Romney Builders or

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.800
yeah the Romney Builders right. Tridiga Estate I don't think they they didn't

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.080
bother you know they they come and done the repairs on the roofs.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:47.320
Look what's wrong with the tree. The moorings climbed up the tree. Oh yes. Well I never I've never seen a mooring climb up the tree. Look at it right up there. The mooring that comes to

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.320
fall is the big mooring climb up there. Sorry about that. No that's alright.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:04.880
So Gordon who were your parents what were their names? Well my father William James Sir O'Shares he was originally a father in all they

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:13.920
farmed in my custom. He when he was 18 in 1916 he was called up for the service

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:23.760
first World War went to France he was a in charge of a mule train taking supplies

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.920
up to the front and bringing never talked about it but probably bringing wounded

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:37.400
or dead soldiers back up to the rising mud and the trenches. They had to have

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.680
duck boarding down for the mules to walk on. If the mule went off the duck boarding

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:51.680
he had a heck of a job to pull him back on to it. And he had two years in the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:00.240
service. Came home when my mother lived in the next farm, Newlands Farm which is

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:11.920
down beyond Shalim camp. I don't know much about it. Tell me about the when he

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.800
warned there was a fire. Oh yeah they had a they tunneled into this side of this

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:27.600
hill and they had places off a main entrance you know for bugs for the troops

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:38.320
to sleep and they had a big, I don't know what it was, a stove in the middle of it and this one

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.960
my father woke up and was full of smoke and it had caught fire. He went to his

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:51.720
superior officer and woke him up, told him. He didn't take much interest in it

00:03:51.720 --> 00:04:00.160
but anyway he got out with five others. That's all of his platoon.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.360
He got them, woke them up didn't he? But the officer went back to sleep.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.160
Went back to sleep and died with the fumes. Quite a few did.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.400
Well he was in a mattress to regiment. Yeah but he woke him up you know and told him

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:22.120
because the fumes killed him and I killed others. But Gordon's father went around

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.440
and got out with him. The officer did make the effort to come out with him but the others you know.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:37.320
That's only one story he said and didn't say much about it. He had gas as well didn't he?

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.000
No he wasn't gassed. He was gassing, he made his chest bad.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.440
No that was it yeah the wetness in the trenches and all it was never dry they weren't and he came out

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.280
and he had asthma then all his life. Really? And of course my mother was in the next farm,

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:01.440
Beatrice Elizabeth Ward. She drove a milk bloat in Cardiff delivering milk because they had

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:14.280
three or four milk carts. Her brothers Clifford and Albert they both had rounds as well and I

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.960
don't know where they got married but my father took a milk round in Patches Street in Grangetown

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.600
of his own and he had a Morris van and a rally motorbike and sidecar and he had a man working

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:34.880
for him. He had one round in town and one round in Pennyland and the Pennyland people paid up to

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:43.280
date because they were the affluent part of Cardiff but the ones in town by 1926 he was old 500 pound.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.340
That was a long penny though see. So he sold the round and come and found the farm was

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.960
available he came out and started farming. Did you say he was delivering milk on the

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:02.080
motorbike and sidecar? With the sidecar yeah somebody I think my father drove the van,

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:11.000
a Morris van he had. But the horses left? He didn't have any horses on the work round.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:21.400
All right. He was motorised. So but did because he was working with the mule trains on the back

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.920
you know was that because he'd worked with horses back home? Yes he worked with horses on his

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:36.640
father's place yeah because his father planned on the Rupert estate. Where was that? At Magreston

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:45.400
and the house was condemned and before he went to the army he hauled all the stone to build a

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:52.920
new house there and then the estate went bankrupt so they said we can't build a new house so this

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:58.200
farm will have to be joined onto the next one so he had to move out so they went to St. Gravel's

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:09.720
for a year or two. But in the forest of Dean? Yeah. Oh really? He didn't like it there and he knew someone I think

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:16.920
it was to do with the Baptist Chapel who owned new house and they took that on but he didn't live

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:24.280
long when he was there. So where is new house? New house is just this side of the

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:36.760
Shire Newton. If you noticed on the corner just before you go to the Shire Newton there's a house with no roof.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:44.360
Yes. Well that's new house. Oh. They said that the walls are bold or something it wasn't worth

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:53.160
repairing that's why they let it go direct. It's a shame. It used to be a lovely house here.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:08:00.360
Used to have goats and everything outside and ducks and chickens and everything it used to look so pretty

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.840
you know and by the road. Well Billy Cutter was. But now it's all untouched. Billy Cutter farmed it for years.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.080
Now Cutter's farmed it and then

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:21.160
a saddler on it. The Coleman had it then. Yes the Coleman had it. So then your father and mother had to find somewhere else to live?

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:28.520
Yeah well they. You had to look around in Patches Street now I don't know whether they lived there as well.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:35.880
I haven't got a clue where they lived. Did they have a dairy herd then? No but they had

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:43.240
milk come down in 17 gallon churns from Carmarthen every morning on the train.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:50.600
You had to go to the station and pick up the churns. In Leaport? No in Cardiff.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:56.360
And then they took them around and they took they used to put them in people's churns.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:02.120
They had it in one bottle. No they had to dip it out the churn. They took it out ladled out and

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.440
yes put it in people's whatever they brought out. Yes.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:17.080
So what's your earliest this is so your parents then came here? Cherry Orchard? Yeah in 1934.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:23.960
Yeah so that was before you were born? No I was four. Three or four men told me. They were the

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:29.000
cat and dog always in Beecherstone that long one that's when he was born in that house. That's the one

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.680
they rented. Oh. So now you know he didn't come many miles away to come down here. I've been here

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:44.520
ever since. Continuous. 85 years. I'm the patriarch of the area since Phil Stocks. Since May or June.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:50.040
Like it yeah. Since Phil Stocks died. Yeah. He's the oldest one. He would have had better.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.360
You know. Better. Well I'm here with you now Gordon so we're gonna have to make.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:01.320
But you know. I'm five years older than John Turner in Church Farm because he's coming up to 80 now.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:08.440
Yeah yeah but Gordon stayed here where others that of their parents were here

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:14.040
and all that time had gone. They moved away got married and moved away and they'd come back

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:22.920
to the area like Sid. Not continuous. No Sheila. She moved into Newport for a while.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.840
Yeah. But she's younger than me. But her mother died. She was living on the corner there.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:32.440
You know. You just had the post office. Yeah. Do you have any brothers and sisters? I had a sister

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:39.800
born in 1926. She was eight years old when you went to John. Yeah. But she died when she was 80.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:48.840
Yeah. In 2007. Yeah. Yeah. So what was it what's your earliest memory then here?

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:55.400
Can I name a few? I could remember.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:05.480
And Gordon could remember when he was a young lad. We've got a gun sight field down the lane.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:12.440
In the wall. In the wall. The servicemen used to go down to train with their guns. There was a

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:19.720
teapot where they used to be sat in that pit with the going across they'd be firing to train.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:25.160
They used to take coachmen to the bottom of the fire. We've got this one shed still there.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:30.040
The other part of the other shed is up here in pieces up here. We got to put together one day.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:37.960
But yes they took over the field and they used to do the shooting and everything. Train them.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.400
Every day they'd bring him down and take him back in the evening.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:49.960
When he was down there with his dad, a little boy, just before the wall,

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:57.640
in the wall, he was down the field with his father and they were doing something,

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:02.680
checking animals I suppose or whatever. He looked up and saw a plane and he was waving

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:08.680
to them because it was so low down. It was a plane with a man taking films and photographs

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:18.920
of the docks. He was waving to him and the man, you could see his face of the man looking down

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.440
like you know because he was taking photographs of the area for them to bomb the docks.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.040
That's amazing. Instead when they did start bombing Rona's area,

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:35.480
Patti Reese used to live in the farm, a long farm down there, that people can stay there now

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:44.280
in caravans and whatever. It's all done up now. She's gone now. But the bomb came down there.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:51.400
The landline came down there. When they had a big fire in the night, all were in the house.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:57.400
When they came out in the morning, there was this big unexploded bomb with the parachute on it.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:03.320
They dropped two mines. The one in the field over the road exploded. It took the roof off the house.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:10.600
Yeah. So her house was this house? No. Someone else's house. Really? Yeah. But they had the

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.880
mine right there. They stayed there all night and with this exploded landmine. This German had been

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:21.400
taking the photographs, look at everything and Gordon had waved up to him like you know. He was

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:30.280
looking down. Someone had gone out with a lamp, a dim lamp and he'd seen it and he dropped the bomb

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:35.720
then thinking it was someone's signal. This was in the night, not in the day. I know in the night

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:43.160
just pitch black you know. So of course he thought someone was giving him a signal to drop the bomb.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:50.440
So he didn't have any sense. So of course you know he just missed the dock then. Why?

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:58.280
That's an incredible story. Yeah. They dropped some down just the other side of the village as well.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:05.480
Yes. And exploded that was. Where was that then? In front of Greyhouse farm. Yeah. And

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:11.240
they closed the road so that our bus service used to have to go along the main road and down the

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:20.200
narrow road here. We used to have a driver who only had one eye and he used a belt down

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.280
that road and he was only wide enough for the bus. He used a belt down that road in the dark.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:30.760
You couldn't imagine that the lights on the bus were very dim because they didn't allow them.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:35.080
And there was big greenies on the one side. It was to scare the life out of us.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.280
How long was the road closed for then? About a fortnight I think.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.760
So were there any craters left from where these bombs were? No, they all filled up.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:51.320
They filled up. Yeah the one where the landmine, that was a crater for years. It had even that

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:57.800
reeds growing in it and things. It was full of water but in the end Peter Rees filled it up.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.840
Was your firebird called up for the second world war? No, no.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:09.400
He wouldn't have gone anyway because his asthma was too bad. Oh gosh, yeah. No he would have been

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:19.080
41 then so he would have been a bit too old. Yeah and he had the farm and everything to me.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.760
So what sort of farm was this then? It was always milking. Sheep.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.360
Pigs they used to have years ago. I didn't see any pigs because they'd gone. Chickens.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:37.640
But they had dairy, milking so it was hard work all in the night.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:48.680
They allowed Italian prisoners to work on the farm and the one, he was a tall thin fellow I can

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:55.480
just about remember him. His name was Gatti G-H-E-I. I don't know what his first name was and he was a

00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:04.280
really hard worker. He was drafted into the Italian army and he won happily by it and I think he was

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:10.360
glad to be captured and he worked hard. There was another one who was the exact opposite him. He

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:20.040
was short and dumpy and he was a lazy so and so. But he had Gatti for quite a long time.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.400
So they would be dropped off in the morning? Yeah they had a like a hammy lorry type.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:31.080
They'd all sit in the side and they'd drop them off pick them up about five o'clock in the night.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:38.440
Where was the POW camp then? There was one in Van Martin. One on the corner they used to have.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:46.120
You came from Newport. Where that big gate is. Opposite Devon schools.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:53.560
Opposite Devon schools there was a camp. But there's one where Trevor used to have as well was there?

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:58.920
Oh that was an army camp. There was a battery. There were no prisoners. One of them went to

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:04.520
prison there? No. I thought there were. Van Martin was a prisoner of war camp and that one there at

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:15.800
Dufferin. The camp in Trinidad House. Well by Trinidad House that was American.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:23.400
When I was in school there was root martyrs. Americans just had root martyrs past us.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.520
We used to go out to see them. Mrs William just said I was to go out to see them by the gate.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.200
Nearly every time we went past somebody would throw out a load of sweets.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:44.440
That must have made such an impression on the young boy these Americans. Yeah they were really

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:45.960
you know long.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:52.920
I don't know when he was in them but there have been a lot. Over 100 probably in each one.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.840
There'd be one go past and then there'd be another one. There might be two or three.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.280
Three groups. Yeah I don't know how far. He'd had to march all the way around.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:09.160
What school did you go to? The one in the corner in St. Brights until I was...

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:15.560
It's a little... there's a... where the churchyard is and the very corner is a little small churchyard.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:20.760
Well that building next to it was the school. It was only a small one just for so many people.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:27.160
It was 35 I think. Oh my goodness. We saw it before it got done up. You know I looked in the room.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.560
They were going to do it and you know maybe took a lot of stuff away.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.160
But you know it wasn't very big room but it was cozy like. Yeah.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:40.920
Oh they had a fire in it. Yeah. One classroom there was only one teacher every day.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:45.640
Yeah. There was too many for her. She couldn't handle it because we were there until we were

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:51.400
11 or 12. Or if you didn't go to Beasley you went there till you were 14.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:58.440
And of course she couldn't teach the young one that knew intake and the older ones. So they split

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:04.280
it and Mrs Morris came then. Well did they just have a curtain across the... No they just split it

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:09.240
one side and the other. You had to put up with Mrs Morris telling the kids because I was a bit

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:15.560
bigger then. Mrs Morris telling the kids starting them on the alphabets you know.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:24.200
Mrs Hughes was there when I went there. I must have started about beginning of 39.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:31.000
And while I was there Lynn Harding was a very famous

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:39.720
Shakespearean actor before the war and during the war. And they had a plaque in the school wall,

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:45.320
on the school wall with his you know a bronze thing with his

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:53.720
autograph you know his outlining on it and embossed it was and writing on it. I don't

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:59.880
know where it is now. It went in the church. Why was that there? And then it's supposed to

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:04.360
have gone in the hall after. Did he come visit it then? He came and visited it. I thought so.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:11.560
To see it. Yeah. Did you? All I can remember of him he was a very impressive looking man and he

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:17.480
had a very very deep voice you know. Come to think of it he was a really

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:24.520
a Shakespearean actor with his voice. Very much like what's his name?

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:33.640
Richard Burton. Richard Burton's voice. Yeah I thought you meant Richard Burton.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:39.480
So was it, did this actor, did he have any links to St. Brian? Yes he was born in the church house,

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:47.000
the pub. Yeah it's a house now. It's still got a kind of a mouth but it's a big house now. They've

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.240
put houses all in the area where the car park used to be. That's up the side church road.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:59.720
That's just on the corner here at the end. But yeah he was you know very

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.160
soft. Yeah he was born there. I don't know what he did in the church. That's amazing. You remember that?

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:12.040
Yeah they used to, another member of the war was they had smoke screens. They had lobbies with

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:19.160
trailers behind them with oil in it and a chimney up the back and they used to generate smoke through

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:26.360
these, this chimney and if whichever way the wind was blowing if the wind was blowing from the west

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:35.560
they'd be over this side and it would be blowing all over the but docks. It's just clouded against

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:42.760
air attacks. If it was an easterly wind they'd go over an ash and they generated there. You remember

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:47.320
that? I can remember them. I remember them just down the road here practicing one day

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:53.560
and my father used to be in dread of them going further up because he was asking me wouldn't

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:59.720
have been able to take the smoke. Yeah luckily they never did. They did down on the corner there,

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:06.760
they did generate it. A practice one in the daytime that was. So you must have seen quite a bit of

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:11.720
activity because you had Newport docks that side, Cardiff docks this side. We used to get under the table

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:20.920
very often when we had the German bombers over. My mum used to live in Newport and she actually saw

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:29.240
they were all firing up at the planes and she actually saw a German plane spiraling down on fire

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:37.640
and they could see the pilot in there before he crashed into a house. It was a tobacco in his family

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:43.560
he had tobacco shop and all his family were killed. The mother, father, daughter were killed in his

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:48.760
house opposite my mum's but they actually saw that he couldn't do anything the German pilot to avoid

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:54.200
because he'd been hit look see and he was on fire and he died himself but you know crashed into

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:59.960
opposite the other side of the road to where my mum lived. That's where the fire station is now.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:06.040
The fire station's there now. Off road. Off road. Yeah. Gosh. Yeah.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.240
Did you ever have sirens going off down here? All the time yeah.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:20.840
Did you have gas masks? Yes I had to take gas masks to school every day on my back.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.920
You get told off if you got to go back home and get it if you didn't take it bring it.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:29.960
So you should make you go back home and get it. So how far was school for you then from here?

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:33.880
Oh just in the village down the corner then. What are you about quarter of an hour? It's about

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:38.600
200 yards isn't it? No it's more than that. 300 yards. So you had to walk there on your own?

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:45.400
Well there's a couple of others used to come to my aunties and my aunties.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:52.680
I've been driving. So very very rural here. I mean the western Welsh buses used to bring

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:59.000
the sailors down for their practice and sometimes a driver would stop and say do you want to lift to

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:06.360
school? He used to get in the bus and go down to the school. They wouldn't be alone. No.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:12.920
Where were the sailors doing their practice? Down in the shed I told you about. Oh really?

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.040
At the bottom of the lane we've got a big shed there. Oh that's where they were doing it? There

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:22.280
used to be all windows in it but children broke in. So what were you doing there? There was an

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:29.480
office there. They had an office there for the ones that were sitting there. As I said they had

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:35.960
the pits with the gun and they pretend planes going across and they'd be shooting at them like

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:44.600
a big target practice. They had a big target on the bank and a big ash heap in front of it

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:51.720
on the field and they had a machine gun in Peter Rees's field halfway down the lane and they used

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:59.160
to fire at this target and the stray bullets that were off just to go in the ash and after the war

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:06.040
a fellow went down there and sieved through the ashes and he had about I think about 10 full big

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:14.120
bags of bullets out of the ashes. We still found them later because the woman down the lane got the

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:20.200
bomb disposal and they came to visit her and because he had to go in Elfield and he was going

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.400
and the children were playing in Elfield. They shouldn't have been in there like because there

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:30.920
was animals on all end. But anyway they found these bullets and everything and these

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.720
these ammunition of course they were wearing them. They thought it was unexploded. So they had the

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:45.720
army the boys came here. I don't remember that. Yeah it was you know they had two children.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:57.160
Ginger yeah remember. I can't think of that. Julie. Oh Julie and her husband yeah. Did you have a

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:01.640
shelter at school? A bomb shelter at school? Yes well it was above the ground. I don't know

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:06.920
where it's still there in the playground. It was part of the Hale Ash you know big inches.

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:15.240
Or was it like a? No it was just a brick building with a concrete roof. Two doors in it that's all.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:22.200
We never used it. It was never a day like air raid down here. No. Not longer in school. Did you have

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:28.440
to have like practice at school about what to do if it did go off or anything like that? I expect so.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:36.600
I can't remember now. So I remember after I was born just after war 94 to 5 I can remember they

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:46.440
used to do the sirens. Yeah they had one by Shepherd's Fish Shop didn't they? Yeah they

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:54.280
used to let it go off a certain day every month or something. To make sure it worked. Make sure it

00:26:54.280 --> 00:27:00.040
worked in case there was any. Really? Yeah I can remember that. Yeah I don't think it's there now.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:05.720
No I haven't done anything for years. During the Cold War it was. Yeah did you have a bomb shelter here

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:11.320
at home? No only the table. They were into the kitchen table. It's hilarious when you think about

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:18.200
that the kitchen table. Were there any gun batteries down here? Yes well on the on the corners

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:26.920
where there's all these bends are there was an army camp there that was an artillery and radar station.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:33.000
Yeah. Yeah they had all sorts of guns there. Yeah that's why I thought there was prisoner

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:37.800
walls well but it was all this army station was it? Yeah. That's where I told all the buildings were in

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:43.160
I thought. Yeah there's still a couple of buildings there. There are still buildings. Really? Yes they're lovely strong

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:49.960
buildings they are as well. But yeah they. Well after the war the people that were short of houses they all

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:56.280
went in there and took possession of it and there was probably about 20 families living in there.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:02.920
So they had a place to go to because of the war. They were there for a good while because Mrs. Pugh was

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:10.920
Arthur McGann. Yeah. Oh McGann. Arthur McGann. Yeah that's his. Is he buried in the church house? Yes.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:18.040
Yeah. So was he an Irishman? No no no he loved him he never knew his parents he was in a

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:23.320
in a home but in a home he was you know. They were both in the services. In the services. And

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:30.280
he was born and they had to go back into the services. He's from Melvin Farrow and you've never heard from him again.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:39.480
No. No. He says. But um. I think he was in London there you want it. I don't know he came down here but

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:46.600
I can remember him. He worked for Derek Baker to Orchard Farm driving the ford and tractor

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:52.760
and used to do some ploughing and all and

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:59.160
because I know he went past our front gate with his discarrows and caught the gate and bent it.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:06.680
It was never the same. Mrs. Pugh was she there as well? Mrs. Pugh had the first one. They were the first in.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:14.680
She was instigator. So who was she then? She lived in Church Road as well. But had they come from outside the area?

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:22.440
No. I don't know where she came from but Bill Pugh was born down here. His father was a

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:28.120
railwayman. And he, I know his father was a railwayman. But he worked on the roads.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.160
For the, maybe in some islands. He used to drive an island motorcyle trimming the roads.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:44.280
In the summer. I don't know what he did altogether. But he had a gammy leg from a motorbike accident.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:51.000
So when he was on his motorbike he had his one leg stuck straight out because he couldn't bend it.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:58.680
What about the Home Guard? Do you remember them? Yeah I can remember them. They got in trouble.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.920
They had a pill box down

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:10.120
Pontestal Ground which is down past the lakes at the moment. And they were supposed to watch

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:18.680
the Bristol Channel you know. And the commander went down there one night and found them all asleep.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:26.280
And that was riot. They put foot before the firing squad for being a super duty.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.840
Yeah. Did you know any of them? Any local men?

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:37.880
A few used to come here to John. John was his age years old mental. She did go dancing and a few of

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:44.920
them would bring her home. Because we got spoons from one of the, from the US. Oh US. I got on them.

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:50.520
And two spoons. I use regular. Every day I use them. And they're still lovely looking spoon.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:57.960
They came out of the pig swill they did. Did they? Someone put them in did they? No they used to,

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:05.160
they used to collect it, boil it up and they called it nutrient. And they used to deliver it

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:09.800
for the pigs. Of course when you were chopping it up you'd find a spoon in amongst it. Yeah

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.480
where they'd emptied it in. I'm looking what they were emptying in from their pigeons.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:25.240
So Joan would have been a young woman at the time. So she used to bring, they used to drop her home

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:31.240
looks here after dance or whatever. Yeah. Walk her home. Walk her home. Yeah. Well she was,

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:36.760
she joined the land army because all the, all the, when they come to 16 or 17 they could join the

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:42.280
land army. Yes. So she joined the land army. And where did she work? She worked here. She could

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:48.760
work at home. On the farm. Really? So did she wear what? Yeah. She wore the land army uniform.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:56.840
Yeah the breeches and all. Yeah. And the green jumper I think it was. Yeah. Was it good, were

00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:01.880
there lots of dances with the Americans? I don't know. I don't know. There was. There used to.

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:10.840
Auntie Phyllis and Uncle Penry, she used to have them bring her, bring her, because she stayed here

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:18.600
for a while. Yeah. Lived here for a while she did. Auntie Phyllis did. Gordon's mum's sister. And

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:27.480
she can, she said she was walking home with one of the servicemen and she didn't realize it. It

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.760
was a pitch black you know because they didn't have any lights along here. Yeah.

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:38.920
Never do. There's still no lights. But he was bringing her home and was they married there?

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:41.240
They weren't married there. They weren't married but they were caught in her,

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:48.280
fiance was walking behind him and she didn't know. Walked all the way up. Listen to him and

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:55.400
Uncle Penry. He said she never knew. Of course I bet she had a shock when she heard. I bet she did.

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:59.400
Oh my goodness. She got married before the war. He was an

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:06.760
Air Force. But he went off with an, she had one child I saw and he went off with another woman.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:13.320
So she was on her own. So she was literally, she got, she was divorced and

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:22.120
Penry was trying to, wanted to court her before she got married. Oh I see. He was

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:25.400
heartbroken when she married him. Oh never, I never knew that. Yeah.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:32.040
But anyway in the end of course he did marry her. Oh. But that was in 1946. He had a little girl and

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:37.000
he treated her as his own you know. Oh that's nice. Now they never had any more children. Oh yeah.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.160
But he was, she was quite tall Auntie Felicity, Uncle Penry because he was shorter. Yeah he was.

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:48.360
Nice looking man, he was always fresh looking. He came here to, he brought the, they had the farm

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:54.520
car because he worked on the mother's farm. Brought the car here to pick my mother and father up to

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:59.320
come get married and we'd bought a tractor a couple of days before and they delivered it.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:04.840
And that's, he was in his wedding suit and he had to get up on the lorry and drive the tractor off

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:13.160
the lot before he went to his wedding. So what was it like growing up here in this you know,

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:19.080
in this village in this area and has it changed much? Well it changed quite a lot.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:24.680
This, the traffic is bad. Traffic is terrible now because it's between the two cities. It's

00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:31.480
early mornings and Auntie time you know all the children, it's the lorries that go past,

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:37.720
it shakes the house. I can't. I yeah, I always remember we were going, I said to Linda you know

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:44.280
we were going to buy a bull up in Abergavenny or see this bull in Abergavenny back in mid-60s

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:51.640
and Albert Priest saw them and his wife, they said they'd drive us up to see this bull

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:57.640
but they couldn't get away in the day so he said he'd be here at about seven.

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:05.720
Well I was waiting outside from seven o'clock until eight o'clock and the only thing that went past

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:09.400
was a red and white bus, a service bus. There was no other vehicles went past.

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:17.720
We got up to Abergavenny about, well Lambeth when it was, must have been about

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:22.760
nine o'clock, half past nine and we, he still went and seen the bull and bought it.

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:29.320
We had to go down through the churchyard to these sheds he had the other side,

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:32.840
walk through the churchyard at nine or ten o'clock at night. Oh with pitch black.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:40.280
It was in November time. What was it, what did you do as a boy? What sort of things did you get up to?

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:48.520
Oh the usual things. You used to help as well didn't you? Oh my father, you couldn't do

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:53.800
nothing you know, you had to go out and do things. So what did you do? What sort of jobs did you have?

00:35:54.760 --> 00:36:07.000
Well NEA making, it was the post user. Yeah. In the making time we'd have to

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:13.160
rake around the corner the edges or turn A that the turner couldn't get to or things like that you

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:20.920
know. In the winter I was cleaning out more than anything because. And the animals you see. Yeah

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:27.720
because if my father's chest was bad he, I'd say I used to say to Linda, he'd sometimes he'd sit in

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:34.440
the chair by the fire and we had the living room was out the back then he'd sit in there perhaps

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:41.400
for two days he couldn't move because he couldn't get breath. So did your mother have to do a lot

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:47.720
more then? I know my dad used to work on the steam engines he was a boiler smith there's no

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:53.880
sheds now, don't make class of sheds with this all houses and flats there now. But I,

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:59.160
because he was working on the steam engines he'd go in the hot firebox

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:05.800
to repair them. Yeah. And of course his lungs, he had collapsed lungs and I never knew him to be

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:11.960
well. I mean he died when I was making to my 19th birthday but he couldn't breathe because his lungs

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:16.680
they said they don't know he kept working as long as he did because in the end you have to, the last

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:22.600
couple years of his life he had to stop working because he just couldn't breathe at all. He didn't

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:28.120
breathe for years like his lungs and you know because of these you know it affected him all

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:35.080
from you know and I used to go down get mum's money on a Thursday to pay insurance bankers

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:42.120
to be done to return but the steam all the steam engines I wish I'd taken photographs but all the

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:47.400
steam engines all shapes and sizes would be in the jet and all the fumes coming from out of them

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:52.840
and it was beautiful sight all the fire boxes and all because they you know and he'd used to you know

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:59.400
then days they didn't have the safety things like that but if you have to try your engine out

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:06.440
when I went down to get he'd say oh then look I went on one side when I'm he took me home

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.880
to the bridge where you have to try the engine out check it was working right

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:15.080
drop me at the bridge so I don't have to walk up and about the house then

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:21.880
but you wouldn't you know I mean you would they wouldn't allow it now you have to try it out you

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:28.440
know I love it yeah be black when he come home with the oil and the grease and you wouldn't do it now

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:33.880
would you you were five or six oh six seven you know used to go down there to get their wages

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:39.640
all alone yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:44.520
and dad used to put his clean hose out and I had a lovely white hand because he's from

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:48.600
Borealmore and he's had put his handkerchief down for me to sit down while he was doing a little

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:54.200
job to have a chat and me throw it back home yeah a lovely memory to have yeah he'd have his tools

00:38:54.200 --> 00:39:00.280
on his handkerchief to keep them clean like when he was doing the job yeah did you have a do

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:04.520
living down here do you have your water courses in your reins

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:13.240
would you know every rain and water course on your land yes also yeah some of them have been

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:23.560
filled in now but uh I I was a state unit the same but what's the name of them love any names

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:27.960
was this is the seal and renew yes about the only one that's named

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:35.080
but that's all on the maps so you wouldn't know the names of the others on your land

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:41.800
there's no other so I we never had any fields names I know there was some of them some of the

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:47.240
fields had names I don't know how they got them I mean the gunsight field we call it the gunsight

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:52.120
because they used to do the training and they had a name to feel but there was

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:58.280
whether one opposite the camp take and Billy Williams used to call it the buttollo

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:05.080
but what it was called the buttollo I don't know that's the one I don't know where it's the one

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:11.960
Derek of just mold or the one next to it at Shervington not now we used to have a field by

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:16.280
the lighthouse itself as well you know the round lighthouse we started field down there

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:23.560
it was a 10 and a half acre field but they put a big bank so it they've spoiled it all now really

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:29.320
because it's a beautiful field did you have a name what was the name of that one we just called it

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:34.520
the lighthouse field the lighthouse field yeah but didn't have a name yeah so did you have grips in

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:41.080
your fields yeah do you still have grips on some of them yeah some have been filled in some list

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:49.240
too and the watering's in the middle the deep ones so does it because um so so from people

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:55.880
outside the area this is quite quite unique this water drainage or the water course system down

00:40:55.880 --> 00:41:01.320
here is it something you just take for granted now or do you understand how it works and which

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:06.840
direction oh yeah well it all it all goes down to the goat the flow is down to the goats and then

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:13.240
the big green coming from marsh field collects there too and then they got a i don't know if

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:19.960
you've been down there have you on the foreshore they've got a big lagoon there that um they made

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:26.040
by the golf club you mean yeah yeah uh they got a big lagoon there that um they made years ago

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:31.960
to collect the water rather than build up and collect the roads because i can remember

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:34.040
going going through

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:49.880
i went to basic school the bus used to we used to have to go to the goat to cut

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:54.440
cut to western welsh it used to come from cardiff would be just on up from marshfield

00:41:55.320 --> 00:42:01.800
and um it was flooded they couldn't get through so they sent a double decker which was higher

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:06.760
and that got through a couple of days and then gradually the water went down until there was

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:16.520
only a small area in the middle and um this day still had the double decker he didn't ease off

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:21.880
to go through the water he went straight through it at full speed yeah we were in the top front

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:26.600
and it went all over the top of the bus oh my god downstairs it blew the inspection

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:33.640
chair in the in the island you know in between the seats they had inspection patches

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:38.360
lower morgon and drunk all the girls because the girls used to stay downstairs they all got wet

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:51.080
was it unusual to have flooding here what was this we never had any flooding here it was only

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:58.040
down the down the broadway well before the the romans was it today before the romans did it it

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:03.640
was all flooded you the dutch the dutch was it the dutch yeah the dutch came and did all the rains

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:10.760
yeah well he's reputed to have done it like more just marshy moors because it there wasn't any

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:16.200
um drainage then it was all water well i think i was over the other side because it's amongst

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:23.080
ditch over the other side yes you've know about it do yeah because the um tint and abbey they had

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:26.920
they used to bring all the cattle down for the summer and graze on the marsh in in the

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:33.320
redwick area and mega but i don't know what happened what was this was used for back

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:41.960
well certainly roman pottery has been found hasn't it um where the neils live where marjorie and

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:48.120
oh don't you remember me that's that way yeah yeah um oh they've spoiled that place to me

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:53.320
haven't they with the industry they got there now it's so different isn't it now what was it

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:58.520
like what did it look like there before it was just like this or me farm fields was it really

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:07.640
that that new road they cut through where the um aldi distribution and there was nothing of that

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:14.440
there it was all just one couple of lanes going down and all fields yeah just all fields everywhere

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:23.880
gosh when i i mean since i've been down here 48 years now really um and um we didn't have any

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:28.760
lights did we love because the roadway wasn't up there it was pitch black down here in the light

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:33.560
there wasn't any of the lights was it along the road or anything whereas that brightens up the

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:41.560
it'd be pitch black you know and the buildings that are down here since uh i've been down here

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:47.800
the building that's gone up because it was very uh old lots of fields i remember being at the

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:54.600
gare in jaynard's enclos looking down here at the odd light from my bed from our bedroom window

00:44:54.600 --> 00:45:00.520
looking down you'd see the odd light yeah where little did i know that i perhaps saw the the light

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:08.600
from the family yeah you know but um that i'd be living down here but um not much at all you know

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:16.360
as far as um no well the fields rumney wasn't wasn't really very big then

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:25.160
and on the sunday all the all the um the boozers used to come out to the pubs in rumney because

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:32.120
they could open the pubs here because it was still casters in england the rumney river bridge was a

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.760
border and they couldn't open in wales which was in cardiff so they all used to walk out to rumney

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:46.920
and get drunk in rumney which pubs were then which clubs oh the there's a rumney castle in rumney

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:53.480
and the crossing at the top cabiners arms used to be there but that's gone now that's a

00:45:53.480 --> 00:46:02.120
no that's a what's name sainsbury's shop that was the three main ones

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:10.200
there wasn't more there was about five or six in some islands but that was a fair walk so this was

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:17.560
considered england at one time yeah so until recent times well it was in it was it was in

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:24.120
in england then and then it became wales and monmouthshire and now of course it's just

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:31.960
the boundary of the river way in chapstow and we valley that's considered with the boundary of

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:38.680
wales now because i was talking to a lady she she was brought up i think it was new house farm

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:46.280
near where the neil's live well that's the and she was saying because you know well that's

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:34.280
such development around here well i can remember going to the some ellen show on

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:53.640
if you go along the main road into room of the card if i need to carry on the right hand side

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:58.840
going in or the left coming out there's one one house that don't blend in with the others and

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:05.000
that was the lodge that was the main entrance to the uh land rumney hall and i think the land rum you

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:15.400
key to the gate across the road so they can work the key to the gate
