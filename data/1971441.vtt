00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The story starts, as I say, a long, long time ago.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Legends, as you can imagine, were passed down from father to son through the family.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And my father told me when I was a small boy about a Japanese warship being built in Pembroke Dock.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
He couldn't remember what it was called.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So when I got older and getting into middle age, I thought, well, OK, what was that ship that dad told me about?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So I started looking, I googled, I found the name of the ship.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I did some research and I found she was built in a little private shipyard called Jacob's Pill.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Now, at the time, I lived in Pembroke Dock and I was able to go and see people in Pembroke Dock and say,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
do you know your ancestors working on the high eight?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Wait, wait, wait, here we are, here we are, look at this.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And they brought out newspaper clippings, they showed me photographs.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And I think because I've got a local accent, I could reach them easily, you know.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So I got a great wealth of information about it.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I contacted the Museum of Wales and Dr. David Jenkins made an appointment to see me.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So I went to see him and told him what I was about.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Had he got any information, he said, well, all I got is this plan.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I said, that's exactly what I'm looking for.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It was the shipwright's plan of the high eight when she was built in 1877.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And across the top, it said Admiral Togo's first warship.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I said, I'll make a deal with you.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I said, you can have photographs of all this or photocopies of all these papers that I've got.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
If I can have a photocopy of that, done.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And that's where it went on.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So I built the ship and it went into a local museum.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
The beauty of that being my wife doesn't have to dust it.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Going back to the high eight, her first lieutenant was a gentleman called Heichiro Togo.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
He rose to become Japan's most famous admiral.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:16.000
He was known as the Nelson of the East because he was the man who destroyed the Chinese fleet in 1895.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
He destroyed the Russian fleet in Port Arthur a little bit later.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And he also destroyed the Russian fleet at the Battle of Tsushima in 1905,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
thus saving Japan from possible invasion from either of those countries.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So he's revered in Japan like Nelson is here.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Now, when he was in Pembroke Dock, he enjoyed his stay so much that when he left, he sent a tree back.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
The tree came with a message.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Please plant this tree in the garden of my lodgings in appreciation of the kindness you've shown me during my stay.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
It was planted. It grows. It's enormous.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
It's 80 feet high.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And of course, all the Japanese Dignit trees that I came into contact with, I took them there.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I introduced them to the new owner of the house.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And I said, well, this is the tree.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Oh, and they'd stand with a hand on the tree and sort of blessing, you know, and the new owner, perhaps I should explain,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
they just take the house over.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And I was terrified.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
What happens if somebody takes a chainsaw to this tree?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So I went to see him and I said, do you realize the significance of that tree there?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
No, please tell me.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
So I explained all this and he said, I know what I'll do.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Now he's restoring the house and he will live in the basement on the ground floor.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
The two upper floors he's going to restore with a Japanese decor.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Now he will attract Japanese tourists to come stay in the house where Admiral Togo lived.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Come and bless the tree that Admiral Togo had planted.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Now, what an advertised employee.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So, I mean, having that, that assures the continued existence of the tree.
