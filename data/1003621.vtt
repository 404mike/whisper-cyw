00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:26.000
On Rachel's Lord, descend and dwell, I make and walk in every rest.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Then shall we know, and taste, and feel, The joys that cannot be expressed.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Now to the God whose power can do, For ever lost and which shall go,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Be ever watching over us, and I, By all the church, through Christ his Son.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:43.000
O Christ, in all the hand of fear, Thee I have won, the hand of fear,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Near and in all the world's rising, On the high His love of faith.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:33.000
O Christ, in all the hand of faith, Thee I have won, the hand of faith,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Near and in all the world's rising, On the high His love of faith.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Be ever watching over us, and I, By all the church, through Christ his Son.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:47.000
O Christ, in all the hand of faith, Thee I have won, the hand of faith.
