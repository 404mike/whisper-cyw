00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
So Minky was, what has, now there's been, we were down on an all-day survey, again Sarah would

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:12.640
remember this, we were down on an all-day survey the other side of Kemi's head a few years ago,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:20.240
we had Lyndon, Janet, Sarah, myself and others on board and we saw something, a flat calm day,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:27.680
and we saw something which immediately Lyndon and said that is just like what you get just after

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:35.040
Minky was just come up and gone down, it's like a bird, you know, a very sort of active, I think

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.920
there were possibly mank shear waters or whatever, all just down in one little spot and a bit of a

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.560
bit of a boil in the water and all that and we stayed there for 20 minutes, didn't see anything

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:52.400
again which is a real shame, possibly should have stayed longer, but the next, a couple of days later

00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:02.960
the people from Swansea University doing the rhizostoma study, they had an aerial, they'd done

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:11.200
an aerial survey to try and track down the bloom of barrel jellyfish and they'd spotted two Minky

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.800
whales, one right where we, within, you know, within 100 yards of where we had seen ours,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.480
seen ours, and what we didn't see it, we saw a footprint or maybe evidence that we've been there

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:31.200
and there was another one that same day up off Aberporth Bay, so you know occasionally they do

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.160
come up this way but very very rarely.
