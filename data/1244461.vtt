When did your family react?

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:10.640
I wrote it in a letter to mum and dad when they were in the Lake District.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.640
And yeah, they were pretty great about it.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.640
Why were your family surprised, Chris? Can you remember?

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.140
Yes.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.640
Yeah?

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.140
They were.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.140
Yeah? Can you remember why?

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.140
Errr...

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:37.280
You had a pet. I remember a tutor that used to be here said it to his dad.
