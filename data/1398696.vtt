00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Live at King FM, we're here with the Seattle Welsh Choir led by Richard Lind at the piano Bill Moore.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And they have a program coming up this Sunday, 2.30 at the Green Lake United Methodist Church,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and then Wednesday a week, a benefit for Children's Hospital.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We're going to hear some selections from that program tonight, live here at King FM.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:34.000
My dear, let me guide you through the world, And you shall know it, and I'll tell you now.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I try knowing the plans, but none have the will, For I am only a guide for thee.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:55.000
My dear, let them tell you, my God, you can hear, My dear, let them out, let them pray to you, My dear.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.000
My dear, let the north yon, the south yon, My seren, the devil, and this proud man,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000
My dear, let me guide you through the world, And you shall know it, and I'll tell you now.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:27.000
My dear, let them tell you, my God, you can hear, My dear, let them out, let them pray to you, My dear.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.000
My dear, let thy Joseph, my dear, let thy Mark, My dear, let the wind, and the rain, and the dark,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:47.000
My dear, let the government, and the press, and the peace, And the power, and the power, and the will, and the will of thee.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:02:00.000
My dear, let them tell you, my God, you can hear, My dear, let their heart, and their will pray to you, My dear.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
A big and loud, a big, a loud, so loud, so loud,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And you shall know the healing, the healing of all my heart.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:08.000
God, the end of all the world, we've gone through, we've gone through, we've gone through, we've gone through,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And now we're going to be.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.000
For a return we are, for a return we are,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Now and for ever, and for ever and ever.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Years and years ago, when I was a boy,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
When we sang and wallowed all night and day,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
In caves that smelt like Sunday afternoons,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
In damp front farmhouse pallets,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And we chased the English, the bears,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And before the motor car, before the wheel,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Before the Duchess faced horse,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
When we rode the daft and happy hills bareback,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
It snowed and snowed.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Snow that swam and drifted out of the arms and hands of bodies of trees,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Snow that grew overnight on the roofs of the houses,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Like a pure and grandfather moss,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Minutely white, ivy the walls,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And settled like a dumb thunderstorm of white-tone Christmas cards.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Oh, one Christmas was so like another,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:53.000
That I can never remember whether it snowed for six days and six nights when I was twelve,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Or whether it snowed for twelve days and twelve nights when I was six.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Mistletoe howled from the gas brackets in all the front parlours.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000
There were sherry and walnuts and bottled beer and crackers by the dessert spoons,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And cats in their furibolds watched the fires,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And high-heaped fire spat, all ready for the chestnuts and the melon pokers.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Uncles sat in the front parlours without their collars,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Trying their new cigars, holding them judiciously at arm's length,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Returning them to their mouths, then holding them out again as though waiting for the explosion.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And a few small aunts, not wanted in the kitchen, or anywhere else for that matter,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Sat on the very edges of their chairs, poised and brittle,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Afraid to break like faded cups and saucers.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
We are not our ever-dislike health,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
When we are sad in our death-loving health,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Or when our present is in the fire,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000
For so time never our well-required.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:08:10.600
Monachor lead honour high, our bow young

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:39.000
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:51.000
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.000
I remember that we went singing carols once,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
when there wasn't the shaving of a moon to light the flying streets.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
At the end of a long road was a drive that led to a large house,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and we stumbled up the darkness of the drive that night,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.000
each one of us afraid, each one holding a stone in his hand, in case,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and all of us too brave to say a word.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000
The wind through the trees made noises as of old and unpleasant,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
and maybe web-footed men, freezing in caves.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
We reached the black bulk of the house.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
What shall we give them? Hark the herald?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
No, Jack said, good King Wenceslas.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
I'll count three.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
One, two, three, and we began to sing.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Our voices high and seemingly distant in the snow-felted darkness,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
round the house that was occupied by nobody we knew.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
We stood close together near the dark door.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Good King Wenceslas looked out on the feast of Stephen,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and then a small dry voice, like the voice of someone who's not spoken for a long time,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
joined our singing.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
A small dry eggshell voice from the other side of the door,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
a small dry voice through the keyhole.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And when we stopped running, we were outside our house.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.000
The front room was lovely. Balloons floated, and everything was good again.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Perhaps it was a ghost, Jim said.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Perhaps it was trolls, Dam said, who was always reading.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Let's go in and see if there's any jelly left, Jack said.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And we did that.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:34.000
B superman

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
We are Seagulls, Seagulls, Seagulls.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
We are Seagulls, Seagulls, Seagulls.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Where the whispers of the sea,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Keep the eagles unwavering.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Where the whispers of the sea,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Keep the eagles unwavering.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Where the whispers of the sea,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Keep the eagles unwavering.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.000
We are Seagulls, Seagulls, Seagulls.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000
We are Seagulls, Seagulls, Seagulls.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Where the whispers of the sea,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Keep the eagles unwavering.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Followed by a song,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Through the early morning.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Free the good men from harm,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000
On it down the floor.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Alleluia, free them,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Alleluia, Lord.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
God of high above,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000
You are our Savior, Lord.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Ever, ever,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000
I'll die a thousand years.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Here and here and there,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000
God, be there, and here.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000
God of high above,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000
You make our mighty trees.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000
We harbor your God, we hope,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Yes, we pray.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000
God, be there, and here.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000
God of high above,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000
You make our mighty trees.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
We harbor your God, we hope,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Yes, we pray.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000
God of high above,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000
You make our mighty trees.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.000
We harbor your God, we hope,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Yes, we pray.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
God of high above,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000
You make our mighty trees.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
We harbor your God, we hope,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Yes, we pray.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
God of high above,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000
You make our mighty trees.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Always on Christmas night there was music.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
An uncle played the fiddle, a cousin sang cherry-ripe,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
an uncle sang Drake's drum. It was very warm in the little house.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Auntie Hannah, who had got on to the parsnip wine,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
sang a song about bleeding hearts and death.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
And then another in which she said her heart was like a bird's nest.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
And then everybody laughed again.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
And then I went to bed.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Looking through my bedroom window, out into the moonlight,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
and the unending smoke-colored snow,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
I could see the lights in the windows of all the other houses on our hill,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
and hear the music rising from them

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
up the long, steadily falling night.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
I turned the gas down. I got into bed.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
I said some words to the close and holy darkness.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
And then I slept.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
The Christmas Song

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Christmas music

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Christmas music

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Christmas music

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Christmas music

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Far where no

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Stunt like a nose

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Far where no

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Stunt like a nose

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
See the traffic

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
See the traffic flow alive

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Far like

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Far like green

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Far like green eye on

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Far like green eye on the fly

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Far like green eye on the fly

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Where let them pacify you?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Where let them pacify you?

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
The Seattle Welsh Choir Live here at King FM.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
The direction of Richard Lind with Bill Moore at the piano.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
A selection from their concert of Welsh Christmas music.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
With some readings from Dylan Thomas, The Child's Christmas in Wales.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
You can enjoy this this Sunday, 2.30 at the Green Lake United Methodist Church.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
That's the small castle-looking church on the south side of Green Lake.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Or on the 13th, Wednesday night, at 7.30 at the Ballard High School Auditorium.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
That program would benefit for Children's Hospital.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
The information line is 425-488-7288.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Richard Lind and Alan Upshaw, welcome to King FM.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Thank you. Thank you.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
It's great to have you here tonight. This sounds like a wonderful concert.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
It's a wonderful program.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
We've had fun working on it.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
It's come together real well.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
We're all just thrilled to be able to do it.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Does it flow through like this for the whole program?

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Yes, we're going to try to do that.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Keep that going, that kind of flow.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
What's the history of the Seattle Welsh Choir?

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
It was formed in 1984.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
It actually grew out of the Seattle Welsh Language Group.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
The language group wanted something to practice the diction of the Welsh music and the Welsh words.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
So they formed a choir and started singing.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
And it's grown. I think the original membership was about 12.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
We're up to 35 now.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Well, that's wonderful.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
How often do you rehearse?

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Every week, Wednesday night, 7.30, Lake City Presbyterian Church.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
And who's the coach for the language?

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
That's a good question because there are several.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
And they're all dialect different.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
I was going to say, do they all agree?

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
No, they don't all agree.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
We have a consensus.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Where does the Welsh language come from?

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Do we know?

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
It's roots?

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
It's the oldest living language in Europe.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
The Welsh language is still alive in Wales.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
About 20% of the population speak it back in Wales.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
And that number is growing.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
And it's, excuse me, I'm not a Welsh language expert, but it's very old.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
It comes out of what's called the Brythonic tree of languages.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Gaelic comes out of the same tree.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
The Irish and the Scottish came, but they emerged at different times.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
But Welsh is the oldest one that's still spoken as a language.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
And it seems that the Welsh people claim most of the consonants.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
There's one or two vowels.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
When the consonants join together into two Ds and two Ls, it becomes difficult.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Well, that's really amazing.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Anything else you want to add about the concert or about the Welsh choir?

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Except that the second concert is a benefit for the Children's Hospital.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
We decided this is the first year we've done two concerts around Christmas.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
We usually just do one moving around different parts of town.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
But this year we thought we'd see if we can benefit a local charity.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
So we have good support from the Children's Hospital,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
who's been advertising and pushing it for us as well.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:32.000
So Ballard High School on Wednesday the 13th at 7.30 would be a good time to come and listen.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
But of course you can always come to both concerts.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
That's what I was going to say. Come on Sunday at 2.30 and listen to that.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Sunday is a benefit for the choir and Wednesday is a benefit for the Children's Hospital.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Well, what's going to happen is people will come on Sunday, they'll like it so much they want to come here.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
They will bring their friends to the second one.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Well, I sure want to thank you all for being here.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
I'll recap once again. This Sunday at 2.30 Green Lake Methodist Church, 2.30 this Sunday.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
And then Wednesday next, that's the 13th at 7.30 at Ballard High School auditorium.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
That's the benefit for children.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:05.000
The phone number and area code 425-488-7288. That's 488-7288.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
I want to thank Richard Lynn, director, Alan Upshaw for enlightening us about many things.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
And Bill Moore at the piano.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
But to all of the Seattle Welsh Choir, thank you for being here tonight.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Thank you very much.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
You're welcome, I will.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Thank you. I think.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
You're listening to Live by George on King FM.
