O, byddwn yn dda.

Roeddwn i'n cael ei ddod â'r radiu, a'r ymddygiad o realiaeth y gallwch chi gyd-dod o'r radiu yw'n ddod yn ddod iawn.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.380
Now newsreels were purely artifacts. They were not intended to show reality. They were intended to show,

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.380
to give an impression which would be sensational, but would at the same time also be propaganda.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.380
And therefore you never really got reality then. But once television came and it was completely sort of,

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.780
you know, fair play, it learned on the job. It got more and more expert at getting there quickly

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.300
and taking the pictures. Oh no, Aberfan was one of those occasions. Because another one, you see,

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:02.820
which came on television second hand, was the Kennedy assassination in 1963, which was run and run

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.540
and run. And I don't think earlier I would ever have really seen the Kennedy assassination in my

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:15.380
mind's eye. But by the time you've seen it five times on television, the image of the head going back,

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.900
the image of the car, so on and on, I have a profound respect and fear of television.
