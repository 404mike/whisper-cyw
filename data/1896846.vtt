00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I got to the gate, first the soldiers wouldn't let me in, I think they were all terrified, full of nerves.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Then I eventually got in, and I hit the gates of a young girl there, a young girl, maybe a young woman.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
She saw the Magin Dovid on my uniform, she saw I was Jewish as well, she wanted to rush forward and hug me.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.000
She looked so repulsive that I moved backwards, and as she moved forward she was liable to fall,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
but I managed to control myself and kept her on her feet.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And then as we worked a few yards later there were about eight or ten people lying on the ground.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And I said, why aren't they in the huts? There were some huts nearby.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
They said, they're dead! And so we'll all be dead if more help is given. It doesn't come quickly.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Right, so then I moved, and then I met three or four women who could talk to me,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and then I started to learn about the gruesome, horrific things the Nazis did.
