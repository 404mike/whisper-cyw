00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Geraint, rydych chi'n cymryd yn March 2001. Rydych chi'n ymwneud yn y ffordd ar ddod o blynyddoedd.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Rydwch chi'n rhaid gweld llawer o gwaith. Pan oeddwch chi'n mynd yn y ffordd?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Roeddwn i'n cymryd yn y gyrfa fforddol, neu fy ffordd ar ddod o bryd, yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn 1960.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Roeddwn i'n cymryd i gyrfa ffordd ar ddod o'r gyrfa Cylgwyn, yna yn y llant Dafri.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Roeddwn i'n cymryd un mlynedd yno, a yna rydw i'n mynd i'r ffordd Caio'r ddod o blynyddoedd y ddod o blynyddoedd, pan oeddwn i'n cymryd i fynd i ddod o bryd yn 1963.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Yn y period pan oeddwn i'n Caio, roeddwn i'n cymryd i fynd i ffordd Tawi, mae hynny'n fy mhroedd mwyaf, yn y ffordd Tawi, yn 1963, i gael y cyfleoedd o plawio, o bwyd ymlaen i'w plantio.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:51.420
Roeddwn i'n cymryd i fy mhroedd i fod yn ffyrdd o'r gyrfa Cylgwyn i'r ddod o bwynydd o bwyd yn

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:01.420
A yna ymlaen o'r plawio o'r ffordd Tawi, roeddwn i'n cymryd i fy mhroedd i fod yn ffyrdd o'r plawio yn y ffordd Tawi.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.760
A'u debyg lifetime wedi bottles yn cael ei f dir snacks i mewn a'i

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.420
beukaid ar y mor o'r bore Pa storyniant a'i barивает.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.420
Cofharaenddi, roedd dyna arian algorithmol drwy gael hynny.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:36.420
ac roedd yn bobl i'n mynd i gyrraedd y plaw sydd wedi cael gwybwyno yn ei.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.420
Mae'r gwybwyno yn cael gwybwyno 6 fwynt.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.420
Ac wrth gwrs, y ffordd y byddai'n mynd i'r ddwy a'r ddwy,

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.420
yw gyrraedd yma yn y ddwy yn y ddwy.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.420
Mae'n un pwynt i'r un.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.420
Felly dyna fy nghymdeithas i Tawai Forest.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.420
Mae'n un pwynt i'r un.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.420
Mae'n un pwynt i'r un.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.420
Mae'n un pwynt i'r un.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.420
Felly yn y ddwy, y plaw ddim yn cael gyrraedd ymddygiadol?

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.420
Nid. Mae'n rhaid i'n cael ei gyrraedd.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.420
Mae'n rhaid i'n cael ei gyrraedd, a'i llwyfio, a'i llwyfio, a'i llwyfio.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.420
Mae'n gwybwyno am y pwynt i'r un,

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.420
a'r 18 oed, a'i ddweud, nid oes yn dda i gyrraedd ffysicol.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.420
Mae'n gwybwyno am y pwynt i'r un,

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.420
a'i ddweud, nid oes yn dda i gyrraedd ffysicol.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.420
Ond roedd yn eithaf cyfle i'r un,

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.420
roedd yn eithaf cyfle i'r un,

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.420
yn ôl i'r un,

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.420
roedd yn sianol yn ymddygiadol.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.420
Felly roedd yn eithaf cyfle i'r un,

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.420
yn ôl i'r un,

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.420
yn ôl i'r un,

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.420
yn ôl i'r un,

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.420
roedd yn eithaf cyfle i'r un,

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.420
yn ôl i'r un,

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.420
ond mae'n gwneud yn fwyaf o'ch un,

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.420
rwy'n credu,

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.420
i weithio yn y cyfle honno,

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.420
yn ôl i'r un,

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.420
yn ôl i'r un,

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.420
yn ôl i'r un,

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.420
yn ôl i'r un,

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.420
yn ôl i'r un,

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.420
yn ôl i'r un,

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.420
yn ôl i'r un,

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.420
yn ôl i'r un,

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.420
Strafflir.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.420
Es 믿d,

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.420
fe was ymumujodd yn Arwen.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:32.300
Pan oedd yn cychwyn Cymru a oedd yn ddioddefnau

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.580
Dylwg Chefnog Lywid Cwahel Tongr ножeng sydd wedi dances.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.420
The sun was shining over the north….

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.420
so….

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.420
pe giwnoedd yn oed a'u fath o.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:05:00.820
Mae drwy ymwneud région mwy o bobl yn microphone nesaf pob.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.820
Mae'n fy nghymdeithas ym Mhryd Tawi.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:15.820
Yna roeddwn i'n mynd yno, i'r Ffyrdd Caio ar y period o amser, ac yna yn ym Mhryd ym 1963, roeddwn i'n mynd i'r Ffyrdd ysgol.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.820
Yn ddwy o bryd yno.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:26.820
Roeddwn i'n mynd ym Mfyrdd ysgol ac roeddwn i'n mynd i'r prostyn môr, yw ym Mhryd Ebbo.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.820
Roeddwn i'n mynd yno ar y ffordd.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:35.820
Roeddwn i'n mynd yno ar y ffordd, roeddwn i'n gwybod pobl yno, roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ffordd, ac yna ar y ffordd y ddwy o bryd,

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.820
roedd y ffordd ysgol yn mynd i'r ffordd a dweud, nid oes yn cael ei ddod yn y bagiau, rydych chi'n ymwneud.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.820
Y ddwy o bryd yno, rydych chi'n mynd i'r ffordd i'r Tawi.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:53.820
Mae hynny'n rhan o'r ystod y gallwn ni'n mynd i'r ystod, a ysgrifennol ym Mhryd Tawi.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:06:04.820
Roeddwn i'n mynd yno yn 1965, yna ymlaen, roeddwn i'n mynd yn octobr 1965.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.820
Ac yn y tîm, y ffordd yna oedd Danny Lewis.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:15.820
A John Jones oedd y ffordd ym Mhryd Tawi.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.820
Evan Jones oedd ffwrdd ym Mhryd Tawi.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.820
A roeddwn i'n cael ymddygiad am y Tawi.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.820
Yn ystod y ffordd yma, roeddwn yn mynd i'r ffordd ysgol,

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.820
yn mynd i'r ffordd ysgol o'r ffordd ym Mhryd Tawi.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.820
Roeddwn i wedi gwneud ychydig o ffartygliau.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.820
Roeddwn i'n mynd yn y ffordd ym Mhryd Tawi a'i dweud,

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.820
dyna'r ystod y gallwch chi'n mynd i'r ddod yn y ddwy o bryd.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:52.820
Mae 22 gweithwyr ffwrdd yma sy'n mynd i'w gael ymlaen i'w gael y cydnabodau y gallwch chi ei gael.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.820
Mae'n dda.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.820
Yn hynod, Mae Rhywun Meirion Dairys yn ymlaen i mi.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.820
Mae Rhywun Meirion yn mynd i mewn ac roeddwn yn mynd i'w gael ei ymlaen.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.820
A roeddwn i wedi cael y ddwy o bryd gyda Mae Rhywun Meirion,

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:14.820
roedd yn carziehen mewn cyllir dros maen cryfnogi'r ffeillio fel raint a ddiрос i ei gyrraedd yn yr un mewn .

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:22.820
Yr un contacted a ysbryd agricultural and prepared and prepared for planting.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:31.820
A allwn iwood yn amlwg am ei bab Bran…

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.820
Roeddwn yn gy DAVID,

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.820
wedi cael ei pw решィoch yn swch i fyny i styried.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:41.820
Roeddwn i'n cael gweithredu'r gweithredu o'r gweithredu o'r gweithredu o'r gweithredu.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:51.820
Roeddwn i ddim wedi cael gweithredu. Roeddwn i'n cael gweithredu yn 10.7 sq. yn Tregarwyr.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:58.820
Roeddwn i'n cael gweithredu yn 10.7 sq. yn Tregarwyr, yn ddaeddau yn fawr iawn, a'n mynd i ddod i'r gweithredu ymlaen.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:05.820
Roeddwn i'n cael gweithredu yn 10.11 yna i gydag fy marn i gydag fy mhan yma ymlaen.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:13.820
Ond roeddwn yn ddaeddon cyfle i ddysgu sut mae'r gweithredu wedi'i gwneud.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:19.820
Byddai'r ffordd o'r hwst yn ei fod yn ei ffordd i'w ddweud yn y pen ddwy a ddweud y papurwch yn ddiwedd?

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:30.820
Rwy'n credu bod y ffordd yw'n ymwneud â'r ffordd i'w dysgu'r ymgyrch yn y pen ddwy,

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:40.820
a fydd angen ymwneud â'r pethau yn y pen ddwy, a fydd angen i chi ddysgu ar eich hunain, a bydd angen i chi ddweud â'ch pwmpenwyr neu'ch bosib yn ymgyrch i'w ddweud.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.820
A oedd y ffordd yw'r pŵer yn ei ddifynu i chi?

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:52.820
Nid, yn eithaf, roedd yn dda iawn. Roedd yn dda iawn, yn y ffordd ymwneud â phobl o'r ffordd y tuwy ffyrdd.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:57.820
Roedd yn cael ymwneud â'r pwmpenwyr. Roedd yn cael ymwneud â'r pwmpenwyr.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.820
Roedd yn cael ymwneud â'r pwmpenwyr.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.820
Roedd yn cael ymwneud â'r pwmpenwyr.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:40.820
Roedd yn cael ymwneud â phobl o'r pwmpenwyr.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.820
Roedd yn cael ymwneud â phobl o'r pwmpenwyr.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:50.820
Roedd yn cael ymwneud â phobl o'r pwmpenwyr.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:55.820
Rwy'n meddu i ddweud aton ar gyfer phobl o'r pwmpenwyr.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:02.820
oedd yn dda iawn i mi oherwydd roeddwn i ddim yn gwybod rhywbeth yn gwneud rhywbeth yn gwneud.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.820
Dyna'r hyn a ddiddordeb y byddaf i'n ei gwybod.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:11.820
Dyna'r hyn a ddiddordeb y byddaf i'n gwybod.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:16.820
A oes gennych chi ddiddordeb gyda phobl lleol fel y ffarmau?

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:23.820
I unrhyw ddegwg, oherwydd un o'r problemau a ddiddordeb yma

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.820
oedd ein bod yn cael ei ddiddordeb.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:32.820
Nid oedd ymddygiadau a'r bwyr neu beth sy'n ddaethu

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:39.820
lleol y byddaf i'n ei gwybod, ymlaen gyda'r ddiddordeb y maes yn ymwneud a'r ddiddordeb yma.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:45.820
Ond oeddwn i'r ffamau Rhys Hughes,

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:52.820
andolwg deill yn deiriau Force.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:12:04.820
Byddwn yn mynd yn llawer a nesai i Se Ad stairs.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.820
Felly, pan oeddwn i'n angen i'w gael ymlaenau'r bwnt, roeddwn i'n mynd i'r Greene i mi.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:13.820
Roeddwn i'n dweud, well, mae'n mynd o'r ystafell yno, a'r ystafell yno, a'r ystafell yno, a'r ystafell yno.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.820
A dyna'r ffordd rydym wedi'i mynd i'w mynd i'w mynd.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:21.820
Roeddwn i'n gwybod y map a'n gallu gysylltu'r ymlaen i'n gwybod, ond yn bwysig, roedd yn gwybod hynny'n fwy fwy o'n dda i'w gyd.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:26.820
Roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ffordd rydym wedi'i mynd i'r ystafell a'r ystafell.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:32.820
Felly roedd hi'n cael pobl gyda'r gwybodaeth a'r ystafell sydd wedi'i cael ei ddod yn ymlaen.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.820
Why would the forest have a shepherd?

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:42.820
Well, there were sheep everywhere, all over the mountain.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.820
Basically all the farmers had sheep.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.820
Thousands and thousands of acres.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.820
Well, there were thousands and thousands of acres.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.820
The number of sheep per acre was very small in terms of being two or three per acre.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.820
But overall there were a lot of sheep.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:06.820
Now, when we were preparing an area for planting, the first thing we needed was to take the sheep off the land, fence the land, take the sheep out.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:11.820
And then when we planted the ground we had to keep the sheep out because the sheep ate the plants.

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.820
There were little trees in the ground.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:25.820
If you didn't take the sheep off, as the ground got hard and the snow came down, of course the sheep had nothing else to browse on except for the trees.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:29.820
And therefore we had to keep the sheep off the planted ground.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.820
And that's what the shepherd did.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.820
And did he experience?

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.820
He didn't actually look after the sheep.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.820
His job was to keep the sheep off the planted land.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:44.820
But were there problems because there was such a lot of acres up there and such a lot of sheep?

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:54.820
Were these sheep owned by one farmer or was your shepherd being able to separate them as that belongs to that farm, etc.?

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.820
We're back again into knowledge and experience again.

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:01.820
Rhys knew everybody's node.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.820
You could look at the sheep and you could tell who owned it.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.820
He made a point of taking it back.

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:12.820
If he took it off our land, he took it back to the owner or at least put it back in the owner's land.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:17.820
But the sheep kept to the...

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:26.820
It was amazing basically that the sheep seemed to know which land they belonged to and they kept to their side of the land.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:37.820
Of course when we planted, we fenced off certain areas, then the sheep had a tendency to try and get back onto that land, which was land that they'd grazed over many years probably.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:41.820
But no, we got on very well with most of the neighbours.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.820
It was actually amazing basically.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:55.820
There was a neighbour called Mr Jones from Dalgwch who I understood at the time he was in his 80s and there was nothing to see him early in the morning even before we got there.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:00.820
He was on horseback going round his sheep early in the morning.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.820
He was absolutely amazing basically.

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:09.820
Although we never really... We planted a lot of Dalgwch.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.820
I was a part of Tawi Centre.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:21.820
Dalgwch was my area, the area that I looked after and the area that I started planting back in the 1960s.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:30.820
Felly byddwn i'n bwysig i ddweud yna bod gan gael y cyfle yma trwy'r llyfr, mae'n cael ymddygiad am y gwasanaeth a'r ffarfyr?

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.820
Well yes, we knew the neighbours.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:39.820
We got to know it was one of the things that everybody knew everybody in that area.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:48.820
You take together the Pantrwy de Deged, you find that especially in the 60s, everybody knew everybody.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:53.820
Everybody knew who lived where and when and who was related to who and what happened.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:16:00.820
So even when I went in as a stranger, if they didn't know you they'd come and ask you who the hell are you?

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:05.820
And you'd get to know them and therefore gradually you'd get to know people.

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:18.820
One of the things that we used to do annually with John Jones was to go to an android for lunch on the day that they were doing cheering.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:27.820
It was an annual thing that John Jones would come and pick me up and we'd go down for lunch and you'd meet all the local farmers.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:33.820
So you'd get to know them not just by name but you could put a face to it and get to know them personally.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:41.820
So that if there was any problem that was arising with fencing or sheep or whatever, then they would talk to you personally.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:47.820
Therefore you'd get to know them and you'd sort out any problems that you had face to face.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:59.820
The problem never really arose. Not only did I get to know all the people there but people like John Jones who'd been there for many years knew them all.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:08.820
Reece Hughes who was the shepherd knew everybody. So if there was a problem with fencing or with sheep or whatever, they would get in touch with them.

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:13.820
They would get in touch with them, he'd come and talk to me and we'd sort out whatever the problem was.

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:20.820
As far as the neighbours were concerned, we were all one big reasonably happy family basically.

00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:36.820
It was quite amusing at times. Basically, Mr Jones came around one day on his horse and we were fencing off a bit of land that we were going to plant next year.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:43.820
Although the commission had bought all his land, he was still grazing it.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:54.820
I was now marking out temporary fencing areas in between what we would fence this year and what we would plant next year.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:18:01.820
Although I wanted to take the fence down a straight line which would have taken some of his grazing away,

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:06.820
he wanted us to follow another route which would have given him a little bit of extra fencing.

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:13.820
We talked about it and we came to a compromise so we put a bit of a bend in it. He was happy and I was happy.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:24.820
It was a very rough, coarse grass area. It wasn't particularly a good area.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:33.820
It was still important to Mr Jones that he was losing this half an acre of land or whatever it was of rough grazing for his sheep.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:40.820
From my point of view, it was costing us a little bit more to get the fencing done than I would have liked if we'd gone in a straight line.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:50.820
But we came to a compromise. We agreed that maybe we should change the line somewhat and keep everybody happy.

00:18:50.820 --> 00:19:07.820
So there was good communication basically between the neighbours and that is perhaps something that maybe we're now losing in that the staff are getting more concentrated in and around the office area where they live.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:22.820
In those days there were a lot of small forests scattered all over and the foresters or the management lived within the community in which case you got to know everybody.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:26.820
But it's almost like every other institution, the personal touch is gone.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:41.820
Yes, there's an evolution in terms of how things are changing. We're having to change basically to meet present day demands basically and the costs have to be kept under control.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:20:00.820
Geraint, did you come across any problems relating to the purchase of land from farmers in the Tawai area? Was there any controversy or how did you find it?

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:11.820
Not personally, no. I met a lot of people and yes, there was of course, as there has always been, if there's any change.

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:35.820
Yes, there are people who have grievance and people who object. But in general, I think that there was a changeover taking place in that the older people, the older farmer in the community up in the tops would farm there for a number of years, for many, many years probably all their lives to some extent.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:56.820
We're now getting to a stage where they would like to have passed it on to their children, but their children started having other thoughts because it wasn't the best of places to be in. For eight months of the year, it was a pretty bleak sort of place to work and a place to shepherd the sheep.

00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:25.820
So I think that the next generation, we're looking at perhaps going further down into the valley and buying. So if they could sell the land, even though they were selling it by thousands of acres maybe at the time to the Forestry Commission who were really prepared to buy it, then they could use that money to buy an alternative farm down in the valleys where they could, instead of having the number of acres to the sheep, they could have the number of sheep to the acres.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:46.820
They could have made a bigger and therefore earn the same return for a much easier and a better life basically than trying to live on land that was so far away from everywhere.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:22:04.820
The forestry also brought some additional compensation basically in terms of we built roads which gave access to any remaining land up on the mountain much easier.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:22.820
It brought trees which gradually grew and gave a lot of shelter which meant that there was better grass growth there, there was shelter for the animals, for the sheep and therefore it could probably improve the quality and the number of sheep that they could keep on the mountain as well.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:40.820
So I'm sure that some of the younger or the new generation of farmers who were thinking ahead, there was benefits to be brought by having forestry up there.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:55.820
The drawback was, and it's still the same, was that here we are planting Sitka spruce everywhere and there were these blankets of woodland of Sitka spruce going to cover the whole of the mountains.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:23:10.820
Yes, this was very true and at that time we did blanket it in terms of planting the main species that we planted in the 60s that I was there, or Sitka spruce.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:20.820
We planted a little bit of lushbore pine in the peat bogs, we planted a little bit of larch on the drier slopes, but in essence it was all Sitka spruce.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:32.820
Well that's changed now, the whole policy has changed now, we're looking at landscaping, we're looking at the diversity of species, we're looking at wildlife, we're looking at conservation, recreation and all the rest of it.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:43.820
At that time, back in the 1960s, it was a commercial proposition that we were aiming for in terms of planting trees to provide timber for the future.

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:52.820
And that timber, the best species for planting to get reasonable growth and reasonable returns was Sitka spruce.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:24:00.820
So would you identify that as the biggest change in your era then, rather than this blanket with these green trees?

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:15.820
Absolutely, absolutely. In the first few years that I was planting up on the top of Tauwyd, it never occurred to me to plant any broadleafs, any hardwoods, it never occurred to me to do any landscaping,

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:29.820
it never occurred to me to think of conservation or recreation or whatever. Okay, there were black grouse and things up there, which you wouldn't find in many other areas.

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:42.820
It was a species of bird that was very, very rare, but we didn't identify that, we didn't do anything to help, to encourage it, to help it to exist.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:56.820
We just planted trees. The object of my exercise was to get every small square metre of land planted up, because I was looking at it from a commercial point of view and saying,

00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:06.820
well, I'm going to put so many trees on this because in 20, 30, 40, 50 years from now I'll be able to reap the returns that this will bring me.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:16.820
But it was only in many terms, and therefore my attitude was totally different from what it is now.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.820
It was the end product you were looking for?

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:32.820
Absolutely, absolutely. We were a factory farming trees, basically, and that's changed now into saying, and that's much more to forestry than just planting trees.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:46.820
Now we look at it in terms of what other benefits can forestry bring to the general public, to the people of Wales, and to the people of Tregarwm and Pondry and Windyguide in particular.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:56.820
So there's been a huge change in emphasis, basically, as to how we approach and work forestry.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:11.820
I spent a few years in Llyfrgell as a planning manager, and my job and my team was to plan for the future, plan on how we were going to fell the trees that had already been planted,

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:24.820
how we were going to restock and replant some of these areas, whether we were going to plant some of it, whether we were going to plant it with a different variety of species rather than just sitka spruce and not popine.

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:40.820
How could we improve the wildlife habitats that we had, and how we could make the areas more accessible to people in terms of recreation, in terms of conservation.

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:45.820
Do you remember the era of the red kite, when it was very much protected?

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:55.820
Well, when I first went there, there was no red kite in the area. When we go back to the 1960s, there was a red kite, which was something I'd never heard of, basically.

00:26:55.820 --> 00:27:11.820
Gradually, the red kite appeared in the Pondry and Windyguide area and Tregarwm area, and it's gradually, over the years, has spread and increased in the numbers.

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:22.820
I can remember, initially they were saying there was only a dozen pairs or something that they could find in the whole of Wales now that were into the hundreds.

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:35.820
In fact, I'm living now in Carmarthen, and it was only yesterday that I actually saw a red kite out the back here. So it's spread and it's...

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:39.820
Do you remember people looking, protecting these nests up there?

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:48.820
No, I don't. No, I mean at the time, back in the 60s when I was there, even in the 80s, there wasn't...

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:57.820
The red kite hadn't spread that far. It was gradually working its way down towards Llandafri.

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:10.820
But basically, it was around the Tregarwm area and the Pondry and Windyguide Distruglir area that there were these few pairs that were breeding.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:20.820
What is the age cycle of a typical spruce that you've planted and growing?

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:30.820
Well, it varies quite considerably. Basically, we were looking at it at the economic cycle in the early years, and that would have been somewhere around 45 or 50 years.

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:38.820
Now, that to some extent has changed because our attitude again has changed, as I was saying, just now about diversity.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:43.820
We're now looking for a diversity of age within the forest as a whole.

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:50.820
In other words, we would like to have trees of one year old up to 50 year olds up to 100 year olds.

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:55.820
So to get that, then we have to vary the age at which we fell trees.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:29:11.820
Just to give you an example, one of the first areas that I planted in 1965 when I first went there as a forester was an area in Difus, which is in Tewi Centre.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:19.820
That area was felled in the middle 90s, which means that it was 30 year old when it was felled.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:27.820
There are other areas there which were planted at around about the same time and are still standing.

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:33.820
So those planted in the early 60s are now getting on for 40 years.

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:42.820
Some of them will be kept even longer than that, so that we have a diversity of age for the trees all through the forest.

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:45.820
So this is something that's changed completely from.

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:52.820
We started thinning in Tewi Forest in 1978.

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:57.820
This was done in Dala of the older trees that were planted in 1954.

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:11.820
Gradually we worked our way through Tewi Forest and the Tewi North, as we used to call the estrid fli of the Pant of Edwin areas.

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:20.820
Then thinning was started there in the early 80s and carried on since.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:31.820
We started filling, that is clear filling some of the trees, which were due to wind blow basically back in the early 80s as well.

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:41.820
Gradually that's expanded in that forest design plans which we now work into.

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:51.820
We took into account all sorts of things in addition to the age of the trees so that we got all this diversity that we were looking for.

00:30:51.820 --> 00:31:02.820
So we've been filling trees all over Tewi Forest basically, but in a planned form rather than in relation to age.

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:06.820
Do you know these diversity of age of trees?

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:15.820
Is that because of what they were to be used for eventually or is that because of what you wanted left in the forest?

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:31.820
Well, in the beginning the sequence was that you planted the trees and 20 to 25 years later they were due for thinning depending on the rate of growth.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:41.820
You went in and you thinned them and then you thinned them every five years or so on the thinning cycle until they came to the age of about 40, 45 or 50 years.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:53.820
At that stage the trees that are left were the big trees and the best trees because you thinned out the smaller trees and the weaker trees and badly formed trees.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:32:00.820
So that you had the best trees scattered over the area and the bigger trees left at the age of 45 or 50.

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:07.820
So you've clear felt then that you started the cycle again. You've replanted it and then the cycle restarted.

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:23.820
It was to a great extent to meet the economic requirements really because the bigger trees were of greater value to us because they went into milling timber or construction timber and what have we.

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:31.820
Whilst the smaller trees were principally into pulpboard or fence material.

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:49.820
It changed somewhat over the years in that if we went for this diversity then trees that we felled at 30 year old weren't as big as those that were felled when they were 50 year old.

00:32:49.820 --> 00:33:01.820
There were trees that had not been thinned because of the ground conditions and the windiness of the area that we were in.

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:06.820
Then we wouldn't thin them because of the danger of getting wind blow.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:15.820
So in order to minimise the possibility of getting wind blow we wouldn't thin them.

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:24.820
The ones that were not thinned tended to get felled earlier because of the danger of having wind blow.

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:32.820
Whilst the ones that were grew on the better ground grew faster, gave us bigger trees and we kept them longer.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:44.820
The object will be to keep trees as long as we possibly can in certain areas, in the sheltered areas, in the areas with better ground.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:51.820
So that we get this diversity of big trees, small trees and more hubby which will encourage the wildlife basically.

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:57.820
It will also add to the amenity and the landscape value of the land.

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:12.820
A hefyd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd, mae pobl sy'n mynd ymlaen i gyd yn ymwneud â llwybr, llwybr bach, llwybr ymwneud â llwybr ymwneud â llwybr, a phwyaf o'r cyfleoedd.

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:21.820
Felly, er bodwn yn ymwneud â'r historydd o'r ffordd gyda'r prosiect hwn, rwy'n gwybod oherwydd y queillwch chi,

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:26.820
Felly, mae'n dweud y byddwn yn edrych ar gyfer y gwaith yn newid yn y glas, yn fwy o bwynt yn y dyfodol?

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:37.820
O'n iawn, o'n iawn, rwy'n credu bod os ydyn ni yn ôl yn, neu os ydyn ni yn ôl yn, ymlaen, 20 mlynedd o amser, y bydd y gwaith yn newid yn fwy o bwynt yn y dyfodol.

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:49.820
Mae'r llwybr brod, sydd wedi bod yn cael ei chymryd, yn cymryd i ddod o'r ffordd, yn y gofn, yn y gofn ymlaen,

00:34:49.820 --> 00:35:01.820
bydd yna fwyaf o dynion, mae'r llwybr yn ei wneud yn y ddod yn fwy o ffordd yn y ddod o'r hynny.

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:04.820
Byddwn yn gweithio'r blancet o'r sprws y byddwn yn cael.

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:08.820
Why do you think that this wasn't done then in the 50s and 60s?

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:19.820
Well the whole attitude was changed, basically it was all, first admissions objectives was to have a reserve of timber.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:28.820
Therefore you planted the timber, the tree that would grow best on that soil at that altitude.

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:33.820
And that turned out to be Sytka Sprws.

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:38.820
And therefore, anywhere where we thought Sytka Sprws would grow best, we would plant Sytka Sprws.

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:49.820
The alternatives in terms of larch and multiple pine would only come about if the soil and ground conditions warranted it.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:52.820
So we would plant Sytka Sprws blankets on it.

00:35:53.820 --> 00:36:03.820
But the object of the exercise was to have a reserve of timber, to make up for all the timber that was felled in the first and second world war time.

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:08.820
So the government objectives changed basically.

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:20.820
And now with the Assembly, basically other factors have taken over from the economic aspect, although the economic aspect is still important.

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:29.820
Other aspects have taken on a much greater emphasis really than they were back in the 1950s and 1960s.

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:39.820
I understand Geraint, you were involved in a bit of a drama up on the mountains there.

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:52.820
Well, yeah, there was a murder actually that occurred in the early 80s up on the mountains within Togby Forest area.

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:59.820
And I was asked to go down and meet the police at the incident room.

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:06.820
And they were looking for this person who they thought had been involved.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:11.820
And they knew that he was somewhere up on the mountains.

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.820
They thought he was somewhere up on the mountains.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:22.820
Of course within the area, Togby Forest area, there were a number of cabins that we used in for wet weather.

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:28.820
There was a number of derelict houses which the Commission had bought over the years.

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:34.820
And although the police knew the location of some of these, they didn't know out all of them.

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:44.820
And therefore I had to spend a day with a number of policemen, a number of police dogs, a number of guns.

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:53.820
We went round all of these derelict houses, these cabins and sheds that we had about this.

00:37:53.820 --> 00:38:09.820
So that I could identify where they were and for them to go in and see if this person was there or had been there over the few days that they'd been looking for.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:15.820
We didn't actually find anybody. It turned out in the end that he had actually gone from the area.

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:20.820
But that was quite an interesting day basically.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.820
Were you frightened?

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.820
I kept that out of the way basically.

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:38.820
They were very methodical and knew exactly what they were doing in that you would initially send the dogs in and the dogs would identify as to whether the place was empty or not.

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:44.820
And when they found that it was empty then they went in and cleared the place out.

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:57.820
Then I went in and had a look round just to see if anything had moved or changed or something that was there or that shouldn't have been there or something that wasn't there that should have been there or whatever.

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.820
But we didn't really find anything or anybody.

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:01.820
Did they catch up with this chap?

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:08.820
They did eventually, yes. He was arrested and convicted but nothing to do with me I'm afraid.

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:10.820
Do you know where they found him?

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:18.820
He'd gone from the area across into Llanwrtyd and spent a night in Llanwrtyd as I understand it.

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:24.820
Then he went down to Hampshire and I think they eventually arrested him at Hampshire.

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:30.820
He was charged and taken to court and convicted for the murder.

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:37.820
You've got a couple of interesting tales Geraint.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:43.820
Well yes, interesting. I found them quite interesting and even frightening at the time.

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:48.820
The first one relates to a farmer who rang up one day and said,

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:52.820
I've got a field next to one of your plantations, I want to control burn it.

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:59.820
I want to burn the dead grass.

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:07.820
He'd grown quite roughly over it and wanted to burn it off so the fresh grass would come up earlier.

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:17.820
So he said, yes, okay, we'll come along and we'll help you control burn a strip along the forestry to protect the forest

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:23.820
and we'll meet you there at sort of 11 o'clock in the morning. I think it was a nice Sunday.

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:31.820
So we turned up and the whole lorry load of us got out and we met the farmer and everything was okay.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:40.820
Then all of a sudden the farmer got on his horse and he had behind him on a piece of rope a piece of sacking

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:46.820
which he must have dumped in some excellent paraffin or something.

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:50.820
He'd only lit this sacking and off he went through his horse.

00:40:50.820 --> 00:41:00.820
Now this wasn't what we called control burning because across the mountain he went with this burnt sacking sack on fire behind him

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:04.820
and we were supposed to keep control over this fire.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:10.820
Our intention was to burn a little bit at a time, sort of 10 metres and put it out, another 10 metres and put it out.

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:14.820
Oh no, he was hundreds and hundreds of yards away and there was a whole ring of fire.

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:19.820
So we all panicked and chased after it and put the fire out as best as we could.

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:24.820
It frightened the life out of me and I think that it frightened the life out of everybody else

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:28.820
because this wasn't control burning, there was no control at all.

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:40.820
The other incident that happened, I wasn't personally involved with it, but John Jones who was the forester in Tully North,

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:49.820
went for a walk round the woods one evening and came across this little campfire

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:58.820
and in this campfire were three or four people dressed in a type of army uniform or something.

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:07.820
It turned out they were the Free Wales Army and the Free Wales Army were on manoeuvres by the Rwyd, all four or five of them.

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:14.820
They were camping out on forestry land near the stream near Pantybedwen.

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:26.820
John, the member of the local army cadets force, sat down and duly talked to them.

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:33.820
Mark was here with them, he didn't talk about tactics and manoeuvres with them,

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:43.820
but it seemed as if they were spending the weekend up in the mountains having manoeuvres on behalf of the Free Wales Army.

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:49.820
I don't know whether they had real guns or didn't have real guns.

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:59.820
All I can say is that a number of weeks later John was visited by a senior detective from Aberystwyth wanting to know what was going on

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:11.820
because I think a farmer had complained that he'd found a sheep that had been shot up in the mountain and the police were making inquiries.

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:28.820
I don't think I would have had the guts that John Jones had to go and talk to these people who were pretty amateurish in terms of their army experience.

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:35.820
But John being the character that he was, I almost felt at home with him.

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:54.820
How many people were employed? When I went there in 1965 I think there were somewhere in the region of 40 to 45 people being employed there.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:44:00.820
Those were the people who were permanently employed there. There were people who came in the tenants, as we used to call them,

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:05.820
who came in to do ploughing, added two, three or four, added extra people to it.

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:19.820
Also the roads people, the civil engineering branch came in, I would bring another 20 or so people in at certain periods of time when they were building roads around the Tully Forest area.

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:31.820
I think that at one time we used to make the pay for about 60 to 65 people at the maximum.

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:42.820
This was back again in and around the 1960s. Since then recruitment has been slowed down and it's came to nothing really.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:49.820
People have left and people have retired and people have left for all sorts of reasons.

00:44:50.820 --> 00:45:04.820
Until I think now that we probably employ no more than one directly employed person within the Tully Forest area then.

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:10.820
Because Tully has now been allocated into a delivery forest district.

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:17.820
So it covers a very large area and the delivery forest district covers a large area and Tully is only basically a part of it.

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:28.820
But that's the huge change that has taken place from the early 50s and 60s when they used to apply a large number of people into the small area that Tully Forest was at the time.

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:38.820
Simply because there was planting in Prep Ground going on there, we were planting in the region of 1,000 acres per year at the height.

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:48.820
I think that it grew to something like 11,000 to 12,000 hectares eventually.

00:45:48.820 --> 00:46:04.820
So it was quite a large forest area concentrated basically between Plandyr Mwyn in the south and Pontrwyf in the north, Tugadol in the west and the Elan Valley watershed in the east.

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:08.820
It was all concentrated in that sort of area.

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:14.820
But that's one of the big changes that has taken place in the 50s and 60s.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:24.820
It employed a large number of people coming from Pontrwyf in Deguyd, Tregaron, Llanderwy Brefi and Rhondda Mwyn.

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:40.820
I suppose one of my claims to fame as far as North Tully is concerned is that I was responsible for the first clear felling of trees.

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:52.820
This was on the part of the plant of Edwinessdau in that trees had been planted there probably privately before the commission started back in, I can't remember exactly,

00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:55.820
but somewhere around the early 1920s.

00:46:55.820 --> 00:47:07.820
There was a block of larch in one of the fields from the Pant of Edwain croft area of Pant of Edwain.

00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:12.820
They were quite large trees, they had been well thinned.

00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:32.820
In the late 1960s we sold the timber off to Lampeter Sawmills and we felled the timber and took them out to roadside and stacked them at the side of the road best that we could.

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:35.820
Lorry's came in and collected them and took them away.

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:45.820
My claim to fame would be that I was responsible for the first clear felling in Tully Forest.

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:49.820
So that would have been the first commercial venture in a way then?

00:47:49.820 --> 00:48:04.820
It was the first real income that we had acquired from the forest district, from the felling of trees in the late 60s.
