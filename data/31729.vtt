00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This name proves he loves the sunlight

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Green as when leaves in her hair

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Both gloves keep her going, Tuesday

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Her head is full of flowers

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
They sweep across her face, glimmering in the sun

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We love you mum, we love you mum

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Like a silky hair floats through the air

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We love you mum, we love you mum

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Like a river on a peaceful summer's day

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Ivy hair there when it slides down her cheeks

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
As it growing towards the ground

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Her eyes are as light as leaves

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Her mouth is like a row of daisies

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Her lips are red

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And so are her cheeks

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Violets waving in her hair

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Like fox gloves running down from the wall

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
We love you mum, we love you mum

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
A beautiful smile, blowing a kiss

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
We love you mum, we love you mum

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Both the cheeks glimmer in the darkness

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Her eyes are like rose petals

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Her smile, a row of lavender

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Her dappled crown sparkles in the sunshine

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Her mouth, a caterpillar of different petals

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Her dappled crown sparkles in the sunshine

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Her mouth, a row of lavender

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Her dappled crown sparkles in the sunshine

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Her mouth, a row of lavender

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Her mouth, a row of lavender

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
We love you mum, we love you mum

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
A beautiful smile, blowing a kiss

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
We love you mum, we love you mum

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Both the cheeks glimmer in the darkness

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Her mouth, a row of lavender

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Her mouth, a row of lavender

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Her mouth, a row of lavender

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Your smile reminds me of your red shining tulips

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
We love you mum, we love you mum

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Your hair is like a large balloon with holes and dew drops

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
We love you mum, we love you mum

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Her crown bears her name
