00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Ion, Llyn Palmer

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Mae'n ion, Llyn Palmer.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Yn y ffordd, rwyf yn artist solo, rwyf yn gwneud ystafellol, ystafellol.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Rwyf wedi bod yn bandau, roeddwn yn band ym mhob ym mhob y Debyl, roeddwn yn band ym mhob ym hedonch,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
rwyf yn llawer o bandau gwahanol a ddim wedi gwneud, ddim wedi gwneud yn faterioolol, i ymchwil.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Ym mhob ym mhob y Debyl?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Dwi ddim yn gallu ei ddod, dwi ddim yn gallu ei ddod.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Iawn, llawer o ddau, unrhyw beth oedd.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Dwi ddim yn credu bod hi'n bod yn tjysgrifion, oherwydd, yna, roeddwn yn mynd ym mhob ym mhob 16, 17,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
oherwydd, roeddwn yn mynd ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob 4 o ddau o weithiau,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:57.000
oherwydd roeddwn yn mynd ym mhob ym mhob 16, 17, oherwydd roeddwn yn mynd ym mhob 15 o ddau o weithiau.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Mae'n bwysig ym mhob ym mhob 16 o ddau o weithiau,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
oherwydd roeddwn yn mynd ym mhob 16 o ddau o weithiau,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
oherwydd Steve Albini was playing guitar and he was producing her album,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and I bumped straight into her with some special fat all over her.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
She was quite apologetic, and I was apologetic.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Like I said, I hadn't seen her, and then all of a sudden I come round the corner

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
after one of the pillars in TJs, bumped straight into her.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I wouldn't say she got soaked, but it was embarrassing.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I think she apologised to me, even though I think I went straight into her.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
So it was a strange thing.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It was quite memorable, because I used to run into them once, bumping into anyone anyway is strange,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
but then when it's PJ Harvey is...

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I'd only recently gone to Glastonbury, and she was on stage,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
on one of the big stages, in her pink cat suit and everything, months before, so then to see her in TJs.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I'm not sure dates, to be honest.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Exact dates? I don't know. No.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Especially the Glastonbury, but it could have been afterwards, couldn't it?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Yeah, maybe it was afterwards.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
TJs? Oh, it's absolutely brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
One of the best nightclubs you could ask for, to be honest.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
When you think of all the up-and-coming bands that used to play there,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
they would play TJs, and then six months later they'd be playing Glastonbury, you know, big stages.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So many bands came through that place. Amazing.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It wasn't so much the gig was memorable, it was the memorable bit of bumping into PJ Harvey, I suppose.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Not every day that happens.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Were you a fan of Shadr? Not really.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I used to like Big Black. Probably got a couple of albums a day.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It's probably from my brother, really. He probably bought them and then gave them to me, or whatever I do.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
It didn't really matter when you went to TJs. I think they used to put on so many good bands

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
that you might not have even heard of them, and you would go there and you'd have a good night,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and then you'd become a fan.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I can't remember the date, I can't know. I can't remember the year, I can't remember.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I can't remember yesterday. I should have done my research.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I don't know, I suppose it was the grunge scene, really. That was the era.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
It was like a cave inside, made of, I don't know, what, like plaster and whatever,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and bits of cobweb hanging down, if I remember.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
They did change it a couple of times, didn't they? They had a huge makeover where they knocked through or something.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I don't know what they did, actually, but there was like a proper bar area then, the one side of it.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Then still the cave bit in the other side.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I can remember once, I'm not sure what stage it was, but the toilets had overflowed.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
There was planks walking into the toilet to go to the urinals,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and you had to walk across these planks because the floor was flooded,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
yet they were still open and they were still using it.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
You probably couldn't do it these days, health and safety.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
There was always a gang of us that would go to these gigs.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
That was the good thing with Newport. You could just come into town,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and you could go to a particular pub where you'd meet.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
We'd normally meet at the Riverside or Morringer, and then just pop along with the TJs afterwards.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Very rarely you would arrange something. They would just be there.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I've been playing in bands in TJs myself, so you might go there the next day.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
When you're actually in the nightclub, when it's happening,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
there's not really much of a smell, it's just a nightclub,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
but then you go the next day and it's horrendous.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Yeah, you're mixed with bleach and beer and sick and everything.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So many bands were coming here from America, and there were a lot of bands forming as well.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I'm not sure if the scene is the same now. I don't really know.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So many venues have closed.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
It must be difficult for bands to get together and gig now.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
There are still venues, but not like TJs, I don't think.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
I suppose times change.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
I think we did make a bit of an impact, I suppose.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I think newspapers were calling us the new Seattle on there, I think, at some point.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So there must have been something really buzzing at that period of time, I suppose.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So it was nice to have lived through that.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I don't know if people will talk about that sort of time from years to come, like now.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I mean, this band's popping up, but to me they all seem to be sort of recycled things.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
That sounds like so-and-so. That sounds like so-and-so.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
It was a gig that I actually played with Headhunker.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000
We'd done a few gigs in and around Newport, and we got a chance to support Selecta, the ska band.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Our singer, Marcus, at the time was the bouncer in TJs.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
So we asked Johnny Cicola, any chance we can support tonight?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And he was like, a last-minute thing.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Yeah, OK. So it was a big gig for us.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
There were a few hundred people there. They had a big following.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So we were a bit nervous, but we played really well.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Absolutely smashed it. They seemed to like it.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
It was a different crowd. We weren't ska, but if you like music, you like music.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And they seemed to like us.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.000
We'd borrowed their drums, and our drummer on the last song put the pedal right through the drum, split the drum.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.000
It was about half past eleven at night with about 200, 300 people there and no bass drum.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
So Johnny Cicola was going crazy. He was going mental.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And luckily, Carlton comes in the story again, saved the day, because he lived around the corner,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and he just happened to have a set of drums set up in his living room.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
So we borrowed the drums quickly and saved the day he did.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
It was great. But I don't think they ever returned the drums.
