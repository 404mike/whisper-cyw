00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
I didn't go to Cathedral Road very often, maybe a few times, but more likely to be on

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.040
Yom Kippur because we do shul hopping.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.920
In order to stay fasting and whatever, we'd walk from one synagogue to another, so we'd

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.200
go to Cathedral Road and we'd go to the Reform, just to make use of the whole day so that

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.560
we had something to do.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.080
Because you're not allowed to eat?

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.760
No, not allowed to eat or drink.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.280
So that way, we managed it somehow.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.000
So there'll be something going on at the synagogue?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.640
Maybe even if there wasn't something going on, but it was just something to do, it's

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.640
what we did.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.840
So there'll be groups of you going around?

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.160
Yeah, there'll be a few of us going around, all doing the same thing.
