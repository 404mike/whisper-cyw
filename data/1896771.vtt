00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920
To me, I equated to conform with having an easy life.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.480
And also you learn how to dodge things if you can.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.120
However, I did think I am doing it for a purpose.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.480
I think this is something which may be endemic in people like myself.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.280
You know you were fighting for a cause.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:32.880
And therefore everything you did was for the benefit, you were idealistic in a way.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.440
I had this idealistic thought in my mind that everything I performed and everything I did

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.080
was for the benefit of society and intimately, of course inclusive yourself.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.800
If you want to defeat Hitler, you had to do that.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.560
And that is something which prompted me, which motivated me.
