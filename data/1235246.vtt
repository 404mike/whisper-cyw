00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800
Oh, we had to get permission for one of us to go over to the other person's unit in order

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.800
to have dinner together.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:21.040
I think that was purely for the menu sake as well. The only time Steve could stay past

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:31.480
12, it happens to 11 in my room, was either Christmas, or birthdays, or funerals.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.020
Did they explain why?

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.940
Fire regulations.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.300
Alright, Steve how did you feel about that?

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.540
Er, I wasn't very happy at first.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.640
At first we were told nine o'clock.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.520
Yeah, yeah that's true, yeah it was. Nine o'clock was the curfew, which was a little bit steep really

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.080
when you consider you didn't finish your meals till around about six, even half past, on some

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.800
occasions, which didn't give you a lot of time in the evening. Especially when you were looking for

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.400
somebody because they're really busy in here, so then Steve was looking for somebody to try and get

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.200
him over to Martin, so sometimes we'd only have an hour together.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.880
How did you feel about that Sean?

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.400
Angry.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.080
Did they ever, so they said it was fire regulations?

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:30.160
What happened originally was one of the people at work in one of the units went to one of the managers

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:41.280
and said, they're both adults, they have a right to have a bit more time. So it was thankful

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:49.920
to a good person who showed up for us and then it got extended to half past eleven.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.880
Do you think it's because they're not experienced in supporting relationships?

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:03.040
It may well be because there aren't any, there isn't anybody else at this time like us

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:12.240
and when we first got together, I don't know if you remember but I do, being told they were trying to

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.960
discourage married people, whether that is something to do with insurance, I don't know.
