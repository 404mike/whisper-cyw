00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:26.960
Good morning.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.840
The heart of the Christian Gospel is that God forgives our sin.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.660
It is the most radical, world-shattering idea, so that lots of people find it impossible

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.560
to believe.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.240
Man believes that the best way of dealing with wrongdoing is to punish the wrongdoer

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.080
by making him suffer.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:58.200
For so many people whose minds have been soaked in the thought that punishment is demanded

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:06.720
by the moral order, find it difficult to entertain any alternative, and may even consider any

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.320
alternative to be utter nonsense.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:19.560
Nevertheless, the good news is that sin, with all its evil consequences, can be abolished

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.200
and is abolished by forgiveness.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.520
Jesus used the metaphor of debt.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:38.520
Just as debt is cancelled by a word so that it no longer exists, so sin ceases to exist

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.520
by forgiveness.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:49.800
Now, dare we be so bold as to apply this thought to the present almost universal demand that

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.280
Saddam Hussein and his lieutenants should be punished?

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.520
Well, let's think about it.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:06.840
The wrongdoer who is punished is made sorry for himself, not for his evil.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.600
Therefore he may be made to feel proud of himself as a martyr or hero, and therefore

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.440
proud of his sin.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:24.920
Moreover, is there a punishment severe enough to fit this particular crime?

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.320
And I don't think so.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:36.280
And if this is the case, then the way of punishment does not deal adequately with the enormity

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.480
of the evil.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.680
I believe that Kuwait should receive reparations from Iraq, but again, no measure of reparations

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.280
can equate with the damage that has been done to property and persons.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:01.680
The whole situation is so riddled with evil that only the most radical and positive cure

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.080
can create the foundations of a new society.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:15.480
Punishment is destructive, not creative, and in any case, let him who is without sin cast

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.680
the first stone.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.080
Christ died for us while we were yet sinners.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:31.640
It's the goodness of God that leads us to repentance, not repentance that leads to forgiveness.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:41.360
Forgiveness involves the basis for a new relationship, for reconciliation and healing.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.680
And it's only through the creation of new relationships that the problems and tensions

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.720
of the Middle East can be resolved.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.840
We'll think about it a little more tomorrow.
