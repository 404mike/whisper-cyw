Would you say that your life has turned out the way you expected it to so far?

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:19.200
I find it really difficult with life here because everything and everyone has got their

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:28.640
ways of living. It's not, as I said earlier, it's not like you can just pick up the phone

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:40.240
and say do you want to come over. I'm finding life really difficult because I don't, again,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:53.280
I don't have friends. I don't have my true friends. I'm happy in the way that I'm living

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.440
independently and I'm working but that's it. Apart from that there's nothing,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.840
nothing else that makes me feel really comfortable.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.760
And yeah, I just wish I could pick the phone up and say do you want to come over

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.360
and we can just do things.
