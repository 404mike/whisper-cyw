00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800
Of course, it's a part of the family that I remember as a child.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.600
It went over on a train, going over the road, you know.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.600
It was the very last...

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.800
Yeah, it was... again, it must have been pretty close then, as I say, end of 1953.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.400
It must have been, it was one of the last.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.600
And I remember it moving, the effect going on.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.400
You know, we'd gone over the rider, and it was like...

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.200
It was rocky, I suppose it was, but it appeared as a child, you know,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.400
that the thing was really scary.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.600
We'd put it out with the water, and it closed then.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.800
They used to say that it cost more money to maintain it,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.000
and then we picked it to one end, and it has to start all over again.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.200
And I sincerely hope you have great luck,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.800
and that somebody, some kind of entrepreneur will have enough sense

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.400
to realise that, you know, that that building should be preserved.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.600
It would be lovely if some small enterprises,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.800
I thought some of the ideas that were put forward when I came over to the fair

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.000
the other day, they had, I thought were brilliant, absolutely brilliant.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.400
I thought they were sensible, logical,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.600
and there was obviously a lot of thought had gone into them,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.800
and trying to bring back old skills as well, and that was one of the ideas.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.000
They still had the tip on top of the pants, you know,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.600
and that's been all been regenerating, covered over.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.800
I look out now onto a pleasant valley.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.400
I originally came from Orkdale in the Sowie River.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.200
It was known as the Black River when I was a child.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.800
Norfishing it, it was absolutely filthy with the wash we had in Orkdale.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.200
I mean, some of the salt used to go down, the cold salt used to go down into the river,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.800
hence the name Black River.
