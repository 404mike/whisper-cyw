00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.280
Well the Stranglers were brilliant, you know, like probably on Newport twice actually.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.000
The first time was at the Alexandria Club, which is over by the centre after Newport.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And it was a great old nightclub called the Alexandria Club.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.680
It's no longer there, unfortunately.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.680
It was one of the last remaining nightclubs in Newport.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.680
And they had the right atmosphere because they had ladies in the night frequenting the place.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.680
And bouncers on the door, they'd chuck you out if you looked at them wrong.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.680
But it was quite a quiet affair but they went on really well.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:56.680
The crowd liked them so I booked them for a second gig, which was at the Roundabout Club,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.680
also known as the Magic Roundabout.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.680
But Glenn wasn't too happy with it because it was too posh for him.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.680
Because it was also called the Pullmans, which was named after a posh train coach.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.680
And Glenn thought posh was one of them so he wasn't too happy with that.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.680
But the crowd was happy with him, I was happy with him and memorable gig.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.680
They were both pretty similar and probably the same audience turned out twice.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:36.680
But the first venue was more suited in the surroundings and the fact that the band was happier there than they were at the Roundabout.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.680
The Jam was the best band I'd put on. The atmosphere was absolutely wonderful.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.680
They were electric, they were, you know, for a three piece.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.680
They had high energy, full on.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.680
The crowd was loving it. Probably the best atmosphere out of all the bands that I had in those at the Roundabout.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.680
Unfortunately though there was a little incident towards the end.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:06.680
Some of their equipment got pinched and the police was called in and I'm not quite sure what was missing, an amplifier or something.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.680
And I'm not sure if it was retrieved or not even.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:17.680
But someone went in to see the band and I had to leave the room a bit quick because there was a few ladies in the room.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.680
With the boys and they had to call back ten minutes later.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.680
They didn't seem too bothered, it was more down to the father who managed the band.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.680
The father of, was it Weller's father? One of the boys' father managed the band.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.680
And he was more concerned about sorting out the problem.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.680
And I left it to him and the police really because I didn't know anything about it except the fact that it happened, you know.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.680
Typical of Newport though.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:57.680
Well another gig that I put on was that crazy guy from America, Wayne County, before he came to Jane County.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.680
He was in the process of going through the hormone treatment and I had him at the Alexandria Club.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.680
He was doing one of his songs called Toilet Love or something, whatever.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.680
And he had his trousers down around his ankles and he was sending the whiteboard bum and everything that with toilet paper.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.680
And one of the ladies of the night came out of the toilet and seen him and she was a bit, I gassed about it all a bit.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.680
She was like, blah blah blah blah. And he threw the toilet paper at her.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.680
She went swinging his handbag at him.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.680
And it was just a kerfuffle about nothing and whatever but it was quite a funny moment.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.680
I remember when I was doing a gig at the St. Morris Church Hall.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.680
I can't remember the band but the band that I had booked didn't turn up.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.680
So I say to the crowd that did turn up, I played extra time.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.680
Next thing I know I'm playing Edgar Bolton's Out Demons Out.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.680
And then through the mist I seen the priest from the cathedral come marching into the hall.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.680
Robes flowing with Edgar Bolton blasting Out Demons Out.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.680
And I looked at my watch and I was like, oh shit.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.680
He was like half an hour later than I should have been.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.680
He came up and said, you're playing extra time, we've had complaints about the noise, blah blah blah.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:22.680
And I thought it was just hilarious that he should come in at that particular time and give me a bolligan.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.680
There's another time where two bands turned up at the St. Wallace Hall.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.680
I can't remember the band that I had booked but I do know that another band turned up called Gentle Giant.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.680
They were a brilliant band. They made one album I believe back in the late 60s.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.680
And they'd been double booked by the agent in London.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.680
And so I explained and they were quite happy to accept it.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.680
It was the agent's fault.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.680
But I did say that come on board and let's see what can be done and we'll split the money and whatever.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.680
But they said the stage was too small to get their equipment on and the other band.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.680
So it works either way. It's just show business. Shit happens.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:17.680
Well my biggest claim to fame is the fact that I brought Cherry Vanellaton who bought.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.680
And she's a lady from America.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.680
Well that night, yes, she did bring the police with her to use as a backing band I believe.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.680
It was the first ever British gig.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.680
She couldn't afford to bring her own band over.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.680
I believe the guitarist came with them.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.680
And the police was looking for work and she was looking for British musicians.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.680
So the police came with her.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.680
The police didn't have their sound at the time.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.680
They was like a jazz trio.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.680
And they went on that night and played first.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.680
And then Cherry came on with the guitarist and they all played together.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.680
She went off. The police came on and did another little set, another little jazz set.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.680
And then to finish it off, Cherry came back on and the police finished off the evening.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.680
They just had their single out called Fall Out.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.680
But they couldn't get much work on anything like that.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.680
The Argus wouldn't advertise them as known.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.680
They said we can't advertise that the police are going to be appearing at some club tonight.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.680
We'll have the chief constable down our neck.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.680
And I didn't put them on the poster because basically they were just a backing band.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.680
I paid her around a pound that night.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.680
She paid the band, the police, 15 quid.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.680
And they backed her on the first tour.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.680
But Newport was the first date.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.680
And it was their first ever gig.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.680
.
