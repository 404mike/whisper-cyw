00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.000
O thou wealth in us never end, O grandness that we bring.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:04.000
O little town of Bethlehem, How still we see thee high.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Above the deep and dreamless sleep Of silent stars for a while.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Yet in the dark streets shine again The everlasting light.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The books and things of all the years Are read in thee to write.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Born Christ is born of Mary, And gathered all above.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:02.000
While mortals sing the angels' key, Their watch of wondering love.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.000
The morning stars together proclaim the Holy Bird.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And praises sing to God the King, And peace to men on earth.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:36.000
O thou wealth in us never end, O grandness that we bring.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:46.000
The Thou wealth which we give of worth, Thy mercy not at sea.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Thou wealth of seven million hosts, We pay thee with the pen.
