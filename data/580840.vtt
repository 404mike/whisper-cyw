00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
The answer was better conditions, more room, more staff.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.600
You know, I mean, don't forget, I gather that the buildings in Hensel had been built in the 20s,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.600
apart from the beautiful castle that was already there, obviously,

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.040
but the wards were built around the 1920s, you know, and I mean, they were meant for, say,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.360
so many patients, but unfortunately the demand was greater than the supply,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.320
and these situations occurred.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.800
On the ward I worked on, in D ward, there were 50 odd patients to that ward,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.560
and there were probably no more than four staff on at any one time,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.320
so it was very unfair on both the staff and the patients.
