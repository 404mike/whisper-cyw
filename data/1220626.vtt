00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
There must have been massive changes in that synagogue from then to now.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The Swansea one.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Yes, well, we used to have regular services every week, every Friday night, every Saturday.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If anyone wanted, or was saying prayer for the dead on the anniversary of the death of the person involved,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
we'd have no problem whatsoever in getting a service together so that they could say prayers.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And generally, as I say, there was a lot of togetherness here.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If someone needed help, you would get it.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Right. Do you know what the membership used to be like here?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Used to be up to about 800. And now it's 40.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Okay, big difference. And I guess there's no... what happens if you want kosher meat, what do you do now?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We order it from London. It comes down to Cardiff, because Cardiff have got the same problem as us, they don't have a kosher butcher.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:36.000
We send a van up to London, which brings it down, drops off the meat in Cardiff, then comes our van from Swansea, picks it up from Cardiff.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Okay, yeah. And that's a regular arrangement?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
That's a regular arrangement.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Well, every four, five weeks.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So how... when you do your orders, do you... how is that all coordinated? Do you do it all with the butcher in direct or does someone support that?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
No, direct.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Yeah, we give the order to the butcher, and then he collates obviously all the orders, but the van comes from him, he comes to Cardiff, sometimes he goes to Bristol as well.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Yeah.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And then, say, our van, we pay for a van and a driver to go up to Cardiff. And then when... he always rings when he's leaving Cardiff, so we know what time to go down, he parks at a certain place, and usually the managers go down and pick it up.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And then you pay for it the following day with a card, you know, so...

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
But the main thing is that we also have kosher bread.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Yeah.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So in other words, for Friday night when you use a challah.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And growth series as well.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Yes.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Yes.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Okay. So all that's sorted every four weeks on the same ground?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Every four weeks, yes.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Okay.
