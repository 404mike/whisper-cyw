00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840
My grandfather, he was just a remarkable man. He was an extreme disciplinarian. He brought

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.800
my father unfortunately, I lost him during the war. I lived with my grandfather from

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.640
birth till I was 17 years of age. So in fact he was my father more than anybody else. He

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.760
was a disciplinarian. He was highly intelligent, very successful. I always remember when I

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.760
joined the British Army he wrote me a letter and the first thing he put on it was, remember

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.760
always to clean the welts of your shoes. I remember it to this day. He said because

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.240
when you're on parade the officers will look down and if you've got dirty welts. He taught

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.160
me manners. He taught me how to behave. Although I'm 80 years of age now, I'll never forget

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.160
it and he was a very strict but a good man. He had a very, very, very hard job. Times

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.720
you think about it now, he used to hand make all this mineral water, crates and crates

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.520
and crates of it. There were no heating, it was very difficult and he'd load up a horse

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.880
and cart or a lorry in the winter and then suddenly a frost would come, break all the

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.320
bottles. Can you imagine it? And hundreds of the hours and had to do it all again. He'd

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.840
open his shop on a Sunday morning and literally during the war the queues, a penny a bottle,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.880
tuppence a bottle, things like that. And I used to count all the pennies and literally

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.640
maybe a hundred pound he'd take on a Sunday morning which was all in pennies and tuppences.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.840
And eventually he got old and he died at the age of 69 and he sold the business then I

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.720
believe to a company, another mineral water company. But he was very shrewd and he had

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.080
a house in Dukestown, the factory was next to the house and next to the factory he let

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.360
out a huge building to the Cooperative Wholesale Society who used it as a food warehouse during

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.440
the war. Now my earliest memories as a child was in the middle of the night of police and

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.080
other people coming with little tins to get food and it was very, very interesting how

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.960
they all did it and he was so generous with people, you know. The house was called Hawthorne

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.080
House and it became a staging post for refugees fleeing from Nazi Germany and the continent.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.980
They used to come to Tredegar and I can remember them vividly with long beards and big hats

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.160
and couldn't speak English and they'd come to the house. My grandfather would give them

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.880
then a five pound note, clothing, send them then to the next post which was probably in

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.800
Birmingham then they'd do the same there and send them to Manchester and they'd disperse

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.640
themselves but they all came to Tredegar. My cousins and I, I'm sorry to say, used to

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.720
make fun of them and we used to call them Vishki Vashkis because they had such great

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.360
big whiskers, I've never forgotten it. And we also adopted a couple of children, my grandfather

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.080
did, we took them in, refugees. The house was always full of people. I don't think there

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.680
was never a period between 1942 and 1944, two years, three years, where the house wasn't

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.800
there. They had nine bedrooms, every night people were sleeping there and they had no

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.600
clothes, no they were in rags. How they came to, it is quite a story and a lot of them

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.080
became so successful in life afterwards but they were, they got out of Nazi Germany and

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.480
in fact in Merthyr Tidville there was a house there and I happened to know the gentleman

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.800
and he was doing some work in the house and he was stripping the walls and he had all

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.080
these names on this wall here and they were Jewish children who had written their names

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.080
on the wall and I believe the Jewish, the Kfarther Park Museum is trying to get those

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.280
names put in there. But the history, it means my grandparents were so much involved, you

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.080
know they were frightened to death that Hitler would invade because God knows we wouldn't

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.240
be here today if they had. And they did as much as they could and he wasn't on his own.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.720
Jewish people in Triniga, in Cardiff, all over South Wales were so good to the Jewish

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.120
refugees. I don't think it would happen today the way they, you know, they realised what

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.040
was going on. They couldn't believe what they were saying because there was no news

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:48.040
coming out of Germany like this. And this is very strange, my uncle who came from Czechoslovakia,

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.480
his father and his brother was a Rabbi in Cardiff and he married my aunt. He was fought

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.520
in the First World War, in the Second World War, he was decorated from Gadendry at Dunkirk

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.080
but he was still a Czech national. Now he married my aunt and he was waiting for his

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.640
nationalisation papers to come. I can remember vividly at the end of the war, 1945 this must

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.160
have been, how old was I? I was probably about seven. And there was such a scene in the house,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.560
he had a little baby, a telegram had arrived from the home office ordering him out of the

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.880
country to deport him because his nationalisation papers. My grandfather lifted up a telephone

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.980
and got through to an iron beaven who, my grandfather was a mentor of his and who supported

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.080
him very much and within hours it had all been put right and of course, but it was a

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.360
terrible shock at that time. He was very much involved with the Labour Party, my grandfather,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.480
he was a tremendous socialist and I think he turned in his grave if he saw what was

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.160
happening today. And my mother in fact was a great friend of Jenny Lee so the association

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.560
goes back and it even goes back to me because when I was a young boy and we come to one

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.200
of the things here, I was educated in a Jewish school in London because there was no schooling,

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.520
no ministers, we used to have a Rabbi come over the mountains from Abedai to teach my

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.800
cousin and myself Hebrew which he did and my grandfather taught me but Jewish boys at

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.000
the age of 13 as you know get bar mitzvah and I had to go to a Jewish school to get

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.720
the knowledge. Now we had one particular day we went to the House of Commons and who should

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.960
I see was an iron beaven and I went up to him, much to the astonishment of the school

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.440
and he picked me up when I mentioned to him I was from Tredegar, a couple of weeks later

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.640
we had an invite from him to my school, invited myself and three of my friends to have tea

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.140
with him.
