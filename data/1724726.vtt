00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.720
But what I do find as I flick through my Facebook is that sometimes it's shown as to be a surprise

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:28.480
that people with a learning disability have relationships. So I'm going through my social

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.120
media sometimes or on the internet and it's like saying oh this person and this person's

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.560
having a relationship and I'm like thinking and they're celebrating that and I'm thinking

00:00:42.720 --> 00:01:03.440
Yeah fine celebrate it but it's normal and it's like, I don't know, I'm sounding a bit cloudy here but yeah it's like why not because everyone else does.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:16.560
It's nothing like, obviously everyone's capable of it and they make it sound as if like it's a big achievement.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:27.840
I mean yeah it could be an achievement but it's like they make it sound as if they wasn't capable of doing that in the first place.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.200
So then it's like okay and then obviously everyone's capable of everything.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:46.560
I mean stuff people are capable of doing maybe and not everyone can do everything but you can have a go.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.360
Do you think people with a learning disability do find it more difficult to have relationships?

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:04.640
Do you think that's why they might be celebrating it or do you think, I mean I agree that it should be seen as normal shouldn't it?

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.140
Yeah.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.080
But do you think people do have to, that it's more difficult for people with a learning disability or not?

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:20.400
I think it could and couldn't be. I think yes and no because I think it could be difficult

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:32.080
in a way that if somebody was married they would have to maybe have a support worker

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.520
to help them with their bills, help them with the legal stuff, help them maybe to cook or to clean

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.400
or to like you know care or something but that shouldn't be a barrier and

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.440
even people without a learning disability they have support workers and carers too.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:06.720
So also I think if people with a learning disability have relationships I think that is

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:20.640
could be easy, it could be easy because on the, not on the whole but

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:33.280
I think sometimes or quite often maybe a lot people with learners learning disability

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:47.040
they don't hide themselves away and you know like your feelings and you just tell us and they're honest and

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.520
yeah basically like obviously

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.680
I don't know if this sounds weird but I think people with learning disability are more honest

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.200
on the whole maybe in a weird sort of way, not a weird sort of way but they could be more honest than

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:18.080
mainstream people and I don't want to call them mainstream people anymore but as people without

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:26.640
people without a learning disability then because obviously if you're having a bad day with

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:40.240
learning disability it's easier to tell so and also it's harder for people I'm just guessing this

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.320
I think it's harder with a learning person with a learning disability to make a lie and

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.680
that's because it's um

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:08.720
because basically they tell it as it is you know yes they I found this in a lot of places and a lot of

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:17.040
and a lot of people watching that people do get more honest and passionate about it

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.120
and then that's why they tell it as it is yeah
