00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.740
The Last of the Flock by William Wordsworth

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.320
Read by Tim McMullen for the BBC

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.200
In distant countries I have been,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.980
And yet I have not often seen a healthy man,

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.360
A man full grown, weep in the public roads alone.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.820
But such a one, on English ground,

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.600
And in the broad highway I met,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.040
Along the broad highway he came,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.400
His cheeks with tears were wet,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.400
Sturdy he seemed, though he was sad,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.840
And in his arms a lamb he had.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.520
He saw me and he turned aside,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.680
As if he wished himself to hide,

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.680
Then with his coat he made a say,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.440
To wipe those briny tears away.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.080
I followed him and said,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.240
My friend, what ails you?

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.600
Wherefore weep you so?

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.920
Shame on me, sir, this lusty lamb,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.600
He makes my tears to flow.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.440
Today I fetched him from the rock,

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.840
He is the last of all my flock.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.040
When I was young, a single man,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.320
And after youthful follies ran,

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.760
Though little given to care and thought,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.400
Yet so it was, a yew I bought,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.920
And other sheep from her I raised,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.480
As healthy sheep as yew might see.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.840
And then I married, and was rich as I could wish to be.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.400
Of sheep I numbered a full score,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.560
And every year increased my store,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.200
Year after year my stock it grew,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.360
And from this one, this single yew,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.360
Full fifty comely sheep I raised,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.120
As sweet a flock as ever grazed,

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.400
Upon the mountain they did feed,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.560
They throve, and we at home did thrive,

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.960
This lusty lamb of all my store,

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.600
Is all that is alive.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.800
And now I care not if we die,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.720
And perish all of poverty.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.360
Ten children, sir, had I to feed,

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.280
Hard labor in a time of need,

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.840
My pride was tamed,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.000
And in our grief I of the perish asked relief.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.200
They said I was a wealthy man,

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.720
My sheep upon the mountain fed,

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.040
And it was fit that thence I took

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.520
Whereof to buy us bread.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.640
Do this, how can we give to you, they cried,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.880
What to the poor is due.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.400
I sold a sheep, as they had said,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.920
And bought my little children bread,

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.480
And they were healthy with their food.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.040
For me, it never did me good,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.760
A woeful time it was for me

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.240
To see the end of all my gains,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.080
The pretty flock which I had reared

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.400
With all my care and pains,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.040
To see it melt like snow away.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.760
For me, it was a woeful day.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.720
Another still, and still another,

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.640
A little lamb, and then its mother,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.240
It was a vein that never stopped,

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.160
Like blood drops from my heart they dropped,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.320
Till thirty were not left alive.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.080
They dwindled, dwindled one by one,

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.120
And I may say that many a time

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.560
I wished they all were gone.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.800
They dwindled one by one away.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.080
For me, it was a woeful day.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.760
To wicked deeds I was inclined,

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.080
And wicked fancies crossed my mind,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.040
And every man I chanced to see,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.240
I thought he knew some ill of me.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.800
No peace, no comfort could I find,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.360
No ease, with indoors or without.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.600
And crazily and wearily I went my work about,

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.560
Of times I thought to run away.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.640
For me, it was a woeful day.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.440
Sir, it was a precious flock to me,

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.080
As dear as my own children be,

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.160
For daily with my growing store

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.160
I loved my children more and more.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.080
Alas, it was an evil time.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.200
God cursed me in my sore distress.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.160
I prayed, yet every day I thought

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.320
I loved my children less,

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.440
And every week and every day my flock,

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.800
It seemed to melt away.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.120
They dwindled, sir, sad sight to see,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.160
From ten to five, from five to three,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.160
A lamb, a weather, and a yew,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.680
And then at last from three to two.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.040
And of my fifty yesterday I had but only one,

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.640
And here it lies upon my arm.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.720
Alas, and I have none.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.320
Today I fetched it from the rock.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.240
It is the last of all my flock.
