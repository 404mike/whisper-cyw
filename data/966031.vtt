00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Well, basically, normally most of the time, all the rooms only have single beds in,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
so all they've done is pushed two single beds together.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But because of the framework on the outside, it leaves quite a gap in between the two beds,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so it's not an ideal situation.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You know, we basically have to roll up another quilt.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It's like a quilted blanket, isn't it?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And we roll that up and slide that down.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But it's still not ideal, but it's better than nothing at all.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
What do you need in order to just have a double bed?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We need two profilers, or the two sides that profile,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
but both sides need to be able to raise up so that they can gather hoists underneath.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I know they are available, but I also know they carry a pretty price tag.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So would you have to pay for that, or would the council have to pay?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
No, we would.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We would have to pay, unfortunately.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
How does it feel having to sleep in that situation?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Soul strain.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
You can't lie next to your husband at night

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and even do something simple like fall asleep with your head in his chest.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
No simple things that most people take for granted in a normal double bed.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We miss that.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And we're not even talking about the intimate side of it.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
That is the icing on the cake.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I mean, that can be got round in a hammock if you feel that way inclined,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
but it is just, like Steve said, the very basic things of watching a film

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and putting your arms around each other.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Just lots of little things really.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Just stop for a minute.
