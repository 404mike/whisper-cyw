WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560
We were both recruited to a project called Play Our Way, which was a leisure based project

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:15.120
working with kids and we met for the first time to go to Mencap Conference.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.280
It was horrible.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.000
So we hadn't met each other before but neither of us had met anybody else in the team before

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.280
and we were just we were putting a car together as our introduction.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.280
How did that feel?

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.280
It was like, I don't know.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.280
Were you like, because I know now that that's your worst nightmare but what were you thinking about beforehand?

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.280
What did you feel beforehand?

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.280
It was this stranger. I had to sit by for like an hour and a half.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:05.600
It was cool because you made me talk and then you made me relaxed, I think is the right word.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.560
So yeah.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.440
What did you talk about?

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.720
Cool. Lots of stuff.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.800
I have no idea.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:24.080
Just, well, it was more about music and like films and what your general interests,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.080
like what our general interests was.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.280
And the second week of working with Jen, I gave her my graffiti bag.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.760
She dropped some coffee on.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.720
Did I?

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.040
Stick the pages in the middle together.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.240
I'm really sorry. I forgot that.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.740
Yeah.
