Interview with Mrs. Edminton

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Interview with Mrs. Edminton

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Interview with Mrs. Edminton

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Interview with Mrs. Edminton

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Interview with Mrs. Edminton

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Interview with Mrs. Edminton

Interview with Mrs. Edminton

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Interview with Mrs. Edminton

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Mr. Hagerman

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Mr. Hagerman

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So, there you are. It started as a very informal chat between Jack and myself.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And I've had to carry on ever since. Nobody else seemed to want to take over.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:19.000
But my greatest problem throughout the years has been getting Welsh recordings.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
They're not very plentiful here.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And it has been a problem. Though since my visit to Wales in 1973,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I fortunately was able to obtain some recordings.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And I should mention here that many recordings which were available were not worthy of broadcast.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And CKUA is very, very particular as to the quality.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
So unfortunately, some of the discs I had were just not worthy of broadcast.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:08.000
However, we've worried through. And I'm happy to say that I do get much encouragement.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
There are times when I feel it's not quite worth the effort.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:21.000
And then all of a sudden I either receive mail or telephone calls from the most unexpected places.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And I think it would be of interest for people to know that non-Welsh people seem to be terribly interested in this program.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And for this reason, I do a great deal of research and try to explain the traditions of Wales,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:57.000
particularly the musical parts such as the gamamba, the ysdewod, noson lawan, and that type of thing.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And of course, I describe the countryside.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And one of my greatest thrills two years ago was to go into a shoe store in Edmonton.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And the clerk said, You must be Mrs. Len Williams. I had never seen the man before.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And I said, Good gracious, how did you know that?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Well, he said, I recognize your voice.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And he said, I'm so glad that I've had this opportunity of speaking with you,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
because I'd like you to know that my Canadian-born wife, he was an Englishman, by the way,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:44.000
insisted that they go to the Llangollen Ysdewod and to the Royal National Ysdewod that particular year.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
It was about two or three years ago.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:55.000
After my explanation of these festivals and describing them.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.000
So there was one instance where I felt it was well worth the effort I put into it.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
I've also had some interesting interviews.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:19.000
A few years back, I had the famous North American American, Welsh American baritone, Thomas L. Thomas.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And he was a delightful person to interview.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000
He was here in Edmonton having a concert, holding a concert on our Celebrity Series,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:38.000
which brought all the stars across the continent, really, on the series Celebrity Concerts.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
It wasn't in any way connected with the Welsh society.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
But I had this interview with Mr. Thomas.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And I also had a very interesting interview with Mr. John Williams Hughes of Maryam Glass, Anglesey,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:03.000
who is a very distant relative of my husband's and a well-known lecturer in the United States

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:10.000
and well-known in Wales and throughout Britain as a broadcaster and a journalist.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
John spent a weekend with us.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And he was one that I also interviewed.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
I'm sorry I'm not going to be interviewing you, Glenys.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000
I do my next program on the 11th of July.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And of course at that time I'll be giving details of the Gammanbagany in Penocha,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:41.000
which is now becoming quite an institution in Alberta.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:54.000
We have Gammanbagany in Edmonton each year, usually in the winter over our 1st of March celebrations.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
This year we had it on the 28th of April.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And we had Mr. Edwell Parry, our conductor.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
He was also an international figure.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
He's known in Wales as well as in the United States.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And the annual summer Gammanbagany will be in Penocha in August.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000
So these are things that are always of interest to broadcast to the people.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And you managed to get over to the Canadian in Edmonton,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
a little of the Welsh tradition and the Welsh way of life.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Well, I find that is so.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.000
When I first started, I was absolutely amazed to find that people couldn't believe

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
that we had a language of our own.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And that we had so many wonderful seats of learning in Wales,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000
the various colleges, the Aberystwyth and Bangor, and of course the University in Cardiff and so on.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:04.000
And I was greatly encouraged to go into that angle as well as the music.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Now the program is introduced as the music and tradition of Wales.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
So it gives me great scope.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
But nevertheless it takes a great deal of research as well.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And I do all the research and the arranging of the programs.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And also commenting. I do the commentaries.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And what more can I say about it now?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
How long have you been in Canada?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Well, you're putting me on the spot. I'm certainly going to be dating myself.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I came out here with my mother and my younger sister in 1914.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Our father had come out the year before.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And therefore we rather consider our parents in something of the light of pioneers here.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Certainly Edmonton wasn't the metropolis that it is now.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:11.000
But you would be interested to know that even then there was a very active Welsh church here.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:19.000
We had a Welsh minister and it was connected with a Presbyterial in the United States.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And the church flourished until, oh I would say, the early 1920s.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And then it seemed to drift into a society more than the church services.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And the Welsh Society of Edmonton has gone on continuously since then.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
We've had our ups and downs with membership.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
We hope that we struggle along regardless.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Some years we go along with a very encouraging membership.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And all of a sudden it will dwindle down and then come back again.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000
So we've been very active this last 10 or 12 years.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And have sponsored the Gordraraan Choir here.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And various concerts of course.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
We have a St. David's Welsh male voice choir here.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Though in latter years I'm afraid there are not too many Welsh speaking gentlemen in this group.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
But it's a fairly active group here.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And what about the Welsh language?
