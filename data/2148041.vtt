WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080
So of course, yeah, I'm going to run through a few questions and feel free to share more

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.920
or less however you feel with the questions.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.520
So just the first one, can you tell us your name please?

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.520
Mrs. May Lida.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.520
Where and when were you born?

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.640
In Rochers, 4th of July 1946.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.080
Do you speak another language as well?

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.840
We speak the patois and the French.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.440
Are you able to also introduce yourself in terms of your name and where you were born

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.440
in patois or French?

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.440
In French, yeah.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.440
Okay.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.440
Je m'appelle Madame May Lida et je suis née à L'Hémorice en 1946.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:56.320
J'ai 5 enfants et j'habite à Newport à présent.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.080
Do you remember the area that you grew up in?

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.080
Bobassa.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.080
Bobassa, okay.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.080
And what was it like growing up there?

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.160
It's this village, quiet, people know each other.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.880
Those days life was just easy going.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.600
We didn't know what it's like to have worry.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.880
I didn't have to go to work.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:26.280
I was in school, just running around after school, coming home.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.600
We were just happy, easy going.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.080
We get along with the neighbours.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.560
It's a lot of family to get together.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.440
Every Sunday we're never home.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.840
We can, we either by the sea or go to church on the pilgrim day.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.600
And we have a picnic so that was a routine every Sunday.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.800
Different beaches every week.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.840
And weddings and parties, always something at the weekend, never boat.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.840
No.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.520
What was your favourite memory as a child?

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:05.880
School, going to school, going to church, singing the choir, going for rehearsal.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.920
I was in the girls guide as well so we did that Saturday morning.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.800
We had to go for meetings.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.920
So it was good.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.520
And what about the opposite?

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.200
What's the fondest memory of your childhood?

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.360
Is there something else that you didn't really enjoy in your childhood?

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.600
Well, my mum died.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.240
I was seven and I didn't know my father.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.400
And we lived with my grandmother then when my mum died in her house.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.720
And then my grandmother moved.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.680
I moved with my great grandmother until I was eleven.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.680
She died.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.480
So I went back to my maternal grandmother.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.600
We lived with her until I met my husband.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.400
We got married and we came here.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.400
So that was a short childhood I think.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.520
Everything went so quick from there.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.960
How old was you when you married?

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.400
I don't know, I was seventeen because he had to leave the country.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.240
And then when we came here we had a religious, because we had to have a civil marriage.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.400
And we hadn't been a minor those days.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.800
You're not allowed to get married without consent.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.880
So we just had a quick civil marriage.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.680
And when we came to Newport we had a religious marriage.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:37.960
So of course then, what type of celebrations can you also remember as a child?

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.840
Wedding, being bridesmaid.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.960
Every wedding, every family would be asked to be bridesmaid.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.040
It was good fun, dressing up, it was nice.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.400
And what type of traditions would you say are different within those types of weddings

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.480
towards the Western forms of weddings?

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.840
Well here, if you go to a wedding the organisation is not the same.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.200
It's not like family orientated.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.960
Everybody isn't united, it's all different.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.120
They stay in their corner and they don't like converse.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.600
But not like at home, no way.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:26.440
Since you come in you're meeting people and you have your toast, the bride and groom dance.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.960
And then we'll be dancing till four o'clock in the morning before we go home.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.560
What type of customs in terms of like, is there music, is there drumming?

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:42.920
We did modern music like ballroom dancing.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.280
And then we got our original dance which is the Sega, come from Africa.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.440
That's our national dance.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.080
But then you keep that till the end.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.960
But in the beginning it's the walls and the slow and a bit of a mix.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.120
So the Sega come at the end when it's the final then.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.160
Near the end of the reception.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.280
Was there any kind of other celebrations that you enjoy too?

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.120
Well it's always been dinner party on a Sunday.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:21.960
It could be a christening, it could be a holy communion, or engagement.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.120
Or just going for a picnic on a beach.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:35.240
What was that like as well, having water very very close to you and a part of your childhood?

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.920
We like paddling but none of us like to swim.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:46.200
We just paddle and some are good swimmers but there's been a couple of deaths.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.240
So that's put me off when we see your friends drown.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.360
That's put me off that is going in deep.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:04.280
So then if we were moving over to travel into the UK you said you travelled through marriage and you come straight to Newport?

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.720
Yes straight to Newport.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.720
Why was that?

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:13.480
When my husband came, his uncle was in London, his cousin was already here.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.480
1962 he got married and came here.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.560
The thing is his father-in-law used to work on a boat and another friend from Mauritius.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.040
So when they docked in Newport it was a nice place to settle.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:35.400
So they stayed here and when he was coming his cousin said you don't need to go to London in a flat.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.800
I already got a house in Bill.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.480
So he had a room with them so this is where we stayed.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:48.040
But we commute, family in France, London and it was fun.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.000
They like coming to Wales, the park, the beach, we take them out.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.400
And they love it, the countryside.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.200
We were not all in one place.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.440
So when we see each other it was nice.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.200
And then you go home and then you see each other again.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.920
So it was good like that.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.920
That's 1962 then?

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.960
No.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.840
Your cousin was in 1962?

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.880
He came first, my husband came in 1964.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.880
He is already settled in Newport.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.120
And you came in 1964?

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.120
I came after 1965.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.520
And did you have any expectations of the UK before you came?

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.480
No.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.480
Didn't even know where I was going.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.480
Just calling the place.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.480
How did that feel as well actually?

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.480
It was a bit sad.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.480
It was on my own mind.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:47.160
And when I got to London we got to come to Newport by train.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.160
I haven't got a clue of where Newport was.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.800
And my husband never told me.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.800
And he just sit there and I see people getting off.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.800
And I'm thinking, where is Newport?

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.800
He didn't say nothing.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.800
Everybody's getting off.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.800
It was a small train those days.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.800
He stopped at Caldy Court, something, something.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.800
And I'm going, where is Newport?

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.800
He didn't say nothing.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.800
He was laughing.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.800
And then finally we got to Newport.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.800
And the high street was a lot of people going up and down.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.440
And then we walked from the train station to town.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.440
And I think there's buses there.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.440
We go to Peel and I can't remember that bit.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.440
But I could see a lot of people walking.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.440
It was nice.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.440
Different.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.440
It was strange.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.440
But I make friends.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.440
Because I am very talkative and not shy.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.440
And so the landlord was Asian.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.440
And they speak to me.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.080
And they say, how come you speak English?

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.080
And I said, well, I only left school a year ago to get married.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.080
Oh, yeah, so I was teaching them English.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.080
So we became friends since then.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:03.080
Even if they see me now, they're like, oh, hello lady.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.080
Remember you?

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.080
They all know me.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.080
Yeah, they remember.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.080
So it sounds as if you had loads of opportunities which you took in order to settle in.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.720
So that made him a bit more comfortable being here now?

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.720
Otherwise I would have been lonely.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.720
It was only a bedside man we had.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:25.720
And when my husband said to me to go to the post office, I said, where's the post office?

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.720
He said, there's only one main road.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.720
You won't get lost.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.720
And he said, just take the main road and then come back.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.720
Oh my God.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.720
This is how I learn.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.720
And I know.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:46.360
You said you spoke about that bit of sadness of having to leave home.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.360
What would you say was the most important thing that you had to leave behind?

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.360
My grandmother.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.360
She was old.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:10:02.360
Now she wanted probably see me and my family very often but being the distance.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.360
We couldn't go.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.360
I went to see her once and then she died after.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Very similar to my staff as well.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Same thing.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
I went and then it was time for her to go.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
With your grandmother as well, because you grew up living at your grandmother's house.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Did I give you that opportunity in the space to learn loads of the traditions and learn more about your culture as well?

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Because your grandmother was the one teaching you.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:45.640
Well, since teachers have begun to go to church, you know, the right way we learn to do housework.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.640
Because that's the main thing a girl ought to learn.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:55.640
Because if she gets married she's got to learn to cook and clean and teach all the basics.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:04.280
So you lost her one day because she did say to me, I am not getting any younger, you know.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:10.280
So you got to do all that and then to survive.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.280
So then coming here then?

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.280
That's the only reason she agreed for me to come here.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.280
Because she said if anything happens to her, where would I go?

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:30.920
And I was just going to say, so you were kind of equipped and being able to be here and fend and live for yourself because you had been taught how to do so.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:36.920
And how was that as well then after you had settled in to Newport?

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:42.920
What can you say was kind of the best things about being in Newport and even the worst as well?

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.920
One, as you said, coming here and then why you settled in in Newport?

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:53.560
Because my husband got a job there, he never thought of moving.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:59.560
Because everything was so close, like hospitals, schools, you just have to walk.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:05.560
But if I lived in London I would have had to learn to catch buses and underground.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:13.560
Because I come from a village, just walk and catch the bus to go visit friends, family on a Sunday.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:22.200
That was the tradition, you had to go and visit your family and have a chat, something to eat and come back.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.200
But I said if I live in London, how am I going to go shopping?

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:32.200
So I stayed in Newport because I felt more settled here.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:38.200
I could walk the children to school, come home, do my shopping by the time they come home.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.840
If I had a doctor's appointment, it was only down the road.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.840
If I had to go to the hospital, it was only 20 minutes walk from my house.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.840
So it was quite handy.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:54.840
But his heart was in London where all his uncles, sisters were.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:00.840
And we tried to move but we looked at the price of houses because he had a job in Dagenham.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:06.840
He was commuting, coming home and staying with my brother-in-law in Arsenal.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.480
We did look at the houses, they were not suitable.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:17.480
And the children said, no we are not leaving our schools, so we never move.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:27.480
Did that give you the space again to start teaching the children about your ways and upskilling them as well?

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.480
Always, yes.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.480
That's why I took Jordan to see how we lived.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.480
Not everybody got to story houses.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.120
My family is still poor, living in bungalow.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:44.120
So they appreciate life a bit better.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:50.120
And we don't come from story houses, you know, with washing machine and all.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.120
I showed them in the river where people are still washing.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.120
And people in the house still washing on the stone, you call it?

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.120
You wash your clothes by hands.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.760
I fell off one and there is the poor one.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.760
So I showed them how I was growing up.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.760
What kind of my life was.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:18.760
Not luxury, you know, climbing mango trees, running around barefoot, you know.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.760
So they appreciated them, so they know the culture.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:28.760
Otherwise they think we all got big houses because it's not like that.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:37.400
Was that obvious as well when you came here in terms of the upbringing of the children and the young people because they didn't have that?

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.400
Was that obvious?

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.400
Yes.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:49.400
And maybe again, there might be an obvious response to it, but do you feel that that's what also gave you resilience because you knew exactly where you come from?

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.400
Yes, and you never forget.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.400
Another child, the way you were brought up.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.400
It was the best time really.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.040
You can never go back to this type of life again.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.040
It's not the same, it's moving too fast now.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.040
Very, very, very fast.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:16.040
And even about moving fast, what do you think is important about the next generation or our children to learn and to know?

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.040
How to live modest.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.040
Don't forget their roots.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.680
Always be there.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.680
If you keep your roots, you won't go wrong in life.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.680
Don't follow the bad way.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.680
Follow your family way.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.680
The old-fashioned way is the best, I think.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.680
Did that also remain strong because you were visiting your families?

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.680
Yes.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.680
And how did you feel about the experience?

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.680
I was very happy.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.680
I was very happy.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.680
I was very happy.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.680
I was very happy.

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.680
I was very happy.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.680
I was very happy.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.320
How was visiting your families?

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.320
I know you said even when you were here...

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.320
If I don't go there, not everybody can come and see me.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.320
You see?

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.320
So they look forward to seeing me.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.320
Some are very old.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.320
Some are very poor.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.320
Some have never lived in the house.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.320
So the only time they see me is when I go and see them.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.320
See?

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.320
That's why I try and make an effort.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.320
Because every time I've gone, somebody has died.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.320
It didn't have to be all younger than myself.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.320
Every year I've gone.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.960
Every year I've gone, we've lost so many members of the family.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.960
Do you feel the children are doing that as well now?

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.960
I hope so when I'm not here.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.960
I hope they keep the tradition.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.960
Yeah.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.960
I hope so.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:39.960
Because you then get to connect and share stories, especially if it's how fast-paced things are going now.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.960
Well, they think it's a paradise.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.960
Blue sea and sky. I said, no, you live there first.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.960
And then you see if it's a paradise.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.960
That is hardship, you know?

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.960
What would you say you love most about your culture?

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.960
We were brought up with respect.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:01.960
We were taught to respect.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.960
We were sociable.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.960
You know, socialising all the time.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.960
Any time, any occasion.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.960
You don't need an excuse to have a get-together.

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:22.600
And most of all, you live, what you call it, a right way, like law-abiding.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.600
We don't break any rules.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:30.600
We don't, you know, go into drugs, into fights and things like this.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:36.600
Just live modest and peaceful and happy.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.600
I agree.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:45.240
What elements of your culture have you made an effort to preserve?

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.240
If there's still the traditions we were just talking about, going to visit others.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:55.240
Are there other customs or language of food or even types of celebrations?

00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:01.240
Food is a multicultural country.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.240
You have every kind of food.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.240
Every nationality, we all live as one.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:11.880
Everybody has different religions.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.880
But when we're together, we are as one.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.880
That's the way it's been.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.880
And I hope they keep it that way, don't divide.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:29.880
So that's one of the things to preserve, is to carry on the multicultural embracing of that.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.880
Very true.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.520
What type of things have you done in order?

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:40.520
Do you still do to preserve and to carry on the multicultural connections?

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:46.520
I teach the children, even if they don't believe in God, sometimes go to church.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:52.520
It's nice to believe in something, you know, because one day you need him.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.520
You don't have to be really just up to your neck.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.520
I'm not saying that.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.160
You can take the good in something and follow the right path.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.160
Because there's two paths in life.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:07.160
You can take the bad one, like I said to them, and you can take the good one.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.160
That is good friends and that is bad friends.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.160
So I've always teach them just follow the right way.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.160
And we'll go wrong then.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.160
I agree.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:23.160
Thank you for sharing that as well.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.160
I just wanted to speak a little bit about Age Alive, of course.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:33.800
Can you describe how, from your journey, because while you were here you were working and teaching as you said.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.800
No, teaching.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.800
English?

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.800
No.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.800
I never worked when I came here.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.800
I had the family first.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.800
And then time was getting a bit hard.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.800
Landward, my husband was working.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.800
Every year there'd be a strike.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:55.800
So my neighbour said to me one day, they're asking for people in Grumpton batteries.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.440
To work, are you interested?

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.440
I said, do you not remember work?

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.440
What do I know about work?

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.440
I'm a teenager, I come in this country, I got married, I've got a family.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.440
I only know how to cook and wash.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.440
He introduced me to the catering.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:20.440
Somebody was on the sick and they took me on to cover.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:24.440
And they teach me everything from A, who's a nice old lady there.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.080
They got to know me and they liked me.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.080
And I liked my money then.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:33.080
So when the lady came back after sick, so I had to leave.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.080
It was a bit sad then.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:43.080
And soon after, because I had no phone those days, one of the Jamaican Mrs. Carnegie,

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.080
she came and knocked on my door and she said, would you come back?

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.080
They all like you.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.080
So I'd been there and I worked.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.080
And I was very happy.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.720
So I'd been there and I worked ever since.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.720
Is that Lorna?

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.720
Mrs. Carnegie, she's in the home now.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.720
Slim, not Lorna.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.720
I was thinking Robert's mother.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.720
Robert's Carnegie's mother.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.720
Elaine?

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.720
Something like that.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.720
So I never knew because years ago we called each other Mrs. Carnegie.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.720
That's all I know.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.360
So when I started working, I worked until I retired then.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.360
And when I retired, I was lost.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:24.360
And of course my husband died in the process.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.360
So I thought what am I supposed to do now?

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.360
Because I used to work weekend.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:32.360
If somebody wanted the time of New Year, I used to cover because the children then was

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.360
old enough to cook.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.360
If you tell Andrew, I'm going to cook.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.360
I'm going to cook.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.360
I'm going to cook.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.360
I'm going to cook.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.360
I'm going to cook.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
If you tell Andrew, now he used to have a job to do if you ask him.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
He had a job to do when I go to work.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
So they all manage.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
And then I could come home and finish off and we have dinner.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
So I used to cover everybody who wanted time off because they had babies.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
So even Christmas and New Year I used to go.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
It's only part time then.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000
And so when that happened and I retired, I'd seen a friend of mine in PIL.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.640
And she said to me, what are you doing now?

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.640
I said, I'm checking the thing.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.640
Oh, she said, come with me.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:23.640
I'll show you where I go on Wednesday.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.640
St. Mary's Hall.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.640
And she introduced me to Roy.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.640
And Mrs. Hillel was there.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.640
And she said, do you know who that is?

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.640
I said, well, that's Andre's mother.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.640
You see, I can't go anywhere.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.640
People don't see.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:41.640
So they were, since then I just, I took to them and they took to me.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.280
And I'm still here now.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:48.280
And he got me out of the house, take me places I haven't been.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:52.280
Because we never had a chance to go anywhere when the kids were school.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:56.280
And places even in England we haven't seen.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:00.280
So now I've got the opportunity to go around.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.280
So what does that mean to you as well then?

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:08.280
Being able to see these places and now that you've come?

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.920
I'm very grateful because I didn't know those places existed.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.920
Things I didn't do when I was young.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.920
You know, coming here at such a young age.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:22.920
And now I've seen a bit of life, I think.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.920
A bit of fun as well.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.920
You know, when you're scooping a house, a housewife and go to work.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.920
All you know is housework, feeding and going out as a family.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.920
But never been out on my own or anything.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.920
It's a new experience to me.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:41.560
Being able to stand on my own feet now, see.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:49.560
It's great to hear as well and to see how it factored into the fact that you said you had the household and working all that time.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.560
Didn't have that opportunity.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:55.560
So now as it's come it's beautiful to see as well.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:01.560
Was there one or two moments or events that stand out in each of your life?

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.560
Yeah, we've done Black History, we've done, I've done a play.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:10.200
Roy, we've done a couple of plays.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.200
Okay, I would see one, yeah.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.200
We love to see the, I don't know if he's got a video, we were on stage a couple of times, yeah.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.200
How was that experience?

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:22.200
At first I thought I can't do it, I won't remember the lines.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:28.200
So after we done it, it was okay.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.200
Did you do it again?

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:34.200
I said to him, you know, I'm going to see now, I won't remember everything.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:48.840
And you've said a little bit actually, well quite a fair amount, but how do you think Age Alive supports Black Asian or other minority or majority of over 50s?

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:56.840
Oh, Age Alive has brought a lot of Caribbean people together and because we're diverse, any nationality comes in.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:09.480
I think they learn a lot from the group, things they didn't do like me, they didn't know, they didn't have the opportunity to go out, like women only.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:15.480
So I think it's done a great advantage for them all, yeah, they've opened our eyes really.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:23.480
That's again fantastic to hear and to see these parts of the stories.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:30.120
Within regards to the family, is there any kind of family heirlooms, like photographs or ornaments that you have?

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:36.120
The trouble is I've lost, I had a picture of my grandmother, I don't know where it is.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:52.120
You see what happened is when it was bad weather, the house was leaking and I think my grandmother's lost a lot of possession, photograph of me, even my mother, I don't know if there's anything left, nothing.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:26:06.120
Is there anything that your children have of you that you want them or they should be keeping in terms of memories or ornaments that are connected to you?

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:14.120
They got my photograph when I was my passport and my holy communion.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:20.120
My mum made that before she died because she was a good dressmaker, that's the only thing.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.760
Are you able to learn how to make some dresses as well then?

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:31.760
That's the trouble, I didn't. I was too young when she died, otherwise I would have been a good dressmaker.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:38.760
Because for a living, every woman had to learn to sew, that was their way of living.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.400
They didn't go out to work unless you're a maid.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:49.400
So that's why they're made, what do you call it, earnings.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:27:00.400
That's all the questions, I don't know if there's anything else you wanted to share or any messages or anything like that that you wanted to share at all.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:14.040
Well, you know my grandson and you can see by looking at him that he's been brought up, my husband has taught him a good, like he was brought up.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:25.040
So he wants them to do the same, look, he's put his mind into weight lifting and as you know yourself, he's not going out gambling,

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:34.680
he's not getting involved in any gambling because that's what my husband used to say to them, the right way and your family honour.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:39.680
Don't put shame in a family, don't give your family a bad name.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:49.680
So as you see now, that is how they're growing up, that's how they're following the footpaths of their grandfather, what he's been injecting to them.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:57.320
And if you speak to Mario, he'll tell you, they say me was strict and they respect that.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:01.320
Their father would teach them the right way, you know.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:10.320
Because even now people respect you, you know, everywhere you go they say, oh this family was good, I used to go and play with their children,

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:16.320
I used to go in their house, they used to feed me, you know what I mean, that's, we've kept a good reputation.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:23.960
You know what I mean? So you speak to them, you can see for yourself, the example they've had.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.960
Thank you, thank you very much.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:29.960
Thank you, thank you very much.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:33.960
So you can tell Jordan now I've praised him.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.960
I will too.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:41.960
And his dad as well, he doesn't smoke, my husband did have a cigar once a year, that's all, Christmas.

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.600
And everybody likes his drinks, but Mario don't drink now.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:56.600
But you know, the family man, Mario's a good father, and he's teaching his children now to be like his dad.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:02.600
You know, he don't like it if they're smoking and drinking, so it's only Shane who smokes, he tells him off.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:09.600
Look after your health, you know what I mean, but you can see the way he is, this is how my husband was with them.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.240
That's very, very, very clear.
