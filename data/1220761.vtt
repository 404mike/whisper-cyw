WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
You've done some charitable work as well.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.360
Yes.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.360
Tell me more about that.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.920
Well, I've belonged to Wheatsow for quite a long time.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.880
And where was the Wheatsow?

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.560
Well, here we used to have it in different people's houses.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.680
Eventually the organisation that I belonged to called Betty Silver, we got older and older

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.920
and it was the same people taking office all the time.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.200
So it was rather difficult.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.480
So now I belong to a younger group.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.840
So what happened to Betty Silver's group?

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.520
Did it just fade away?

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.520
Well, yes.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.520
Yes.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.520
And who was it?

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.520
A lot of people, they were no longer living.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.320
It was rather sad, but we did very well.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.760
And who was Betty Silver?

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.240
She was one of the original members as far as I know.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.080
You're going back before I belonged.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.560
And so they, I think it was originally called the Friendship Club.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.360
And then they called it Betty Silver after her.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.560
Was this attached to a particular synagogue or was it Orthodox Anarcho-Weats?

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.560
No, no.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.560
Anybody.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.560
Anybody, yeah.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.560
It's an international organisation.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.560
It's been going for a very long time.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.560
Was it mainly raising money or was it social or both?

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.560
Both.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.560
Both, yeah.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.560
We used to have weekly weeding and weekly meetings and then we used to have these charity

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.560
shops which was something quite new in those days.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.560
Now they're everywhere.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.560
So did you have a charity shop in Cardiff?

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.560
No, no, no.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.560
This was just a couple of times a year we'd have one.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.560
And that would be where?

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.560
At the synagogue or?

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.560
No, no.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.560
It would be wherever we could find premises.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.560
Okay, yeah.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.560
So you were just finding an empty shop and use it for a couple of days?

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.560
Yeah.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.560
Yeah, some rather grotty shops.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.560
We had to clean them up first.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.560
Can you remember where any of them were?

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.560
Clifton Street.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.560
Yeah.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.560
City Road.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.560
Wellfield Road.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.560
Wherever we, as I say, we could find.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.560
And that would be what, once a year?

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.560
Initially, yes.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.560
And then after?

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.560
More often or less often?

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.560
And then we used to have a big bazaar once a year.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.560
And where would the bazaar be?

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.560
Again, wherever we could get premises.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.560
Usually church halls.
