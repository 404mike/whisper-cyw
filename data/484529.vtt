00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:47.960
Graham Hogg. So... Graham Hogg is a Scots. So Hoggy, how did you first get into Carnival?

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:57.740
Carnival? Well... How did I first get into Carnival? Well I suppose I was... I got into... I'm a stilt

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.320
walker and most of my contact with Cardiff Carnival has been as a stilt performer,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:17.340
dancer, whatever. And I went to Bristol to study circus in the late 80s and I...

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.180
in the 80s there's like a big kind of like weird alternative circus scene sort of

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.380
kicking off. A lot of connections with travellers and things like travellers were

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.560
painting their buses and becoming circuses and in that era full-time was

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.460
non-accredited so it was much more independent, running their own courses,

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.600
their own kind of tutors and their own style of doing things and really good

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.620
mix. It was really good scene. It was in St Paul's and when I went there I know I

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.820
studied a bit of everything, bit of clowning and mass work, juggling and all these things

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.540
and no one was doing stilts at all. Literally the stilts were the wooden stilts

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.340
you held on there in the cupboard. No one was interested in them whatsoever and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.500
I've been doing... I've done some stilts actually previous to that when I lived in

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.500
Wales actually. I lived in Mid Wales and lived in in Hengindob Wells and there was a

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.960
street theatre group there called What the Dickens, called Chris Orenzella.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.520
They still have a Dickens festival every year.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.240
Well the Victorian festival, I lived in Hengindob Wells and that festival would

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.840
happen. I saw it like you know probably five years and I was just a you know a

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.920
bit of a dropout, a bit of a dope smoking dreadlocks. I didn't really have much

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.440
interest in performance and enjoying What the Dickens, learned stilts and

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.600
then developed this kind of you know appetite for street

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.920
performance and saw a lot of performers at that festival, actually good staff, people like

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.720
Dave Sullivan and that who was really good still walk and classic old-school

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.160
kind of proper street busker. Very limited skills, very basic

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.120
show but he had the whole way of getting a big crowd around and you know

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.040
generating a sort of pattern for the crowd which is a kind of formula with what

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.320
street stuff follows really and has followed since. So anyway, so Kenzie

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.200
Bristol, loads of circus going off, everyone wanting to do trapeze, everyone

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.760
juggling but no one was doing stilts and so I was kind of interested in stilts and

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.640
then I bumped into this other guy Kevin who people said to me, oh Kev's into stilts, you know she

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.520
woke up with him. So we sort of met, talked and stuff. This is Kevin Dennis.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:23.280
So this is Kevin Dennis, yeah from Hoggy and Kev. Kevin Hoggy, usually Kevin Hoggy isn't it.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.320
So yeah, so then I remember Kev saying oh there's this performance in the

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.680
centre of town that's they call it Stilt Walkers, they're interested in doing it

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.880
and I said yeah, yeah okay let's go. So we went to the Onfini on the quayside there in the centre of town

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.560
and it was an artist called Keith Kahn who was designing this big sort of carnival

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.520
performance thing, flying costumes, flying costumes flying to him,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.000
something that I can't remember. You probably remember more about it. You say you were there.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.680
No I saw it, it was a huge outdoor, multimedia outdoor celebration in the Lois Antitheter with an audience of about

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.360
4-5,000 people. Yeah, I remember the two, they're two like king cranes to hold the sort of these flying things

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.640
yeah which were hanging on either side. So me and Kev, so no one else came, just me and Kev

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:21.040
at this kind of audition. Keith was there and I think he was a stilt walker I think. It danced up on stilts

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.120
and he had these kind of black, tall thin black costumes. It was like essentially a skirt, a long skirt

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.440
from your waist down to the bottom of the stilts and then a burka over the top. So it was a burka, no arms

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:37.080
or anything, no sleeves. And we devised this sort of step, this kind of slow motion rocking step in the

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.160
in the Arnolfini Theatre that he liked. He said okay I want you two to wear these black costumes and come on

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.400
from stage right so it's the audience's left at a certain point during the show. What did you represent?

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.760
I don't know, I guess they were female characters, burkas. But I remember a lot of people

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.560
really remembered that moment, a lot of people that it really impacted with them mostly when

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.400
everything goes quiet and then these two figures kind of come rocking on and go across stage.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.000
Years and years later we looked through the Arnolfini's archive and there was a photo

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.840
documentation of it and stuff in their archive and things you know, tracked it down. I didn't get any

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.400
copies of stuff but um so that was the first time I'd done stuff. I'd sort of seen suddenly how

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:27.560
stilts could potentially had for kind of outdoor visual impact you know because you're high up

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.520
and everyone can see you and then all those things. So I kind of got a sense of it. So I

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.200
remember going back to the Arnolfini bar with Kevin and showing him all these drawings and

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.760
sketches that I'd made of kind of stilt ideas, stilt costumes. The weird thing was I was thinking

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.600
about the other day is looking back on them they were all pretty cheesy actually, all like really

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.600
quite daft, things like people on top of toad stools and things like fake legs and things.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.920
Pretty awful most of them actually and in a way they were kind of like a premonition of like the

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.960
walkabout industry really that sort of that fired off like 10 years later.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.520
Yeah I mean I watched some of these they just they're kind of cheesy costumes. Me and Kev,

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:12.200
so we started our working relationship there and then Kev disappeared to France and work in

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.240
Malibu and he came back and we did a St Paul's. He came back and we'd started doing stuff with

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.200
Bristol School of Samba as stilt dancers, me and Kev.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.520
No we weren't because we did a St Paul's carnival in Bristol

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.240
and we went to the mass camp which is like in the Albany Centre at the time.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.160
Alan May was around.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.600
Garfield was the other guy that was in St Paul's then.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.840
Samo, Samba wasn't playing.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.840
No, but Bristol were then one of the sort of top Samba groups.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.640
There was only a few then.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.000
Didn't they perform on the back of a lorry because they do that in St Paul's, it drives me nuts.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.520
There were, yeah St Paul's did have lorries. Now it's all gone sort of like you know electric

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.480
carts and things it's kind of like portable sound system and stuff and but then it was a lot of

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:07.080
lorries and sound systems and lorries and things yeah. So we did this, so we remember we had quite

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.000
a few kids from sub-school and we sort of you know we made some stilts we taught them and we

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.040
had to design kind of you know eight costumes and that's when I came out with this kind of

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:21.800
headdress thing on the beak. So it's four bits of rattan cane bent over to a beak sort of taped

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:28.120
together. Other bits of put inside like a wire framework and then you just basically colour the

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:34.520
sticks so you don't make any sides or you don't make it solid. It's just you know ribbon colours

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:39.400
the sticks tassels at the back some eyes and then it sits on top of your head and it and the way

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:46.360
it's designed was it was going to rat a square hole that you put your round head in. So for years

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.000
after designing that headdress that would give me like chronic every time I played the zombie

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.200
zombie character it would give me like sort of chronic headache because of this awkward fit.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.360
So we went through like a long you know quite a few years of doing it as a kind of a ritual it

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.720
would be like it was a pain thresh we had to go through you had to get the headache you had to

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:09.240
kind of go beyond it you had to kind of trance trance out into the so that was with the jumbies

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.400
the jumbies were of course the jumbie of course is a moco jumbie so moco jumbie is the

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:21.800
rresti indian trinidadian or rresti indian kind of striped man character on stilts moco jumbie.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.000
So we whilst we're developing these headdresses you know they're kind of like they became bird

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.080
characters and they're very portable costumes so you could have them take the headdress off

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.960
stuff it with a bit of ripstop tassels on your feet that go in your bag the wings with like

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.040
bamboo sticks with you know feathers underneath roll up going stilts. I remember you used to come

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:43.160
over on the train and have a meeting. Yeah we neither me nor Kev ever drove so we we just went

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:48.840
everywhere and bus yeah so that was our style was to have like very minimal costumes or things that

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.000
we could build and we went to places so we could design stuff out of cardboard or other types of

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
materials and stuff you know so that so we did st paul's which was okay I was still very green

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.400
then and and kev had done malabar and stuff so he knew how to really come up with that.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:08.040
Well malabar he went off so malabar i think was one of the big big outdoor french street

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:15.160
street companies you know based in um the southern town you know the southern um

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:22.360
what's it called Montpellier yeah Montpellier in Montpellier um and they you know they you know

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.880
they did things that like huge big they're big fire and water fire and ice show thing involved

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:33.160
like these two massive big processions that have started independently of each other so the reds

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.360
and the blacks all start off in some square somewhere the big crowd gathers and then they

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:42.360
they start parading but then in a different part of town there's this big white encampment with all

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.040
the white characters and stuff you know and they kind of do like a little parade around a square

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.480
and then the reds invade and then with the ship and this is huge you know I know it's all photos

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.600
yeah huge amount of pyrotechnics all all strapped onto their stilts and things you know

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.960
let them off as they go around firecrackers let off germs on their stilts you know throw

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.840
fireworks at each other and stuff you know it was crazy so when he came back from that all kind of

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.960
fired up and had a lot of ideas about what he wanted to do you know so i was still quite agreeing

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:14.600
when we did the first st paul's carnival um but then so we did that and then sam bristol sam said

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:20.600
oh we've done this kind this carnival in cardiff so you should come up for that so that's when we

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:29.000
that was the columbus that was 1993 yeah that was the first time we were involved in in cardiff

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.040
when we were yeah we were the sort of wings yeah so it's sort of you know quite brightly coloured

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:38.520
yeah quite brightly coloured but we had that thing as well where we weren't really you know

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.440
we were kind of we just came with bristol so we were sort of we realized it was sort of crashing

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.720
the party a little bit you know we weren't sure whether you know there was a permission thing and

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:51.000
whether we could where we could go and not go and stuff um and so yeah we just did the thing where

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.520
you run a crowd you can go to the front and run at crowds and really sort of stir things up

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.520
on the street and have that kind of freedom of movement leading craze and sort of being

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:03.080
pathfinders and yeah so yeah pioneers they're out there front sort of you know john the baptist

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:09.000
yeah here comes the parade yeah and good at clearing crowds and we've done you know we've done

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.240
by that time we were both quite confident i suppose already you know we've done glass

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:17.320
for me a few times and we felt you know sort of quite accomplished in our in our ability because

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:22.120
like i said about you know the circus scene no one was doing them you see no one was doing stilts at

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:26.200
all they just weren't interested in them it didn't and our thing about stilts was that we didn't

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.880
see them as a circus skill like that was street performance yeah they we were both aware after

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:36.920
we looked into quite quickly that they were not they just didn't fit really in the world of circus

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.960
you did have the guys with stripy trousers you know you did have circus families

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.840
who would all walk in sort of 10 foot stills ever but for us it was like well actually these

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:49.560
are these are something else completely different these these belong in some other context yeah um

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.840
so once we could did a couple of carnivals we thought you know actually carnival is really

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:57.160
an interesting context for them to be and you know yeah because you've got like the visual impact of

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:03.880
the the costumes and things and the whole form of the parade and as a giant big piece of theatre

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.520
you know so that appealed to us much more still walking traditions in carnivals throughout the

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:14.120
world yeah that's where they appear yeah yeah um so yeah we became interested in that and we for

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:18.120
us it was a perfect kind of platform for sort of devising our ideas and developing our

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:25.640
our approach to all the stuff we did on on stills you know i mean in a way like you know the card

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:31.000
the card if the carnivals are probably the the only paid gigs we ever did we kept working together

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:38.440
the rest of the time we you know we would literally make up a costume for an event or

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.960
person would do it once and that was it we you know and this is before the whole walkabout

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.600
industry really kicked off and so we felt like we were kind of like quite we were not any you know

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.800
we were kind of pathfinders in another sense then as well kind of going right ahead a lot of ideas

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.720
were taken and used by other people later on who took you know massive commercial like the high

00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.440
wise high wise rubber all those guys that was a direct copy i think of an early thing that me and

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:06.520
kev did this kind of thing or gactic where we we use rats rat and cane with bin liners over the

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:12.200
top and if you heat if you heat bin liners um plastic bin liners with um you know like a

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.960
heat gun and it shrinks and becomes like a skin you can get it really tight over forms and stuff

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:22.840
and it's super light so we'd you know literally we could travel around and just make things out of

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.600
wire frames and then use bin line and then create these big wings and weird horns and things like

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.720
that you know we did like that when we traveled around and body paints as well i remember you

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.800
guys were very much into body paint yeah i mean yeah yeah body paint yeah i always hated body paint

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:39.080
actually weirdly enough and funny because kev kev was born in africa actually he's born in kenyon

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:44.520
and um so his skin he could he had this kind of smooth skin i always remember in dressing rooms

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:49.320
like he could just paint himself with body paint all over really well and then perform come back

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.760
and just wash it all off like i've never been there but i was my skin's like sort of like a

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:58.920
white pasty sponge when i put when i put it on it's not stained me you know i was really jealous

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.760
of his if he's like skin that you could just take body paint but but yeah it's that thing of just

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:07.960
like it being a simple costume you know because we never wanted to hide the stilts you know they

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:12.200
threw up the mat the guy that striped your trousers he hides his stilts he pretends he's

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.760
pretends he's a tall man with his little boots we hated that for us it was always like just don't

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:22.200
show the stilts show that you are personal stills isn't you know people know that so just go with

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.840
that for stores there's a four-legged anima i think he'd seen that i think he'd seen that at

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.680
malabar i think at malabar there was a giant butterfly that was a really heavy costume that

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:36.920
involved sort of legs um so you know you kind of get a crutch a long aluminium tube and stuff and

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:42.600
then you can when do you start putting backpacks onto your well we learned that from you know from

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:47.160
from carnival excellent now we saw those we saw some aluminium backpacks even in st paul's and

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:52.120
then loads when we came here and then yeah you could sort of again it just suddenly adds a new

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:58.440
dimension to adding yeah adding more height yeah and wings and things we did um come in the year

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:02.840
is the knotting hill we do we're trying to find out what it is but we did we got bristol were doing

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.720
the samba with this big group academic costume madriere um and they said do you want to come

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:12.360
through some um costumes designs and costumes for that and we said what you got in mind they

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:17.080
said well they just kind of want something like vultures or something so we we um design these

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:21.000
costumes that i was you know or even to this day i've always been the things i've most been happy

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.800
with in terms of my actual my own costume my own actual design for this costume we had a ratan

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:31.000
headdress it's like the jumbies but they they sat on top on your head so it's like a vulture's beak

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.280
and then a big white ruff around the neck again just black black clothes but then with a backpack

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.880
that elevated the wings up only about a foot just above your head height because vultures have got

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:44.360
a thing where their heads are lower than their wings so if you look at pictures it's like um

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:49.800
back to backpack with with the wings attached up here and then the wings are sticks of bamboo

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:55.400
going out either side with sticks coming down that you then hold the wings up and i found like a

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:03.560
drawing of a condor eagle and then enlarged it up so scaled it up till it was like sort of 15

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:08.600
feet wide on and then drew it out on a single sheet of muslin wow so painted the feathers in

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:13.960
like pva with gaps in between painted it all black so it was like this exact bird frame that

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:18.600
just then was attached to the the thing and you could if you had the sticks up and you can move

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:23.160
it it was like incredibly mobile and if you let go of it just draped down the back so for stilt

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.480
walk it was just a dream would these be duro stilts or would these now they were always peg stilts

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.640
yeah we never we never worked in duro stilts duro stilts went out then in those early days

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:36.120
but when they did come out and then with the walkabout boom started and and people started

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:42.200
to kind of exploit the ability to stand still that was kind of yeah it's kind of game over for us

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:47.800
we never I mean I have worked on them recently constant motion really you seem to be yeah yeah

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.560
constant constant motion you're balancing you can use you can work much faster you can do

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:56.120
certain you know it's much greater range of moves and stuff yeah you can really run

00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:00.680
I remember moves where you're using one leg and another leg yeah yeah you can hop on legs and

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:05.480
and hopping yes lots of one legs yeah bending forwards and holding it and

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:09.160
dual stilts by contrast it's literally just like standing on it it's like standing on a mini you

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:15.080
know kind of step that finding a super high wall to get stilted up or a van you're off another

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:19.400
roof of a van yeah with high enough stilts you did like a van or garage roof yeah usually like a bin

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:24.760
like a big great big wheelie bin with quite a good height you asked me the other day about high stilts

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:29.560
you didn't really do much on high stilts 10 foot or two meters I think the highest we ever went up

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:34.360
to you know it's like walking in mud you know steps are much slower you know and it's quite scary

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:40.040
actually are quite scary so after 93 I think you take the sex through your other you know

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:44.920
carded carnival history well I mean when we when I think we I think we made a big impression on you

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:49.080
when we did the columbus thing because I remember I fell in love with the John B's I'm the first to admit

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.640
it was really good to get that kind of reception and something we understood the

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:58.200
the whole street parade thing and um so I in my memory I remember that we kind of became we became

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.360
involved every year there for quite a few years yeah but it's been quite hard to sort of pin down

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:07.160
the dates I think the year after it I think I did but I definitely did um definitely did freedom

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:15.160
blues altogether um what costumes were playing and then well uh freedom blues that was when we

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:19.800
used cardboard and we sort of built a whole all the people that were going to be on stilts so I

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:24.120
guess we came up and and people signed up to do stills and then we did workshops and train you

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:29.240
know taught people and train them and yeah and had a capacity of um you know whatever half a dozen

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:33.240
to a dozen sort of still walkers and Reese would have been around at that time yeah Reese and Cora

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:39.240
is in that pictures as well Kevin's daughter yeah um Reese was really you know he was very young at

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:43.240
that time wasn't he yeah and he was super able he got up and he was running around you know he's

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:48.600
model student in a lot of ways and you were like beatboxers in cardboard yeah we sort of

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:53.880
and yeah I think we're sort of pastiche in youth culture we were trying to get Mickey out yeah

00:18:53.880 --> 00:19:00.760
that's right it was big big big records that we threw out yeah yeah I mean I sort of love

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:05.400
cannabis leaf sort of things and all hats and yeah things you know things like we sort of said shitty

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:11.720
sort of like stussy and this sort of stuff stussy but sort of shitty cardboard and uh kind of like

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:16.120
logos and graphics so yeah it's kind of maybe like sort of pastiche of sort of I think we got

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.840
we got a picture on one of the local papers here I think in front of the big museum in between the

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.840
columns and it said something like you know sort of self-mockery that youth culture sort of self

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:29.480
mocking itself you know so someone kind of got it in a nice friendly sort of way yeah yeah yeah

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.760
um that was really good fun it was very cartoonish I thought yeah because you know again it's that

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.680
thing about particularly for certain material just using like sheet cardboard yeah making

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:43.720
shorts and sort of solid costumes out of cardboard so a lightweight they're kind of you know disposable

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:52.600
you know

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.880
yeah so cardboard you know against that thing about having a simple

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:04.280
medium you're working with you know carbon what can you do with it you know

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:08.200
you may make some sort of pumps some big white pumps out of cardboard and

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:14.680
um so that was then so that was yeah that was freedom freedom blues and then also gaden

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:23.240
um and then we're doing a group as well where there was kids young kids who wanted different kind of car

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:29.080
related bits and bobs and costumes one one kid had like you wanted to be like sort of burst tire so

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:36.040
he's in this kind of costume which is a tire all in shreds and stuff and quite young kiddy and another

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.560
guy had like a sort of coffin on his back it was like a speaker so it was like a coffin that was

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:45.960
on a backpack made out of like sheet um that printing aluminium sheet material would david

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:52.760
be in that one did he come across him was he was he the guy that was in the sammer band

00:20:52.760 --> 00:21:00.600
yes that's right yeah he was around then he's one of the faces that I remember I remember him liking

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.280
him getting his own stilts and then being in the sound you know just being in the sammer group but

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:09.880
on stilts you know sort of taken to them so he was around then um so that was all together yeah

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:14.200
I remember I remember like having to spend so much time getting out of the people's costumes

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.840
ready for that one and I didn't know what I was going to do and then I actually in the end just

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:23.720
had like black and white stripes with four legs and my face was sort of like a crossings like a

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:29.400
zebra crossing but my I remember my my sort of my my like or black trousers sort of split

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:35.800
right by my balls so the whole that parade my balls just kind of hanging out

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:43.240
of this costume yeah hopefully no one spotted them it was never part of the design you know

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.520
um so yeah so when I yeah so when we've looked at um images and stuff and it looks like I was

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:54.520
I was here for a few but um I guess it was such a big sort of time in my life I remember it being

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:59.240
much more I think Kevin Kevin carried on after me much more you know yes but so I only thought I

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:05.160
did a few I think I came filmed but you carried on a long tradition of a long journey in carnival

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:13.080
and and elsewhere was your next step after Cardiff Trinidad and Peter Minchel the guru of the mass

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:18.520
the masquerade yeah because I think we went I think to Trinidad 96 I think that was the year

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:23.400
we went so you could probably cross reference it for finding out what what year he did read um

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:31.880
but yeah we we got some money from I think Arts Council something those awards for all type things

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:36.360
sort of still at workshops and all these things we're trying to do in Bristol which you know we

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:40.200
didn't get together and we had a bit of money at the end of it a few thousand and I said to Kev

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:44.600
come let's just go you know let's we've got contacts there we can get something to crash let's just go

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.360
and and try and be involved in it so and you say it was Maryanne Roberts who made the initial

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:52.280
yeah I think she made the connection see it she might have had a family home in um

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:57.320
port of Spain where we spent we did stay for one or two days and then she she sort of tried to get

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:02.280
us into the the Minchel camp basically in the into the mass camp what was that experience like being

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:08.600
part of yeah yeah it was pretty mind-blowing actually um looking back I mean it was I mean

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.320
I just remember spending the whole time in the shade I just remember never actually being out in

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:20.040
the sun because it was just so hot just too hot um when we got into the mass camp we sort of drive

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.360
out of town it's like this big sort of hangar airplane hangar military thing it was just

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:32.360
saving such a huge scale um they kind of knew we were still walkers but but to get to stay there

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:36.600
in the actual mass camp and just sort of literally crash crash out rough on the floor on the cardboard

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:41.320
and forward a sort of sheet over you get fed there sleep on the shelves sometimes yeah we found a

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:45.080
few places but then they were kind of they belonged to certain people so you'd go out and

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:49.960
sort of sleep on the shelf and then you know after an hour someone would come in tapping

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:55.160
you know to get off got to get off their place and you know so we came lower in the packing order

00:23:55.160 --> 00:24:00.200
there so it rose up through the ranks of costume assembling because the foreman who ran the place

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:04.040
Murph I think he sort of took us he liked us you know we're quite hard workers and

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.440
and actually were quite able so we can't start we ended up doing all these really fancy head

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:13.880
dresses and things and um and then we didn't really ever know what how whether we were going

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.480
to get to be in the parade you know because it's one of the things where we were sort of

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.800
hoping to sort of find a way of being involved in it but but every all the costumes are

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:25.800
prescriptive they're all designed and made and the people buy them you know and there might be

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:30.200
hundreds and hundreds of them but they're still designed and they're very particular as you know

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.880
it's like a very particular theme and that that year the theme was red and all the same red

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.640
and all these costumes at year were these kind of like characters of handbags and

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.480
royal sort of looking costumes and things you know gentlemen women and

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:47.560
nothing big at all no backpacks nothing like that just all really quite simple kind of ball almost

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:55.080
um sort of costumes and then sort of the day before we someone said oh um yeah Peter's he's

00:24:55.080 --> 00:25:00.120
going to let you lead he's going to let you lead the parade and this is Peter Mitchell this is a

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:08.040
guru man who's well open to olympic games effectively yeah yeah so you're going to

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:13.960
lead Peter Mitchell's 1960 1996 that's extraordinary yeah and what were the costumes

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:18.920
how did the costumes arrive and then because so yeah i think we'd i think we must have got up on

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:24.920
stilts during the the time we were there just to sort of show our skills off now we because they

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.960
had while we were there another little tangent actually is that there was a stilt group there

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:36.440
in in port of spain dragon's yard guy called dragon quite famous yeah yeah yeah and so marion

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:41.080
took us down to meet them and that was a big thing as well that was a big thing was dragons still

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:46.120
going i haven't heard about it i think i don't know i think kev's more you know kept in contact

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:49.480
with people they kept his eye on people they might have even come to europe at some point definitely

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:55.080
they've been to liverpool yeah so we went down to that yard met him and and we sort of turned up

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.280
you know these kind of white boys with their kind of metal stilts you know all the kids were laughing

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.760
at us and that was amazing seeing them and they were these tiny little kids you know as high as

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:08.280
my kind of shoulders on on 10 foot stilts and doing some amazing moves and things it was quite

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.960
and there's that's that german photographer was out there at that time stephan and i have just written

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:16.840
it down moko juby's book we used to have a book here we were we were there when he was there and

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:21.160
he asked us i mean kev relishes this story more than me but there was this one shot when all the

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:25.400
kids are taking a rest yeah and they're all sitting on this huge wall of this i know the

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:29.800
photograph of which you speak and he asked us to not we were sitting down at the end and he asked

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:34.120
us to get out of the photo he asked us to step out of the way

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.800
so yeah we said it was nice to have that other little connection there what was the experience

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.560
on the day like i mean so coming back to the day so then they said oh yeah these costumes arrived

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.960
and they were literally just trousers long trousers and a long sleeve top with a little

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:56.200
red hat and that was kind of it you know that was it but but at the same time i think you know

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:01.240
that's sometimes that's it isn't it you do less you do more with less you know you just have

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:06.680
something simple you know they're like jester sort of type thing so so yeah i mean um we sort

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:12.200
of assembled on the day of about 11 o'clock and and like i said to the other day you know we did it

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.960
we did it all wrong we sort of stayed up and still it's a whole day and tried to give it sort of

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.520
maximum energy all day which is a 12 hour day

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:25.560
so if i ever went back i still feel like i need to have one more go at it because you know

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.240
because i can still actually get up and stuff now and bust pretty good moves i think

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:34.760
if i knew i could get up and down all throughout the course of the day and have like you know like a

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:39.400
three or four meals with rests in between and stuff then yeah come on bring it on but that's

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:43.160
what people were doing so they were breaking up they were assembling for the judging points

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:49.560
parading marching past and then just assembling throughout yeah but that that thing of like

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:55.000
stopping resting eating and then reassembling for the next leg and then stopping eating socialising

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.360
reassembling that was that's how it works yeah how else can you can you span it over 12 hours

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:05.880
so we were just up the whole time it ends in the big stadium so again like i said to the other day

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.400
we got down just before the big stadiums you got down to for the last leg and i was

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:14.360
i could just could hardly walk on the ground let alone get back up and still so i remember being

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:19.240
absolutely exhausted beyond anything i'd experienced before you know with the heat

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:24.280
and the whole the whole thing and you know all our moves been done the first hour and a half of the

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:28.520
parade so now it's like 10 hours in you imagine just couldn't be couldn't even hop and i remember

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:33.400
just being down resting by the side by the street by this fan shade and then peter mitchell sort of

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:38.360
turned up um and he just stopped and said oh yeah you guys have been going all day you know

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:43.000
and so there he was you know and we were too tired to even talk you know just glad that

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.880
we're kind of there yeah kind of a god yeah sort of just coming at that moment and then we got up

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:53.640
yeah we got up and thing he had that year was he had three big giant letters he had red made in

00:28:53.640 --> 00:29:00.040
these big sort of you know eight foot high big plywood um forms that were painted red and stuff

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:05.000
so they got bought on stage at that point sort of laid out yeah that's the stage um and yeah i mean

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.840
you know got up and then literally i hobbled across that stage you know literally

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:14.840
yeah my biggest missed opportunity in my life my moment could have been there to

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.840
have been the other way around it would be in the beginning could have gone on that stage and kind

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:24.840
of gone you know come on you know literally just could not just managed to get the other side of it

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:33.240
so bad um so that was trinidad yeah that was that was but i mean you know it seems to me you still

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:39.160
have the same inquiring mind the same interest in things carnival and way beyond um tell us about

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:47.800
your connection with haiti uh originally through which as well i'll let you tell the story via the

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:53.560
cube start there and then perhaps take us take us to jacama yeah jack now let's start with the the

00:29:53.560 --> 00:30:00.040
earth jack well i suppose actually after trinidad i suppose 96 because i think that's when i stopped

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:07.800
because the cube was started in 98 yeah completely independent volunteer run

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:15.000
sort of um cinema music venue art space pistol um so you was born in 96 as well i think 96

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:23.560
was when we did st donats isn't it that was in 95 96 yes so this is swicker doing the uh end of

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:28.200
the beyond the border storytelling festival yeah sort of an outdoor show what do you call about

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:32.840
that what was your role in that what do you mean that was great i remember i mean kept on site for

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:38.760
yeah a little sign up on the top there crazy crazy guys um had some pretty crazy times they've just

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:43.880
like one giant party basically one giant kind of hot spoons as they used to do you remember the

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:48.760
hot spoons burning yeah you get down your knees and then sort of like a big big dessert spoon of

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:55.480
brandy and sort of flick it down your your kind of mouth a lot of that they were serious party

00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:00.040
heads but they also kind of had a you know it's meg and um morag and ali and they they had a plan

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:06.600
they knew what they were doing in a kind of chaotic crazy way very libertarian yeah yeah very and and

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:10.280
you know that was a show that they were assembling so we made kev with the kind of i think i was

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:15.240
meant to be balor there's a retelling of one of the myths isn't it an irish myth battle of the evil

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:20.440
eye uh it's luke with the shining arms and luke that's right kev was luke the guy that gets reborn

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:25.400
and i was sort of baddy and louis and balor was interesting because it's almost like a premonition

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:30.280
of um or sort of nuclear power isn't it and balor has a secret weapon that you that that you have

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:34.120
to have seven eyelids open and when it's fully open you can't i mean it's like it's like nuclear

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:39.640
non-nuclear you know isn't it it's like a combination of it yeah crazy thing so i remember having a really

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:46.120
good costume that ali and tom did for balor yeah i think it was i mean yeah it's had all that kind

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:50.520
of imagery in it and it was that great sight wasn't it that long strip with the sort of palm

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:56.360
trees at the bottom jousting field down the bottom of saint donna's castle yeah it's good yeah it was

00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:00.920
there's a swimming pool there i remember having a day and we went swimming and there's a sort of

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:05.080
college there isn't it atlantic college is it that's right yeah it's the baccalaureate yeah it was

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:08.760
just a great i remember sort of driving the van the swicker van around there doing donuts in the field

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:16.840
yeah and it's pretty crazy pretty crazy event performance but but um so that if that was 96

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:22.680
so you had two children back in those years one was born in 96 one was born in the same year as

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:28.360
the cube so i must have pretty much pulled out of still some performance stuff and put all my energy

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:32.920
into the cube cinema so i can't i co-founded it with kev actually and two other people

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:40.520
um and so you're a co-founder of the cube yeah yeah yeah me and kevin are co-founders of it so

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:45.000
i'm the only remaining yeah co-founder of it yeah it was our was our project how long has that been

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:52.680
going on since 98 yeah like 15 years 15 years it's pretty great and um actually weirdly enough we

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:59.720
me and kev did you remember those cameras we did yeah yeah for poncepool market centenary yeah

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:05.240
yeah you were two giant cameras we designed those for abariss with film festival that's right so we

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.680
actually designed these costumes and sent them off you know it's getting it was one of those ways of

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.760
trying to get work in those days we sort of thought what what need what who wants a giant

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:17.720
walks that walking camera a film festival so we sort of and all the film passes we sent

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:24.440
sent the imagery to only two ever got back london film festival we opened in empire in the empire

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:29.320
unless a square one year these giant still cameras which is a crazy story but then and then

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:33.320
abariss with film festival welsh international film festival said will you prepare to come up

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:39.720
for 10 days and um and work so we did that and and each after we finished doing our appearances

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:44.120
in the evening at the in the in the club that was the headquarters whatever all this office

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:47.720
there was this really good vibe of people hanging around and nothing to do and we thought wouldn't

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:51.000
it be good to have like a club where you could sort of hang around and show films and stuff and

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.320
that's where we got this idea of like a cinema as social wow in abariss with and then yeah and

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:59.720
we came back to bristol and then we we had a sort of loft space that we did these kind of legal

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:05.240
screenings and stuff in club rhombus but we did that for about a year and then then this this venue

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:09.880
closed down that we that was a cinema and we thought let's try and take it on in my own sort

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:15.160
of cinema thing i said it was a 98 so so the long story around from there is that we so i stopped

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:20.520
kev carried on but i can pretty much stop doing any carnival um even st paul's and stuff and

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:24.200
i kept us still get up almost religiously every year at st paul's and stuff i've always thought

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:29.560
was amazing you know but i just couldn't i just changed my whole area of you know work in a way

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:35.640
you know and didn't do it for years and years and years until um the earthquake in struck haiti and

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:38.920
and a group of people at the cube thought that we should be good idea to try and take out like a

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:45.560
mobile cinema which consisted of a video projector and dvds and a screen and and they just show films

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.400
for the camps where people have been the home people in the camps and people are homeless

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:55.720
um and and a lot of children are family-less you know orphans and stuff yeah horrendous kind

00:34:55.720 --> 00:35:02.120
of circumstances and um so what work with the audience so i was in the third we sent

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:06.360
earthquake survivors what do they watch we sent we sent three groups the first year they went was

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:10.280
very shortly after the earthquake and that was quite hard um and then there's another group and

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.880
then i was in the third group by the time we went they'd established what worked really well with

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:18.840
the audience and stuff but it was things like the red balloon um this kind of new guinea film

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:24.760
ballon d'or um kirk who saw stress kind of films and stuff you know so and they'd watch the same

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:29.160
film over and over again you know and always laugh at the same points and and and stuff and

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:34.840
but um but it so happened that when we went it was carnival season you see and i knew that we

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:41.320
were going to be there in carnival season and um i'd heard a little bit about this kind of famous

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:47.160
carnival in jackmail which is in the south south of the the port of prince which is struck by

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:51.480
that area got hit by the carnival the most it's on like a beginning of a peninsula and on the

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:56.520
northern part of that is port of prince and leogan where we were based for the first few weeks and

00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:03.560
then on the southern part of that peninsula there's um a place called jackmail and um and

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:09.400
this has got quite a famous carnival quite a famous um sort of really raw almost african

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:17.560
you know very non-commercialized um no toys i mean carnival and so the carnival when we were there

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:22.040
that was the like the year before the carnival had been cancelled throughout the whole of haiti

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:25.400
because of the earthquake that's how bad the earthquake was the cancel the carnival had been

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:30.120
cancelled which is like cancelling christmas here you know cancelling every calendar and you know all

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:35.000
in one can you imagine so so when the carnival was on this was the first time it had been back on

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.600
again so they were coming back with a really big a big party you know um so so i knew that

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:44.440
we were going to be there for the carnival so it kind of reignited that interest in

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:50.920
in it i suppose didn't know what to expect um but it was a pretty immense kind of folk

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:57.800
occasion really um just such massive sort of participation and in it from people you know

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:06.200
you know um there was also some um traditional um characters i mean you mentioned the black

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:12.280
jude the man with the mysterious box and the devils take us through those yeah um so i mean

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:16.680
they so there was a route they parade they do follow a route and when we they had the carnival

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:21.400
we went down to this area we had this guy called michelle who who was who showed us around and he

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:25.400
was really good he was like kind of fixer in a way and translator and stuff and we took us down

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:30.200
this big camp bit and there were all these paper mache style kind of costumes and things you know

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:34.440
so that we that we just didn't know what form it would take didn't know how would they be parading

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:37.640
with big backpacks was it you know kind of traditional characters didn't really know much

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:42.120
about it so when we when i first saw that i thought okay right i thought okay that's they

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:46.360
do that here the tradition of these kind of big big heads and these kind of sculptures almost

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:51.960
people just carry you know and really intricately made and painted you know really um very kind of

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:55.800
literal in the sense you know not not gestural that really solid kind of characters and

00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:01.080
and each one illustrates a bit from some folk story or some voodoo god or godess or something

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:06.920
um and then so they have that and they all get paraded and then there's kids versions of it

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:11.240
and stuff and but then they have these these devils which which people walk around and which are

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:16.840
which are effectively that style of making but just the head it's like a big horned you know

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:23.160
um devil headdress but then the rest of the the rest of the costume might be just boots

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:28.760
you know tasselie tunic trousers but then these wings that they have which are kind of wings that

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:33.640
want to kind of a backpack but they're like big flaps of wood so they they can slap them they can

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:38.840
snap them behind like a bit like the crocodile in a way in punch and judy's kind of thing that snaps

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:44.280
they kind of clacker and they they kind of go along and clack them and um and then they parade

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.560
they kind of parade in single file so they do this thing where they kind of all follow each other

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:52.680
around you know um but i mean you know i can't even begin to i mean there's just so many there's

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.640
this kind of free agent characters around around there's just another group which they all like

00:38:55.640 --> 00:39:00.200
this they were based on a general some famous historic general who is either a good guy or a

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:04.840
bad guy i'm not quite sure what he what he did and um they have all these kind of big lips and they

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:09.800
and you know these kind of military tops medals and stuff and then they just do these dances and

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:14.680
there's big groups of guys who are all doing that one character again moving in single file

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:21.480
but just doing these very particular dances and things you know um so it's just so much going on

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:25.400
it was just hard to kind of keep you know keep keep keep on top of it all and um and then ones

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:30.040
i'll describe yesterday thing with a sort of like a single uh a line of guys all next standing next

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:35.160
to each other walking along sort of barefoot but just kind of paint painted white with these placards

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:38.920
around but just moving really like ghosts just really silently so down the street what do they say

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:43.320
on the placard i'm an ex i think she's got freedom liberty you know because of course haiti's got

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:47.560
comment yeah because they have that there's a lot there is a deep awareness there of them having

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:52.600
come from slaves and it was the first black country wasn't it absolutely it's got an incredible

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:58.520
history and um and then the voodoo is another big movement out there as well um you know in the

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:03.080
in the parade you'd get actually some christian groups who are sort of very evangelical women in

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:07.400
white and singing singing they've got christian songs and things across this yeah yeah because

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:11.800
because it's that whole cocktail of religion there yeah cocktail of religion and superstition

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:15.560
so the christians got involved but on their own terms yeah exactly yeah yeah on their own terms

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:20.680
they don't really enter into the but then but then right next to them would be this this crazy

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:25.880
you know voodoo group everyone's just going wild and they're turning these kind of effigies of

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:31.240
things along and they're running around and and uh it's amazing um and voodoo out there is is kind

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:36.440
of like a kind of alternative it's like a kind of a it's like they're i don't know it's kind of

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:41.800
i mean it's a pagan thing but it's it's it's hard again it's hard to sort of describe the kind of

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:46.360
the context of it there because it's much more to do with with tolerance and

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:49.880
everyone being equal and being welcomed so i went to voodoo ceremony and it was like

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:55.640
it was like a kind of a rave meets kind of a you know knees up in a pub it's like a community

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:59.960
sing sing song community get together uh community piss up you know one's drinking

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:09.400
rum and dancing and socializing and and yeah i mean i've got some music i've got some recordings

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:13.240
of the drumming and stuff but yeah i mean yeah literally like again like i said to you

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:19.400
there's a stage of the drummers it's about 20 maybe and um there's one guy that's the

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:23.400
main lead drummer and when they start they just start this kind of very fast tempo and that's it

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:29.160
it just stays at that tempo solidly for like four hours and then they take a break and then

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:33.720
then it starts again same time during that period that the people who are possessed come

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.240
yes the women are kind of parading around singing and then and then priests and

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:42.920
precesses are there so the women are part of the voodoo group that of the temple that you're in

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:51.080
and this one they had white with bits of pink clothes on and then towards the end of the second

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:54.200
session they kind of go into the chances and things yeah so people come into the middle and

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:58.840
circle around and then well more than no one got possessed but um you can see them sort of trying

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:04.680
and then oh no okay and then sort of shuffling off because you know they'd like they'd failed you know

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:13.160
so yeah that was quite amazing the um the jackmill carnival yeah you know again i'd like to go again

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:17.400
actually i think it'd be really nice to now haven't done it once to kind of go again and see

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:22.360
see how it works there's there's um there's a group out there doing like these puppets

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:25.800
the french group that doing these you know ones that go on backpacks and the heads go up really

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:29.480
high and you and then they have the big hands and the sleeves and you sort of walk along with them you know

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:36.760
i'd say one of the joys of this anniversary project is getting to reconnect with people

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:43.400
like yourself who haven't seen for going on for 20 years and what i find is that you know i think

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:48.840
we've already in a during our exhibition at the carlis story uh ogee's going to come along and

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:54.600
we'll make a presentation with uh sound recordings and the rest of it based on his experiences in

00:42:54.600 --> 00:43:01.000
haiti and the jack and the carnival in particular but i think we have sort of decided that we need

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:07.480
to go and visit that and see whether that can't be the basis of some form of collaborative and

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:13.640
intercultural exchange in the future i mean in swicker we haven't done that since 2005

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:21.640
when i went to trinidad last and worked with the blue devils traditional character up on the

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:29.560
mountain behind port of spain uh paramin and then we brought them over and we did all kinds of things

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:34.920
so um i can't say this has been the most fascinating conversation it's been absolutely

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:40.520
wonderful and i would like to end by saying ogee you are a carl hero thank you very much

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:43.640
for all your memories it's a pleasure thank you very much
