00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120
1919, Newtonian riots in the armed forces. This is chapter 6 of our series of short stories.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.720
It's part of a sequence where we're explaining what happened and what was going across the

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:24.400
desk of the British Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, in that 1918-1919 period. 1919

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:33.440
when the race riots occurred. But those issues began in 1918 on the Royal Navy when mutinies

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:42.920
occurred from November 1918 when and the crew of a cruiser in Libau, Lithuania refused to sail.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:52.560
Similarly in the ports of Archangel and Mamansk, Navy crews were mutinying. In January 1919,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.120
the Admiralty warned the British government, the Prime Minister, that sailors were trying to form

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:10.440
a trade union. The Royal Navy ships who were moored around Russia and in Mamansk in 1918 and

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:21.440
1919 refused to sail, partly because they refused to go to war against the Bolsheviks. For the Navy,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:30.280
the war was over. On the 13th of January 1919, the Royal Navy gunboat, the HMS Kill Bride,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:39.360
moored in Milford Haven, experienced a mutiny. The crew refused to obey orders and even took

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:49.400
over the ship and flew the red flag instead of the Royal Navy ensign. January 1919 also saw Royal

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:57.520
Navy mutinies in Inver Gordon, Ross Scythe, Devonport and Portsmouth with crews refusing to

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:06.560
weigh anchor and sail for action. And the 645 ton gunboat, the HMS Sekela, when ordered to sail up

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.840
the river Davina, exposing itself to Bolshevik guns on the banks of the river, they refused to go.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.320
The Admiral Cohen asked the Admiralty if Britain was actually at war with the Bolsheviks,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:26.440
as war had not officially been declared, and was told yes. He then arrested five men from the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.040
mutiny and sentenced to death. This was later commuted to five years in prison. The issues

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.920
were threefold and this was consistent across the armed forces. The men had had enough of war. They

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:50.080
were generally volunteers or conscripts and they wanted to return home. After all, their war had

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:57.880
been against Germany. Russia versus the Bolsheviks, who had taken over predominantly most of Russia

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:07.280
in the 1917 Civil War, the Navy and later the Army felt this was not their war. In fact,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.320
many respected the Bolshevik cause. But the real problem for government came when soldier

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:21.520
mutiny started. At the start of 19 there was a wave of soldier mutinies at Southwick, Folkestone,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:30.600
Dover, Osterley Park, Shortlands, Westrom Hill, Felixstowe, Grove Park, Shoreham, Bristol, Aldershot,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:38.160
Kempton Park, Southampton, Maidstone, Blackpool, Park Royal, Chatham, Fairlop, Biggin Hill,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:45.600
as well as several London railway stations where troops refused to embark trains for Russia and

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:53.640
France. And troops already in Calais and Archangel formed Soviets and made links with local struggles.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:04.080
On the 3rd of January 1919, 12,000 soldiers blocked Folkestone Harbour and 2,000 marched in

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:12.240
Dover to the town hall. They were refusing to be sent back to France or to Russia. The common story

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:21.800
was they wanted to be demobilised. The war they signed up for was over. In London, 1,500 soldiers

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:27.680
marched on 10 Downing Street but unsurprisingly the Prime Minister David Lloyd George was out

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:36.200
when they arrived. In 1919 there were more than 50 soldier mutinies and 100,000 soldiers were

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.640
involved in those mutinies or as some of them called them strikes but in the armed forces.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:50.880
Refusing to work is a mutiny. More than anything they wanted to go home and were tired of army

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.760
discipline. They were conscripts, they were volunteers. This was not a professional army

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:06.200
that we now see as normal. On the 23rd of January, over 5,000 soldiers arrived in Southampton Docks,

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:12.120
got off their ship to discover they were not going home. Instead the rumours started they

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.960
were going to Russia. They formed a soldiers union and mutinied. The army sent General Hugh

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:24.280
Trenchard to bring the situation to an end. This was an uncompromising man, former commander to

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:30.480
the Royal Flying Corps and later to be in charge of London's Metropolitan Police. His task was to

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:37.680
show all army conscripts mutiny would be dealt with in an uncompromising way. The mutiny and

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.160
soldiers wouldn't let him into the docks. He then brought in military police and 250 armed

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.840
soldiers from Portsmouth who were lined up in front of the mutineers with fixed bayonets and

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:58.120
ordered to cock rifles and instructed to fire on command. Trenchard was believed. All but a

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:05.560
hundred mutineers gave in and the hundred who did not were hosed down with ice-cold water from

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:14.560
Southampton Harbour and then arrested. In Calais on the 26th of January the men of the Army Ordnance

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:22.160
and Mechanical Transport Corps refused to obey orders. They joined with French dock workers to

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:28.160
bring the railways and shipping to a halt. Soldiers at Vendreux camp and women of the

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:34.320
nursing corps in Dunkirk marched to Calais to join the now created Soldiers' Council.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:42.000
Five thousand soldiers were waiting for ships to go back to Britain. They joined the strike and

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:51.000
soon the number was 30,000 armed forces members. Generals to Julian Bing were sent to stop the

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.200
mutiny. Unfortunately he arrived before the two divisions of soldiers who were supposed to

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:06.280
accompany him and when he met the soldiers the strikers took his car and replaced the limousine

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:14.160
with an army jeep. When the divisions arrived many were young and inexperienced. They talked to the

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:20.640
strikers and many changed sides. By now Bing had had enough and with the soldiers he had available

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:27.600
he set up machine gun posts around the camp and ordered surrender or death. He arrested four ring

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:33.720
leaders who he wanted to sentence to death but Winston Churchill, Minister of War, could not

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:41.480
remit risk martyrs so they were imprisoned instead. Now as I've said that's over 50 mutinies,

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:48.960
a hundred thousand soldiers, massive disruption and even soldiers marching from Victoria Stafan

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:57.360
station with rifles at the slope ready down Whitehall. Churchill could see hundreds of them

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:05.240
marching past his window and he admitted later in a book that he was afraid. I remained in my room

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:15.120
a prey to anxiety. Yet unlike West Indian soldiers who were to mutiny in Taranto in Italy because

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:21.560
they were denied a wage increase because of their colour, no white soldier was shot for mutiny in

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:35.240
1919. Those soldiers were to return to haunt black people in particular but to haunt Prime Minister

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:43.200
David Lloyd George later once they became ex-servicemen. But the problem for David Lloyd

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:52.580
George was he simply didn't have an army that was under his control and he had promised those

00:08:52.580 --> 00:09:02.360
soldiers in the 1918 general election that he would demobilise them quickly. He was overruled

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:09.400
on that promise by a faction led by Winston Churchill but nonetheless the disillusionment

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.840
of the soldiers began.
