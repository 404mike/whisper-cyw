00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Who thinks you're cut there?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Oh

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Oh

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Oh

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.760
The next time we're going to sing is a song that actually my mother found on a record sung by a lady named Mary Hopkins

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.280
She was honored in Wales and made her a bard

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.760
because of her contribution to Welsh folk music and

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.300
Actually, the record that we found was a record produced by the Beatles who discovered her and put out a number of records on their record

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.600
Label and a couple of them were in Welsh, which was lovely and anyway, so

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.440
Oh

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And when the sun has come, he'll come back.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Right in the right, no other gun.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I'll kill him for the way he done.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I'll get a job in the yard, no higher.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Right in the guy, no more dial.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I'll get a job in the yard, no higher.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:07.360
Make the

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:14.940
fresh
