WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
I don't know if we ever spent time in that. I can't remember spending time in the house and doing things.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:12.480
It was always had doors and it was a brilliant place to be because when we moved there, it was a very different place.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.680
Because it wasn't all kind of first and things like that covering all those hills at that time.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.480
They were kind of curtained around the sides of some of the hills which are there on the top, you know,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.600
Sugarloaf kind of just up behind the village there kind of was bald on the top like my head.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.120
The part, great part behind, the little part, the globe which was directly opposite where our house was.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.920
The forest encryption hadn't started on that. They hadn't started on much of it at all.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:53.120
They were just starting to kind of acquire the land and start the operation of putting the trees in.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.040
It was quite different and we obviously went to the village school.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.680
So I can remember we walked every day kind of, my brothers and sisters, we walked down to the Abbey school,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.960
which is where you're from, talking from today I assume.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.120
Yes it is. We're actually sitting in the junior room.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.320
All right, yes, yeah, yeah, well most of the time it was kind of weird.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.400
It was just two rooms basically at the time there then.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.160
But yeah, it was, there were lots of lots of memories but most of it as I said was outdoors.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.120
We played outdoors. We were, I think my parents just like us out of the house to be honest.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.080
And we were given a lot of freedom. That's the thing that you see so different from today.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.120
Because we used to just, we used to walk all over the place.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.400
Our friends were kind of, Robert who used to live in Coompoyth, which is North Co...

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.400
The Griffiths live in Coompoyth, isn't it?

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.560
And a bit further down, Kevin Pohl.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.940
Yes.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.440
She's up on the right as you're leaving the village and things like that.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.280
And we used to walk down to the village over the saddle as it is between the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.200
globe and the sugarloaf there over the top.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.640
The little track that brings you out by David's old petrol pump.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.360
When you finished the school, the junior school, where did you go to school after that?

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.680
We landed in the drum school. So we were bussed then.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.160
Yeah, the bus collected us every morning when it could.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.800
If we didn't get a week, extra week off every winter because of the snow and the bus couldn't

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.280
get up, we were disappointed because it didn't take them much to stop the buses in those days.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.920
Now I'm sure.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:49.520
But yeah, we went to Llanderind and there were a smallish number that were kind of

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.480
going on the bus, I suppose.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.800
Because at that time you got Grammar and Secondary Mordaing in Llanderind as well.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.760
I don't think the ME could come here, junior school.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.120
It was a brilliantly happy place.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.480
I can never remember unhappy times there, except for when the dentist used to come with his

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:15.120
caravan. He used to park his caravan on the yard as his dental surgery.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.840
And everybody had to have a dental appointment.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.880
From the school?

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.640
It was called the butcher. All the children were scared of it.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.640
He only had to turn up and it was enough for some of them.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.440
But otherwise it was all happy times.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.600
But yeah, that's right.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.240
And again, it was freedom in the school as well.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.280
You know, your yard or your garden now, or that, when it was a school was unfenced

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.400
to those two little streams that could move on one side and until I don't go up the other

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.120
under the bridge.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.040
That was unfenced.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.560
And as kids, there's only one teacher in the school.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.040
She'd be having a cup of tea.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.520
And we, all the rest of us just running around like mad fishing with jam jars in the river.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.760
And things. So, you know, it was a good time. We really enjoyed it.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:14.560
I don't think academically we learned what we needed for preparing us for our secondary school.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.640
Did you catch anything?

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.960
Did you catch anything?

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.400
Oh, minnows. We used to catch them.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:27.120
Minnows and little, what do they call them, little fish.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.240
There would always be jam jars on the windowsill in the school with tadpoles in it and minnows

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.240
that somebody caught and things like that kind of sitting around.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.880
And of course, in those days, it was heated by a big, was it coal or was it wood?

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.360
It was a big kind of dark heater in the room with a chimney going up off it.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.800
And that was the heating.
