Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.040
Interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.640
Interviewees Marion Russell and Katie Griffiths.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.320
The date today is Thursday, Wednesday the 22nd of January 2015.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.400
And the venue for the interview is the Swicker office.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.400
Marion first.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.560
Marion, for the record, would you be kind enough to spell your name in full?

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.560
Certainly, M-A-R-I-O-N-R-U-S-S-E-L-L.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.560
Thank you very much. And Katie, over to you.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.240
K-A-T-I-E-G-R-I-F-F-I-T-H-S.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.240
That's fantastic.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.160
Well, I'm very much looking forward to this interview because between you, you've wrapped up,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.400
it's got to be going on for at least 20 carnivals.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.200
How did it all begin?

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:00.560
Well, I first started working as a youth worker at the Tan in the grounds of Ninnium Park School,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.840
where there was a workshop open to adults and kids from the youth club

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.040
to go along and learn how to play some steel pans.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.720
I went along with some of my youth club kids, no adults turned up.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.320
And as I recall, the guy said,

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.320
why don't you have a go woman and pick up them sticks and play the hell out of them?

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:33.680
And I tried and then ended up in the Swicker All-Star Steel Pan Band.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.800
And I'm actually thinking that you were the traditional woman on the bass that you were playing,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.160
what some would say is the hardest part of a steel pan orchestra,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.480
which is six full tuned oil drums at one time.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.280
Is that right? You're a bass player.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.920
That's right. 45 gallon oil drums.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:01.080
I started with five and went on to play six and ended up actually being a guest at Notting Hill Panorama

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.000
Steel Orchestra Festival.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.640
So that was Steel Pan. That's how you first met Carla Carnival and Swicker.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.040
Yes.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.840
But obviously, costumes soon loomed fresh in your life.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.280
So what was the first Cardiff Mask Carnival as it was then that you came to the carnival camp

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.120
and got involved with your children, one of whom, of course, is Katie and is with us today.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:36.960
Hello. I was like waves, like in an orange and yellow little pants and like fire was it almost.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.760
Ninnian Park School.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.840
How old would you have been at the time?

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.720
1991. So I would have been six.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.960
That's fantastic. It's a very young age to get involved.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.440
And right early at the beginning as well.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.480
And so, Marion, what do you remember of that carnival camp?

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.520
I remember that I roped a couple of friends in and one was actually eight months pregnant at the time.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:07.600
And she turned out to be dressed as waves while the children went on to be dressed as other characters.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:16.360
And I ended up on the back of a float playing my heart off with the Swicker All-Star Steel Band.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.680
1991 was the year, of course, that we put the Cardiff Mask Carnival together with the Butetown Carnival.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:29.240
So I have memories of you being on the back of a lorry in your red t-shirt playing like a demon.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.440
And, you know, wonderful, wonderful carnival music on steel pans.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.360
One, because you're not huge, are you?

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:43.000
One, virtually challenged lady surrounded by six of gigantic bass bins,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.840
bass steel pans and just moving across them. You were like, I don't know.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.320
There was a blur. You were in motion all the time and dancing as you were doing it.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.240
Oh, yes. And I also broke my finger playing them.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.320
And my elbows took a couple of cracks.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:07.320
So I started wearing skateboarders elbow pads because I moved around so much to get from my front notes to my back.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:14.320
I often bash my elbows, thus bruising them and chipping them a couple of times.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.960
So the skateboarders elbow pads were fab.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:24.320
If I say the word pom pom, will you leave the room screaming in horror?

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.800
So pom pom horror. What does that involve?

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.800
Making thousands upon thousands upon thousands for one costume alone,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:42.080
which was a huge backpack costume depicting sort of the sun and the vibrance of the sun and its rays.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:49.280
We had to make one thousand inch long yellow pom poms of a certain firmness

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.920
that were literally sewn on the entire costume.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:00.680
And a woman called Monica wore the costume and looked absolutely amazing.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.800
And I can't tell you how high it was or wide it was.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.760
But those pom poms, I used to be in charge of asking people to make them in their spare time.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:19.240
And people used to literally run away from me and scream in horror if they saw me even pick up a little round cardboard circle and some wool.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.800
People wore them in their ears, on their shoes.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:30.080
We made jumbo size ones and people just got to dislike me intensely.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.000
It's the pop girl queen. Run for it.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:40.720
Yeah. Oh, God. So, Katie, I mean, you were very much grew up with at the mass camp, the carnival camp and the rest of it.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.680
What was it like? What sort of freedoms did you have?

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.680
Because we were there for a purpose, but we were also there socially and the rest of it.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:55.080
And I just remember you being part of a, what can I say, sort of like a gang of urchins who were part of the inner circle.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.920
You're very much part of the family of creativity.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.320
So, yeah, what comes to mind?

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.480
I mean, I understand that upon occasion, you may have even slept in the carnival camp.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:10.320
Is that right? Yeah, we've slept in material boxes in the foam room, anywhere, really.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.560
They had soft soft materials.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:21.680
Yeah. And we just put a bit of material on us and just sleep in the boxes while men were still making costumes and whatever else.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.560
It was just like one big family.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.880
Everyone knew each other and it was it was amazing to be a part of.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.440
But it was the best three weeks of freedom that I have had in my life.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.080
Just once a year.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:43.520
And of course, you both got involved in the very first times that we tried to extend the carnival experience by by having a pre carnival.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.520
Events based on that which you find in Trinidad and the Caribbean.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.000
Jouvet, which is short for the French, the Jouvet, the day opens.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.720
So it's a pre carnival event and it's very much based on dirty mass.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.960
What what what what can you tell us about the very first ever Jouvet?

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.160
The the yeah. Tell us what comes to mind.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:13.480
I think it was mud that we covered ourselves in and it was literally just put your hair in whatever style you wanted.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:19.080
I think I wrapped mine around coils of metal, so it looked like lots of snakes.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:27.320
And then we literally just grabbed handfuls of mud and water and just smeared it all over ourselves.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.200
So we were covered. It was everywhere.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:36.000
And then we just went out and just sang jab jab and just ran.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.600
Advertised the carnival to come.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.160
Try and get as many people to come.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:45.240
And I remember you and your brother actually saying to me, are we really allowed?

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.360
Yeah. As somebody said, I didn't quite have enough mud on me.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:56.880
And absolutely, I believe, tipped a bucket full over me until all you could see were my eyes.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.240
And it was a wonderful feeling, especially when it dried.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.400
I'm going to try something now.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.960
I'm going to give it a chance.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.480
See if you can respond. You know me well.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.360
Jab jab. I come from hell.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.840
Jab jab. There we have it.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.960
The very first chart for the famous you.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.360
You know, the jab jabs, the traditional devils that you find in the rest of it.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:23.040
Marion, you're a legend.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.120
You're carnival carnival legend, obviously.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.320
But amongst the many legendary things you have done,

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.440
you had a very interesting performance relationship with an Irish lady

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.040
for at least a couple of years called Dawn.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.080
Could you care to tell us about you and Dawn, particularly

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.520
if I were to say snakes?

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.360
Oh, yes.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.080
For future generations, this is a good one.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:55.600
Well, I only ever saw dear Dawn, who was Irish, once a year at carnival time,

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.320
and then we never got in contact or saw each other again.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.640
And we were told that we were born to be free spirits.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.960
So we kind of instead of staying in line, we were allowed to go

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.760
and kind of be the fools, the clowns and to get people laughing and smiling

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.280
and go amongst the the the crowd and everything.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.520
And also send messages at one time from one end of the carnival to the other.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.960
So we did quite a lot of running and slowly but surely we started off

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.320
quite clad in bright costumes.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.400
And then the clothes seemed to get less and the paint got more.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.240
I had the pleasure.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.160
And I'm not ashamed to say at the age of 40

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.080
was our

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.200
the best year of my life.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:44.400
I think I have never felt so liberated is when a body artist

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.280
painted us in black and vibrant blue.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.480
And we were symbolizing snakes.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.920
And I remember gyrating, which is a wonderful word,

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.240
dancing on the museum steps

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:02.320
and running through town with no clothes on, just body paint.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.320
And people don't believe you're going to be as you run past them.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.320
They don't quite their brains don't think that person hasn't got any clothes on

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.120
until you're already past them.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.760
And they kind of look and they say,

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.480
well, she or wasn't she wearing clothes?

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.480
And I remember that being the best experience of my life

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.720
from somebody that wouldn't even go topless on a beach

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.720
or wear a bikini, let alone anything else.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.120
But that's what mass did to me.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.120
That's an extraordinary experience.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.480
Of course, I can't be with us today.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.840
He's a resident in Milton Keynes.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.400
But your son, David, was very much part of

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.600
what the whole carnival experience and the crew, as it were.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.960
One costume in particular comes to mind.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.920
If I mentioned David as a frog,

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.520
and if I mentioned Jelly, would you care to explain how

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.000
how David brought his frog costume literally to life?

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.920
Oh, well, a lovely guy called Rob Davie

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:11.120
helped David and a friend of his make these wonderful frog costumes.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.400
And they actually appeared in South Wales Echo,

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.640
making the costumes and everything.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.440
And I found out afterwards that

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.800
they decided to make their costumes are a little bit extra special for the crowd.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.360
And it managed to install some sort of contraption.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.320
They held jelly about their person at which they spawned

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.760
at various times in the carnival at the delight of a lot of the crowd.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.240
They produced this jelly from either squirty bottles

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.880
or at one time their own mouths and water guns

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.000
and sort of fired this jelly, obviously quite safe jelly

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.240
that didn't stay enclosed.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.360
Thank goodness. Or we hope.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.840
And he had the whale of a time doing that.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.560
He was delighted, in fact.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.760
Katie's played a number of different costumes, but

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.920
I think one in particular might have some significance.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:12.600
There's an epic moment in the Cardiff Carnival's history where

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:18.120
one of the we used to have a finale on the steps of the National Museum

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.680
and generate huge audiences, perhaps 5000 strong big family audiences

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.920
who came to watch the finale.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.160
And we would often try to tell a story or more than one story

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.800
during the course of that.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.080
And one of the earliest and perhaps the first incarnations on the steps

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.560
involved a scene which was the battle between good and evil.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.480
And naturally, evil were

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.360
body painted devils who were armed with

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:51.000
quite sophisticated sort of booster water shotguns filled with

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.720
red dyed paint

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.040
to symbolize blood.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.120
And they they were basically I'll hand over the story to Katie,

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.840
who was a angelic, beautiful

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.640
angel in the most beautiful white wings and a carnival costume.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.480
But but but with only it had no color.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.440
It was just white.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.840
What do you remember of your angel death?

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.680
So we had to learn a dance by Maryanne, I think it was at the time.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.040
Like you said, we were, you know, beautiful angels.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.360
I thought I was in the bit as, you know, a lovely angel.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.640
And I didn't know what I was letting myself in for.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:35.600
And we did our dance, our routine that we learned on the museum steps.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:42.000
And then all of a sudden, we just got squirted and basically massacred

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.240
with red paint all over us.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.160
And we had to let out this scream

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.800
as though we were dying, which I'm drama

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.160
Rama anyway, so that was really easy for me.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.960
So we literally had to faint to our knees covered in this paint

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.520
over the top screaming, you know.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.360
Yeah. And I basically a lot of devil slaughtered

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.440
and put a lot of innocent dancing angels basically. Yeah.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.080
Can you remember the reaction from the audience of this?

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:19.720
Horrified. I think I don't think they quite got it, to be honest.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.440
But yeah, it was great fun,

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.160
especially being squirted with the bright red paint.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.360
But yeah, it was fun.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.360
But I was covered in paint for probably, you know,

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.920
can you remember when you probably went back to school?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.480
Remember when you finished all of a sudden,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.080
very carnivory, lovely music uplifting came on and you all resurrected there

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.480
and then and the audience actually had to cheer.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.720
I think we're brought back to life.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.080
We couldn't leave you dead on the steps of the National Museum.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.480
That would be right or appropriate, would it?

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.240
No, no.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.680
Again, back in the early days, we used to have

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.240
something like before health and safety was invented,

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:03.040
we would use inappropriate, safeguarded ways, I hasten to add

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.800
fire and even pyrotechnics.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.400
I believe you.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.120
I mean, we used to have an expert, a pyrotechnician,

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.120
a professional pyrotechnician called Alan May come over from Bristol

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.000
in the final week of the carnival camp.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.760
And he would think how we could

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:26.520
fix up certain costumes on everybody with some pyrotechnic elements.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.520
I believe you enjoyed some of these.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.680
Tell us about your pyrotechnic moments in the early carnivals.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.880
So we were my myself, my brother and a couple of his friends.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:43.680
We were dressed in white outfits that we'd roll tires over to look like

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.800
like road markings all over us.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.080
And we had these

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.280
hats that were shaped like cars made out of bamboo and

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.280
paper mache.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:00.320
And we walk in down the street and they decided to make some exploding dice.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:05.040
And they were literally just like fluffy red material made into dice.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.680
But little did we know what was inside them.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.760
So they were firecrackers, which were amazing, considering

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.680
we weren't allowed to play with anything like that.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:18.360
So to be just given free, you know, of these exploding dice,

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.920
my brother thought it was amazing more than me, I think.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.880
But yeah, he went on to join the army. He did. Yeah.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.240
There could be a link between these two things.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.680
But they were the most wildest firecrackers ever.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.960
They would literally, you know, you'd have to be quick in throwing them.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.360
Otherwise, you'd probably have your hand taken off by them.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.720
Oh, yes.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:46.440
And in many senses, we are very fond memories of the time.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.000
And certainly when we were at Kutais Community Centre and would

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.360
would line up and of course, if you know the location,

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.120
we would line up and in a sense would finally come in

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:02.160
to order as we began to crest the Kutais bridge before turning into the civic centre.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.800
Marion, I mean, what was it like

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.760
sort of cresting that bridge and looking behind you?

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.360
I remember. Oh, I remember making a point

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.920
and I was ready and everyone was lined up, just warming up

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:19.960
the various different bands, all the sections getting in together and everything.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.040
And I ran ahead to be on the brow of the hill.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.200
I think I was hoping to take a couple of pictures,

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:30.400
but there's not many places to hide your camera when you haven't got many clothes on.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.800
I just remember suddenly the setting off

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:41.320
and it took my breath away and I was so proud to be a part of it.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:47.080
And it was like a beautiful sea of all the different sections coming down the streets.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.040
And I was just breathtaking.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.960
It was thrilling. It was I can't describe in words.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.600
And it was so vibrant and so multicultural

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.440
because there was so many people had taken part, kids, elderly people,

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.920
people with pushchairs.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:07.120
But the sections were absolutely amazing.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.840
And to think all of this was made out of bits

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.120
and from absolutely nothing.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.320
Nothing was bought, made.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:19.720
It was all made just by volunteers and hard work

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.360
and workers that were guiding us.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.640
And it was absolutely stunning.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.920
So, Katie, as a very young child, you ended up performing

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.080
on the finales on the steps of the National Museum.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.960
I mean, what was that experience like for you?

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.320
What was it like to see that big an audience and to perhaps hear that?

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.000
I mean, they used to cheer and all the other.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.520
What can you remember? What did it feel like?

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.280
It just felt like, I don't know, really, just

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.680
just like I was doing it just naturally.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.320
I just, you know, I was brought up to it from being six years old

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.400
and walking through town and obviously having a mother that ran through naked.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.080
You know, so when I went back to school, I was always reminded of that.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.840
But it was just amazing to just because everyone was such like a family.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.760
And you knew if, you know, if you turned somewhere and saw someone,

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.040
you always you were always going to know them.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:17.000
And, you know, it was just it was amazing to just be given that freedom.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:21.160
You know, not only one night, but obviously for the three weeks that we did

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.400
carnival, it was, you know, I looked forward to it.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.200
You know, in both your cases, if you had to name

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:33.120
your personal favorite costume, because you've got so many to

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.600
or you can name more than one.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.520
But which costumes out of the many you've played come to mind?

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:44.800
Probably be me being a firefly with Natasha, Davey

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.240
and a child of confusion, because I literally just walked around

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:53.520
looking confused for the entire carnival

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.640
and jab jabs, because that was just, you know, that was amazing.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.920
Just being dressed like that.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.240
A few marrying what we stand out costumes.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:08.520
I adored being a dragon and I each one had its own

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.440
individual kind of theme.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:15.000
And but I must admit, I cannot get over the fact

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.360
that I danced on that museum steps with nothing but body paint on.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:24.840
And the feeling was I don't think even when I'm old, I'll look back at that.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.680
And I'll never forget it as long as I live.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.600
And I was a few pounds lighter, I think.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.440
Marianne and Katie, big, big thanks for all your carnival memories.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.080
I think this is a particularly pointed and wonderful interview.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:45.200
I suspect we may do this again in a few weeks because,

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.680
you know, you've just got you were so much part of it all

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.360
and lived it and embodied it.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.640
But at this point, I have to award you both

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.920
kind of carnival hero status.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.360
Marianne and Katie, thank you for the day.
