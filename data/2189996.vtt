00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
This is Vicki MacDonald in Holy Trinity Church, Landernau, during the longest yarn.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.640
I'm talking to Eric Smith, who has memories of his childhood during the war.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.640
Thank you, Eric.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.200
So, where do you want to start?

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.000
What do you want to talk about?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:26.660
Well, I was born in 1936, so I was almost three years old when the war started.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.740
We lived in a fairly remote home near the top of the Pennines between Lancashire and

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.140
Yorkshire.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.700
We had no air raid shelter there, I'm happy to talk about that.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:50.020
So when the sirens went to indicate that there were enemy aircraft around, my mother, my

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:56.140
father and myself, we had to shelter under the table in the living room.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.340
That was the only â€“ the house was a stone-built house.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.100
I do clearly remember one night the sirens went off.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.940
We did go under the table and two bombs dropped close by, shaking the house.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.100
I thought it was going to collapse.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.460
I can remember that this was in the middle of the night.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.060
I don't know, I'd be about four years old, I suppose.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.020
I remember going out and standing on the edge of the craters made by the bombs because they

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.300
landed in fields near where we lived.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.120
I can still remember standing on the edge and looking down into the crater.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.340
No people were killed, but a lot of chickens and hens were at the time, but we lived in

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.340
the country then.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.940
So your father was in an occupation?

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.100
My father was in what was called a reserved occupation.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:03.980
So he wasn't called up for military service in that sense because he worked in a textile

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.620
mill which made the cloth for the uniforms for the military.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.980
You kind of forget things like that, don't you?

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.260
He couldn't leave that occupation either.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.340
He didn't particularly care for the work he did, but that's what he'd been brought

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.680
up to do since leaving school.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.340
Because it was reserved, he could not leave until the very end of the war.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.540
On the very first day after the end of the war, he did in fact leave and move to another

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.540
job.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.020
As indeed, there were coal miners and people like that who had to work.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.060
You couldn't move to another job.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.500
He did his bit though in the evenings.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.500
You said you moved?

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.700
Yes, he did move a little nearer to the mill where he worked and a little more populated

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.820
area.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:12.380
In order to help the fire brigade, what was formed called the Auxiliary Fire Service,

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.980
which later became the National Fire Service.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.420
So my father was not only working during the day, in the evening he was called out to put

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.340
fires out and to train and do all the things, learning how to tie knots and things.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:37.140
I can remember my father having the book showing how to do these things that firemen

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.620
have to do, etc.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.580
So did he go out most nights?

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.700
No, only when he was caught really.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:52.540
In fact, I don't actually recall him going out to where a bomb had dropped, for example,

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:00.260
Nevertheless, there were fires and he went to a very big mill fire, a huge fire.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.060
But nevertheless, he had to be available.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.580
He was on call, shall we say.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.220
And your mother, was she working also in the cellar?

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.220
No, no.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.420
She looked after...

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.660
She stopped working and was at home with me at the end of the war.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.900
So they both survived the war and life went on?

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.900
Yes, indeed.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:23.900
Yes, yes.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.900
Good to know.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:32.980
I can remember, obviously, afterwards you can look back and think what did I miss?

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.220
It's silly little things.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.420
I used to see railway trains and it said on the side, Palethorpe's sausages.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:47.580
Now I had not the slightest idea what a sausage was because I'd never actually heard or seen

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.900
of sausages and things like that.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.020
I don't know why, but it was an odd thing.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.420
There were other things that were fairly common.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:02.500
Obviously, many people can tell you about, I'd never seen a banana before and I wonder

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.500
what the...

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.660
I saw someone in a cinema queue eating this strange curved fruit and I went home and said

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.980
to my mother, I've seen someone eating a strange curved fruit.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.100
She says, oh yes, that will be a banana.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.300
Simple little things.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.800
Thank you, Eric.
