Argl Cerf

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
When Puppet's head, so far away to shout,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Suddenly no one can hear.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Police says they're tired,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
For they broke in the street,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Come all the way by,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
There's no this way.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Out in the rain,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
They call him a hoot,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Suddenly no one can hear.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Then the birds jump together,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And the puffer's over,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Gotta be a little while away.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And they're making their decisions,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And they're inviting them to come.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And let it be like this,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
My home is close,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And there's no cry,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Out in the rain,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
There's no this way.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Out in the rain,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
They call him a hoot,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Gotta be a little while away.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And they're making their decisions,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And they're inviting them to come.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Then the birds jump together,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And the puffer's over,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Gotta be a little while away.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And they're making their decisions,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And they're inviting them to come.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Then the birds jump together,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And the puffer's over,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Gotta be a little while away.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And they're making their decisions,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And they're inviting them to come.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And let it be like this,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
My home is close,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And there's no cry,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Out in the rain,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
There's no this way.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And there's no this way.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Gotta be a little while away.
