00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.260
Let us firstly say thank you to Heritage Lottery Wales for supporting this short project of

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:20.240
memories of people who lived and were from Butetown, Tiger Bay, the docks.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.180
And I hope you find the time to listen to it fully.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.180
This next one is from Dold Salomon.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:42.180
My name is Dold Salomon. My dad was Ali Salomon, who ran the Cairo Calf at 236 Bute Street.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.180
I was born and raised in Butetown and I still spend most of my time in Butetown.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.180
Let me interrupt very briefly there the conversation with Dold.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:05.180
This next clip is from a BBC program in 2011. It was originally recorded in 1968.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.180
And I don't think he, and he doesn't know I'm putting this into the podcast.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:23.180
This is Dold's mother, Olive Salomon, talking about bumping into his father outside the Cairo Café when she was 15.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.180
And she was a nurse on her way back from the cinema. And she was from the valleys.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:41.180
My dad had just opened up the Cairo Café, not long, and he happened to be standing outside on the front door.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:50.180
I stopped and asked this boy then the way to Queen Street. And he said I was losing my way to the docks.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.180
And we started talking. I think we fell in love there and then.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:02.180
We got married when I was 16 and three weeks actually. I had five children before I was 21.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.180
We got, we had ten children, five boys and five girls.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:16.180
Of course when I got married there was a great stir at home because the priest from the church even came and told my mother that

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.180
marrying an Arab, I was marrying a heathen. There was quite a stir at home.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:38.180
Let's return to the interview with Dold, which was recorded by the way during lockdown on the 24th of February 2021.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:50.180
Now to mention a bit about Butone, when I was born and grew up in Butone, it was a unique place.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:03:00.180
We had people there from every part of the world. Everybody treated their neighbors and friends.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.180
We were all welcome. Nobody looked at the color of anybody.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:12.180
You didn't even think of the color of this person was a different color to be on. That person was a different color.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:21.180
We looked at people and took them for what they were. And people didn't have a lot in those days.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.180
But what they had, they were prepared to share with one another.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.180
If somebody was in trouble, people would run to their aid and try to help them as best they could.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:41.180
You had many people described Butone as a place not to go to.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:48.180
But you had some of the nicest people in the world you could ever meet or come across.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.180
Growing up, we had no problems in Butone.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:11.180
It was when we went over the bridge and through the traffic lights into outside Butone that we encountered people abusing us, calling us names and things.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.180
We weren't bad people, but we were able to defend ourselves. And defend ourselves we did.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.180
We put a lot of those problems with ignorance and lack of knowledge.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.180
Because later on, we became friends with those people and we all grew up.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:36.180
A lot of people succeeded in businesses and whatnot. But we managed to keep a friendship going.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:44.180
No, today, rather when they began to demolish Butone, they split up a very tight community.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:51.180
And people were sent out to these new estates while they were knocking down the buildings.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.180
And there were some beautiful buildings there.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.180
If the government could have only had foresight and redeveloped those homes, it would have been lovely.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.180
They were beautiful buildings. They had character.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.180
But then they decided to build what we've got there today.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.180
And it's a different place altogether now.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.180
Those people left and went to other communities.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.180
And the community was split.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:24.180
And then, you know, to rub people's face in it, they brought other troublesome families from outside of Butone to Butone.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.180
And those people had a bit of respect, to respect the elderly.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.180
And we did. But the place is not the same, though.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.180
Butone's not the same.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.180
And it was a great place to grow up in.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:47.180
It didn't matter what religion you were or what country you came from.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.180
Everybody was treated exactly the same.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.180
And we all took part in our religious festivals and whatnot.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:59.180
The Christian sector of the community would come and celebrate with us at the end of Ramadan.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.180
And, you know, we'd cook lots of food and share it with the community.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.180
People used to look forward to it. It was nice.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:18.180
Even on the Wits and Treats, there'd be more kids in Sunday school, more Muslim kids, than Christians, to get a ticket to go on the Wits and Treats.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.180
You know, this is how it was.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.180
Nobody got turned away because they were a different faith or anything.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.180
We were all one. And they were good, happy days.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.180
And in those days, we used to go on the Wits and Treats on the back of a lorry.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.180
We had clacks, transport.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:41.180
We used to provide the church with a couple of wagons, and they'd put all the church pews on the back.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.180
And that's what we said. They probably couldn't do it today.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:50.180
But they were good days. And we went off into the countryside and had a nice day.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.180
For the kids, that would have just been an adventure.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:59.180
Oh, oh, God. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, everybody used to look forward to it coming.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:07.180
It was great. And there was no hassle. You know, it was lovely.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:15.180
One of my early memories of the bay is my uncle Darwin, Darwin Hinds.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.180
Oh, I know Darwin. I knew Darwin.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:23.180
Yeah, my uncle Darwin brought me down to the mosque when I was a kid.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:30.180
Yeah. Yeah. Well, Darwin, you know, he was a special person in itself

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:35.180
because he was very big friends with our late Checksite.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.180
And they were very close.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:44.180
And Delgado and that, they were all sort of pals together.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.180
And Darwin converted to Islam.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:53.180
That's right. I mean, he was a wonderful leader, Checksite, a wonderful leader.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.180
He was a wonderful man, you know, difficult to replace.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:02.180
Well, we never replaced him, you know. He was a special person.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:09.180
And Darwin contributed a lot to his faith in Cardiff and in Barry.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.180
Yeah. Yeah.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:14.180
Because he enabled us to purchase the old police station there.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.180
And that was converted into a place of prayer, mosque.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.180
You know, Darwin helped us a great deal in doing that.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:25.180
They were good days. They were good days, the old days.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:29.180
Things have changed and I don't think it's for the better.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:34.180
It was much better in those days than what it is now.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.180
Where did you go to school, Don?

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:39.180
I went to school South Church Street.

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:44.180
That was just across the road from St. Mary's Church there up on Bute Street.

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:49.180
It was in South Church Street and the school was called South Church Street,

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:55.180
which the majority of the Bute Town families, they all went there.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:59.180
And we had some very special people as well who did well for themselves.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:03.180
And they all started off in South Church Street.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:09.180
You know, Billy Boston, fantastic rugby player.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.180
He represented the community.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:15.180
And yet because of his colour, he was denied to play with whales.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:22.180
I mean, later on, he was well capable of playing for whales and he would have done well.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:26.180
But you have these stupid, I don't know what you say,

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:32.180
people who use colour and whatnot to prevent somebody getting on in life.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:37.180
The trouble with Billy Boston and Freeman and a load of them is

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:42.180
not only were they black, but they were also working class.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.180
That's right, exactly.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:51.180
Which is one of the reasons all the white people who were in the bay got on with the black people.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.180
They were all working class.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.180
Yeah, exactly.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.180
We were all one.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.180
We didn't see anybody was better than the other all.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.180
We were all the same.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:06.180
And like later on, Billy Boston, he was lucky enough that the Scouts came along

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:11.180
and he was playing with the kayaks and they picked him and took him up north.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.180
And the people up there in Wigan, they loved him.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:18.180
They took him into their house and he did them prog.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:25.180
And it was because of his ability to play rugby, not because of his colour or anything.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:31.180
They appreciated him for what he did and they loved him.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:36.180
But today we've got problems with the youth.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.180
They've got nothing to do.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:44.180
The clubs are all closed and they're hanging about on the streets with nothing to do

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.180
and they get into a bit of mischief from time to time.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.180
Other people have mentioned Chalky White's place.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:54.180
Oh, Chalky White, he kept them in hand.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.180
He was brilliant.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:01.180
He run the youth club there and he did a great job.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.180
He would take no messing off.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:08.180
Nobody like you, you all came in and listened to the rules and regulations.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.180
As long as you stood by them, you were fine.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:14.180
But if you crossed, he could deal with you.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.180
He was a great man.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:22.180
One of the things that worked was when the parents handed over the kid to Chalky White,

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:26.180
it was clear he's the man in charge.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.180
Yes, that's right.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:33.180
He was trusted and he always looked out for the benefit of the youth.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.180
And this is why he got on with the youth.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:42.180
He wanted to help the youth get on and make something of their lives and whatnot.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.180
And he did all he could to help them.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.180
He was a great man.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:54.180
What was it like when you left school and you were trying to get work?

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.180
What was that like?

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:03.180
Well, in those days, in the docks, because the majority of people were OXC men and whatnot,

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:08.180
the thing was that when you left school, everybody wanted to go away to sea.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:17.180
I went down to the shipping federation and I got the forms to join up as a merchant seaman.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:21.180
And my dad had to sign the papers.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:28.180
And I took it back home to my dad and my dad looked at it and he ripped the papers up.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.180
That's what he thought were my choice.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:43.180
But he said to me, go and see if you can find an apprenticeship and learn something and do something with your life.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:51.180
And funny enough, the next day, there was a lot of industry in Cardiff in those days.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:13:00.180
And I went out the following day and I found a job as an apprentice fitter turner.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.180
I was so happy because I walked in very cheekily.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:14.180
And the guy that gave me the job, he worked in a company called Trouble Cane Foundry and Engineering.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.180
And it was a top company.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:25.180
They, I think, the propeller for the first Queen Elizabeth was cast there.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:34.180
They did a lot of, you know, they were the foundry, they cast the material there and then went into the machine shop for machining.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:40.180
And then he was a French guy who looked after the engine sector.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:46.180
They built these old pumps and generators and whatnot there.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:51.180
They'd taken over a company called Imperial Keighley from up north.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:14:02.180
And he was in charge of building all these engines, different types of engines, which were sent all over the world, you know, countries like third world countries.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:09.180
There were lots in Brazil, in Peru, those kind of places, and they used them for all sorts of things.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:18.180
I got a job with him and he took me in hand, gave me the job and he looked after me throughout my apprenticeship.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:32.180
And when I was four and a half years into my apprenticeship, I approached Reardon Smith, which was an old shipping company in Cardiff,

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:36.180
and applied for a job there as a junior engineer.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:43.180
And they gave me the job and they gave me a sub to go buy my uniform and whatnot.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:49.180
And we had a shop down in James Street, Silvers.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:56.180
And when you went down there, he kept you out with all the necessary things that you need.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:00.180
And off I went with Reardon Smith.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:11.180
Later on, I came home. My dad had passed away by then and my mother was hoping to take on one of the new buildings that they'd built

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:16.180
and open it up as a cafe to commemorate my dad.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:24.180
So I had to take some time off to help her because she was getting on by then.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.180
But it wasn't my thing, you know.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:35.180
So I took time off there, a couple of years of it, and then I went back into the shipping.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:42.180
And I worked for a company who employed a lot of the people from Butone.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:46.180
A lot of the people had good Christmases and whatnot from this company.

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:56.180
A company called, it was Worldwide Marine Engineers at first, and it changed later on to Cardiff Craftsmen.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:02.180
We managed to get a contract with PNORM, repairing their ships.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:07.180
And, you know, I spent 30 odd years doing that.

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:15.180
We'd fly out. If there was an emergency or anything, they'd call us and we'd have to be ready to go like that.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:23.180
And it was great because at one time there was about four of us in the team.

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:28.180
We all grew up together. We went to school together.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:33.180
And we worked together, you know, for a long, long time.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:37.180
And, you know, we just got on great with each other.

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.180
It was nice.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:50.180
And we earned the respect of the PNOR offices and whatnot because they gave us a name.

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:55.180
The Welsh Wizards, they used to call us.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:17:03.180
Because we used to go out and we'd perform some big jobs, you know, which were dry dock jobs, really.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.180
But we'd do them at sea while the ship was working.

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:11.180
And, you know, the passengers didn't know what was going on down below.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:14.180
And we saved them a lot of money.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:18.180
So, and they showed their respect to us, you know.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.180
And it was good.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:31.180
And whenever we took somebody new who was from Buton, they used to say, hey, this is great, man. I made it.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:37.180
One day we're in America, next day Mexico, next, you know.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:44.180
And, you know, they were, I mean, an opening like that is very difficult to find.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.180
Yeah.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.180
But they were good boys.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:52.180
And whenever we needed them to pull their socks up, they did.

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:55.180
And we were repaid by PNOR.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.180
PNOR loved us, you know.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:05.180
And they kept on using us until they went over to America then.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.180
And they were bought out.

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:08.180
And things changed.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.180
And the management changed.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.180
And the whole structure of PNOR changed.

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:17.180
But we had 30 odd wonderful years with them.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.180
Let me take you back.

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.180
Cairo Cafe.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.180
That's a legend.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.180
That's a legend in a way.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.180
Tell me more about the Cairo.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:39.180
Well, when my dad first came over to this country, he used to work in one of the boarding houses.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.180
He was a top cook, you know.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:51.180
And of course, whilst he was working in this boarding house, people started to come and eat there and it became great.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:58.180
And this guy wanted my dad to marry his daughter.

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.180
And my dad wasn't too keen on it.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:09.180
So he'd been saving up his coppers and whatnot.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:18.180
And he had enough to rent 236 Bute Street and opened it up as the Cairo Cafe.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:24.180
And in those days, he bought secondhand furniture and whatnot, you know.

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:29.180
And his luck was opened up there.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.180
And he did well.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:34.180
And then he was able to purchase the property.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:42.180
And he went on to purchase 234, 235, and 236 four-hoses.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:51.180
And inside, we had about 40 rooms, which he sort of joined them everything together.

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:58.180
And we had lodgers there with the Yevheny Sibin, also Mali Sibin.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:04.180
And, you know, things went well for him.

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:09.180
And his luck turned up, but he never forgot where he came from.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:13.180
Because my dad would never throw food away.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:18.180
And he always taught us to respect food and not to abuse it.

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:27.180
And every night, all the, you know, the donor notices would turn up.

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.180
And he'd give them whatever food was left from the day.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.180
He'd give it all to them.

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:37.180
And they used to come every night and line up.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:43.180
And when my dad passed away, they all came as well to see him off.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:47.180
And it was very sad to see them, you know.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.180
Yeah.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.180
But he did well.

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:56.180
And, you know, everybody respected him.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.180
He had a good life.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:02.180
During the war, he was in an air raid shelter.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.180
Air raid warden.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.180
Yeah.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.180
You know, with many of the other people.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:17.180
And they'd go out in the night searching the bomb buildings and whatnot.

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:21.180
And helping the people with whatever they had to do.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:26.180
And, you know, no big thing was made of it.

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:28.180
You know, people did what they had to do.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.180
And that was it.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.180
It was their community.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:36.180
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:43.180
And like I say, people from all different nations, but everybody worked together lovely.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:48.180
I mean, one of the things you're saying about your father passing and people being there.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:57.180
People talk about funerals and the way people are respectful in funerals around Butown and the Bay.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.180
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:04.180
And it doesn't matter what religion it is.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:10.180
You know, everybody will come out to see the person off.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.180
You know, the...

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:18.180
Well, in later years, you had Peter Phillips like he sounded a band up.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:27.180
And he did like the old New Orleans type funeral where he'd be up the front in front of the hearse banging away.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.180
And it was great.

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:32.180
Like, you know, it gave a little bit of spirit.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:36.180
It made the funeral a little bit more cheerful.

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:46.180
And of course, everybody and people would carry their deceased all up Beach Street up to the as far as the church.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:51.180
Because our place, we were very close to St. Mary's Church.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:59.180
And, you know, everybody had come out to watch the, you know, the passing of the funeral.

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.180
Yeah. It was great.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:06.180
I mean, I can remember Michael Darwin's funeral.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.180
And they had to close the middle of town.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:16.180
I don't think they realized just how seriously people took funerals.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.180
Yeah. That's right. Yeah.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.180
And, you know, and the people...

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:24.180
And that thing about burying, you know, filling in the grave.

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.180
Yeah.

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:28.180
Shift back. The guy's just doing it.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:33.180
That's emotional, that is, I think. I think that's really special.

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:40.180
It is. It's a very nice thing to do for the families, respectful to the families.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:48.180
Because, you know, even people from St. Mary's Church, when they were buried, they'd still fill in the...

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:54.180
You know, the local people would still fill in the grave once they were there.

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:57.180
And it sort of caught on.

00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:01.180
And it was a great thing, you know.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:05.180
I mean, I always thought of that as being a Muslim tradition.

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.180
That it shifted over.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:11.180
And now that says so much about faith.

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.180
That this is the tradition of one faith.

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:15.180
That's right.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:16.180
But people did it.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:20.180
And, you know, it just shows that level of respect.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.180
It's very, very special.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.180
Oh, it's very special, yeah.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:26.180
Very special.

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:35.180
I mean, there was no hatred or anything like some of the things that we have today, you know.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:40.180
We've got these wild Muslims who were miseducated.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.180
And they carry out atrocities.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.180
None of that, them days.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.180
It was pure Islam.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:50.180
And Islam is a religion.

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.180
It means peace, you know.

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:57.180
I mean, to go and take somebody's life.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:03.180
Or do mischief as a thing to people.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:09.180
That's not looked at as very good in Islam.

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:13.180
But like you say, that was a tradition.

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.180
The Muslims always did it.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.180
They're deceased.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:31.180
And, you know, it was the youth of the community that carried that on to the Christian burials.

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:34.180
Yes, it was very nice.

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:39.180
Well, as you say about your dad and feeding people who had nothing.

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:43.180
That's another concept of Islam. Charity.

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.180
Exactly, yeah.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:53.180
I mean, it doesn't matter what religion, whether you're Jewish, Christian, or Muslim.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.180
The aim, the books are all the same.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:59.180
The story in the book is exactly the same.

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:04.180
And, you know, it's a way of life.

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:09.180
And God is trying to teach us to live a good life.

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:13.180
And he promises us a better life in the year after.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:20.180
And if we succeed, you know, so really we're all connected.

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:23.180
And we all come from Adam and Eve.

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:26.180
So we believe.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.180
So what does that tell you?

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.180
We're all related.

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:33.180
So we should get on better with one another.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:41.180
And literally in the Bay and Bute town, so many families have cross-married and all the rest of it.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:47.180
And still people in the same family worshipping differently.

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.180
Yes, that's right.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.180
It's amazing. You know, it's unique.
