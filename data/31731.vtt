00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:48.440
I will dance and I will dance and I will dance at the moon tide.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:02:01.640
I will dance and I will dance and I will dance again.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:10.800
I will dance at the full moon tide. Here is no place a man can hide until sun shifts in,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:19.280
burnishing to gold. I will dance right on as the dance unfolds, as the dance unfolds.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:30.720
I will dance into this bright land, take the sea path across the strand. To the storm dark night

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.960
I will reach the shore, joining with the one who has gone before, who has gone before.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:56.880
This is the song of Caridwen, Caridwen's song.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:06.160
I will dance and I will dance and I will dance again.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:50.160
I will dance and I will dance again.
