00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.600
Fantastic. Okay, well first things is details so can you please tell us your name and where

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.600
and when you were born?

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:23.800
My name is Fisela Ali and I was born in South America, Guyana. It's on the North Atlantic.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.200
It's by the Amazon rainforest.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.800
Do you remember that area that you grew up on?

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.200
Yes, I do. Yes, because I have many lakes and the Atlantic Ocean and I was overlooking

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:44.200
the Atlantic Ocean. It's interesting. It's on the Essequible Coast of Guyana.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.200
What was it like growing up there?

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:57.200
Oh, it was lovely. It was very homely. The people are very laid back and happy. You know,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:07.200
they had a good nature.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.200
What was it like growing up in the house? What was the household like?

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:25.200
The house was, I had eight sisters so it was interesting. My mom and dad.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:34.200
What was your favorite memory of your childhood? Is there one particular or is there multiple?

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.200
I think because I was the eldest, everyone like played a part and I used to enjoy that.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:58.200
Everyone used to make fuss out, you know. It was a happy occasion. I used to feel happy, everyone together.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:07.200
What do you think about the difference between the childhood there and here as well?

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:16.200
I think the childhood there is much better. It's more open and you can see people come to you.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.200
You don't go to the people. I think it's more friendly.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.200
Is there one event or celebration that stands out to you?

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.200
I used to take part in different celebrations. Not a special one.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:45.200
I think it's like whatever celebration is around, we used to take part in that.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.200
Like what? I'm not sure.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:03:00.200
Different cultural celebrations. Whatever is around. We used to take part in it.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:13.200
As a child or a young person, was there anything that was really exciting about the celebration?

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:26.200
I used to like sports. Like going to look at sports. Cricket, football, that sort of thing.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:34.200
Other celebrations like the Muslim celebration, Hindus, the Christians.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:47.200
The schools over there, when you go to the school, they take you to all these places like to the churches and the temple and the mosque.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:57.200
So yes, we used to take part in things which is good. It's different over there from over here. I know it is.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.200
Speaking over here, what made you decide to come to the UK?

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.200
I came for a marriage purpose.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.200
Did you have any expectations of the UK?

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:21.200
No. I came as a teenager so it was difficult for me to understand what it's like.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.200
I came when I was young.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.200
How old were you?

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:34.200
About eighteen. I came on my own so it was different.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:43.200
What I noticed over here is that it's like a colder country and people are more reserved.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:55.200
So it's difficult to... even communication I find it a bit difficult.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:05.200
Back home in South America it was much easier to get on with people.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.200
And it makes sense with what you just said about people coming to you as well?

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:17.200
Yes, the door is open and people come to you. It's different. I don't know about now but when I was growing up.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:26.200
It was like that. I think things are changing everywhere because of the technology.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.200
It's a digital world, isn't it?

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.200
What was the most important thing you think you had to leave behind?

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:42.200
I love my family and I miss that quite a lot.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:52.200
Because when I came here it was more like isolation and the weather wasn't great and I had to get used to people.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:58.200
So I think I was a bit more isolated when I came here.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:09.200
But now I'm getting a bit more open to get out and to meet people.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.200
How did you travel to the UK?

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.200
I came by air.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.200
What was the best or the worst thing about that journey?

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.200
Oh, it was hard. I was crying all the way.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:34.200
So it wasn't that easy for me.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:43.200
I think in my country I used to feel myself more. I had that nice feeling.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:52.200
When I came here it was like a cold feeling. I don't know if it's the weather. It could be.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:07:01.200
And a bit of isolation. It's different.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:08.200
I don't know. It could be the weather because in South America it's more tropical.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:14.200
And over here the weather, you have seasons, it changes quite a lot.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:19.200
It could be that. I'm not sure.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:28.200
Is isolation and the coldness and refractions?

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.200
When you're home there's a lot of people you can see and you can see a reflection.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:40.200
My parents had a big general store so I used to work in it since I was five.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:49.200
So I think that helped me to be among people. It was nice.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:08:01.200
I never felt sad or unhappy because people are around you all the time. So that was good.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.200
Does that mean all of you and your sisters as well?

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:13.200
Yes, sisters and brothers. I have brothers as well. Three brothers.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:19.200
When did you come to the UK and where did you land as well?

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:32.200
I came in the 70s. I landed in Heathrow. So I lived in London for a while. About three or four years.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.200
How did that feel? How did you feel arriving to the UK?

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:48.200
It was very dismal, dark. It wasn't attractive at that moment to me.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:55.200
Remember South America is more like the sunshine, the brightness, the people.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:07.200
Over here people are more indoor. You have to go out to certain things to be able to see people.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:13.200
When did you arrive in Newport then?

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:23.200
I lived in London for three or four years. Then went to the Midlands to live in Leicester.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:38.200
From Leicester I came to Wales. So that is a long time. 1968.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:52.200
Wales is much better. I think because it is smaller. You can get on a bit more with the people. But in London it was different.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.200
It is fast.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:01.200
So what was the decision to move to Leicester?

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:11.200
I think it is to do with my husband. He was moving to different places. So I had to follow him in that way.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:23.200
Coming and arriving to Newport, what can you remember about the first weeks or months that you were here?

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:33.200
I did like it. I did like Newport. I think because it is smaller and the people are a bit more friendly.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:47.200
Then I had a job in the hospital. So that helped quite a lot. Seeing people all the time. So it helped me. That was good.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.200
By seeing people you are interacting with people.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:59.200
Yes, interacting. It takes away things from your mind. It takes away all the negative feelings.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:05.200
Did that help them to not so much think about home?

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:15.200
Yes, that is right. It helped me. So that I don't have to think about where I came from.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:27.200
Wherever I settled I tried to make it my home. So that was good in that way.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:35.200
Then I had my three daughters growing up. So that was keeping me busy also.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.200
How many were born here in Newport?

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:45.200
Two were born in Leicester and one in London.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:55.200
As you were travelling and when you were in Newport, did you have any friends or family that joined you from Guyana?

00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:13.200
No, I didn't know anyone from Guyana. Just me. But I had other friends and neighbours. I just make friends with whoever is around me.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:23.200
You said about waking up late and then you were a nurse. You went into the hospital.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:33.200
I was assisting the doctors and midwives. So it was like chaperoning and assisting.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:47.200
That was very nice. I enjoyed that. I'm interacting with people of different levels. So that was good.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:59.200
I did enjoy it. It helps me a lot so I don't forget back home where I came from.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:09.200
I felt like a community. I felt nice as I'm in a community. So that was very good.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:15.200
Even to not forget back home, what could you say that you miss the most about?

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:37.200
I miss the family atmosphere. It's closer. It's a different feeling. I can't express it. It's a nicer feeling. I miss that close connection.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:49.200
I think it's a different upbringing back home from here. I notice.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.200
Definitely there's that big difference.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:14:03.200
It's a big gap really. Over here I can't feel that. Even with my children I notice they're different from me.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:19.200
I know they have their own personalities but I can see it. They can't imagine where I came from and how things are over there.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:29.200
They were born in these countries. They're adapting to these countries, which is good.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:37.200
What would you say, of course there's the family aspect, what could you say that you love the most about your culture?

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:55.200
I like the culture because it brings you together as a strong family unit. That nurturing is important. I did miss that with all my siblings.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:03.200
I like the community spirit. It's nice.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:09.200
Is there elements of your culture that you've made an effort to preserve?

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:25.200
I think over here it's very different. I tried my best because I don't go out a lot. I think Aged Alive helped me to get out a bit, to socialize.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:35.200
That was good because then I can see different people from different parts of the world, different nationalities.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:45.200
In that way it's good because then I can interact a bit more.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:57.200
I've got a little grandson and he's keeping me busy at the moment. I have to lay apart with him at the moment.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:09.200
I'm trying to know myself. It took me a long time. As I'm getting on, it's only now I'm getting to know myself.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:19.200
Is there certain foods, music that's helped you?

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:27.200
I like all sorts of different cultural music. I like different types of food. I don't have a speciality.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:41.200
I like rice. I like a lot of Asian food as well as my own country food. I like different types. I like different tastes.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.200
What is the Guyanese food?

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:55.200
This is a cooker price, kechari, salt fish. They like salt fish. They like pepper pot.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:07.200
There's a lot of plantain and cassava dumplings. They eat a lot of pepper.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:19.200
They grow it there. It's a lovely country. I miss it for all the different fruits.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:25.200
The tropical fruits are different from over here.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.200
When was your last return?

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:41.200
Since I came, I never returned. That's why it's sad. That's about four to seven years.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:47.200
Is there a particular reason or is it just not yet?

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:55.200
I think because of the kids. I had the children just after I got married.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:07.200
It prevented me from going. I was on my own, in isolation as usual. I had to look after them. It wasn't that easy.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:15.200
It was hard for me to make friends at that time of my life.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:21.200
As you spoke about friends and being out there, that age alive you said you spoke about.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:35.200
I think now because I stopped working, I never used to socialise much when the kids were younger.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:47.200
Because I was working in the hospital, I was tied up with that. Just going to work and back home.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:55.200
That sort of routine thing. It's only now I have the time to do a bit more.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:05.200
To go on outings and to get together. I don't do a lot but I try to whenever I can spare time.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:11.200
How did you become involved with Age Alive?

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:21.200
I think it was just after the lockdown I got to find out about Age Alive. Someone told me about it and decided to join.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:27.200
What can you tell us about your involvement with Age Alive?

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:39.200
I'm not totally involved in anything at the moment. I participate in events they have.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:49.200
I like to listen a lot. Whatever programme they're having, I try to take part whenever I can.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:55.200
Is there one event or a trip?

00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:07.200
I did go on the trips. They had a few other things I used to participate in.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:15.200
How do you think that Age Alive supports the ethnic groups over 50?

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:25.200
I think they're doing well. They're making progress. A lot of them are in the same type of situation.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:35.200
I think it's helping them to get together and to do things together. It helped me as well to get to know people.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:45.200
If you're in your home you can't get to know people. So this sort of environment is good to meet people.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:51.200
You said to learn about different parts of the world as well?

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:59.200
Yeah, that's right. I need to know that. I need to learn about different places in the world.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:09.200
I think that is important to hear about different stories, about different parts.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:15.200
I don't go to those parts of the world.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:23.200
Why is that also important for our young people, our next generation, to know and hear the stories about different parts?

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:31.200
I think it's very important. I don't think young people are so keen to know things like that.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:39.200
If they can get some feedback to know about different parts of the world, it would be good.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:49.200
Because my children, they don't really want to know. They're too busy and occupied with their own things.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:55.200
Even though they're still very, very young and they haven't got anything.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:05.200
I suppose when they get older they would want to listen a bit more. But at the moment they're distracted.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:17.200
This is a question that has come to mind now. If there was anything you could say to a younger version of yourself?

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:23.200
Of myself?

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:33.200
When I was young I was very sensitive and timid. I never used to speak a lot.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:45.200
I don't know if I was afraid of things. Although I was happy, I had that sort of sensitivity in me.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:57.200
I don't know. I can't explain more about it. Although I used to enjoy myself.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:07.200
But I was very sensitive and I get emotional as well. I don't know the reason behind that.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:17.200
Because it's my grandson. He's got a bit of that in him. I don't know what it is.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:21.200
What message can you give him or yourself?

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:33.200
Hopefully he will grow out of that. I hope so. Because the education system is different here.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:41.200
When you go to school they were very strict. You used to get smacked to be late.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:51.200
If you don't do things right you get a bit of punishment for that. So it could be that is why. I'm not sure.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:59.200
Have you kept any family heirlooms or photographs or ornaments?

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.200
I have. Some nice ones.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:08.200
Photographs? Why are they important to you?

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:22.200
It's important because I was born there. I have to remember that for my whole life. That's important.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:27.200
Beautiful. That's everything I have. All the questions here.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.200
I don't know if there's anything else you would like to share at all.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:41.200
I'm happy to be here to share certain things. I hope it's...

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.200
What should I say?

00:24:50.200 --> 00:25:02.200
I hope it would be okay whatever you are recording. But don't put that in my record.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:06.200
Thank you.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:10.200
Can you play it back for me to see? Because you had cut out some of it.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.200
Yes, in the text. I'll cut this now.
