00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I used to play swimming.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.560
I used to swim with my parents.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.400
Reading Signets was my first swimming club.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.880
No, Reading.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.320
I'm in two different swimming clubs.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.840
One club in Aberystwyth, locally.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.120
And I'm going to Cardiff, having a card of comedians.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.440
Canadian Branch.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.560
How long have you been going there then?

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.480
Quite a while.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.920
Over 20 odd years.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.240
I've been in the Special Olympics.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.200
Going back since I was quite young.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.040
All over the UK.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.040
Leicester.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.600
Sheffield.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.080
Portrante.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.800
Glasgow.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.280
And Belgium.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.560
I was a part of the Special Olympics GB team.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.880
I entered the European Games in 2014.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.440
I took Belgium away and I'm in the EuroStars.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.560
It's fun.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.040
It's quite a far from Scotland.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.080
England.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.560
Quite a lot in Scotland and England.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.320
And Wales is just the one.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.840
Training is different.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.080
But in competition...

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.720
the longest is 100 metres.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.080
The last one was in 2017.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.280
Of course, Covid played a part of it.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.520
So that would mean, go ahead.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.720
You have a lot of medals.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.120
I've been going back since the 1980s.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.480
When I first started swimming.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.360
Very close finishes.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.880
Still, I swim a lot tonight.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.880
I go to the P plus Greek.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.880
And how often do you go?

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.880
Every Tuesday.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.480
In squad training,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.960
normally somebody from the Cardiff Millions.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.960
All major competitions all over.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.960
South Wales.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.960
Llanelli, Gendydon, my coach.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.960
The Dome Park, even though I'm up in Kecamdee.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.560
Is there anyone else up here with you?

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.680
I'm the only one in the Special Olympics.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.680
You have a lot of medals.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.680
I've been going back since the 1980s.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.680
When I first started swimming.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.680
Very close finishes.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.680
Still, I swim a lot tonight.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.680
I go to the P plus Greek.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.680
And how often do you go?

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.680
Every Tuesday.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.680
In squad training,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.680
normally somebody from the Cardiff Millions.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.800
All major competitions all over.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.800
South Wales.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.800
Llanelli, Gendydon, my coach.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.800
Not really, because the Dome Park, even though I'm up in Kecamdee.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.800
Is there anyone else up here with you?

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.800
I'm the only one in the Special Olympics.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.800
How often would you say you go down then, do you think?

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.800
Sometimes at the gala.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.800
And do they happen quite often, the galas?

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.800
Sometimes and always.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.920
I go all the way to my PA.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.920
And I'm their coach.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.920
How are they being me?

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.920
They're in different sports.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.920
They're in different abilities.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.920
What words would you use to describe that?

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.920
In a culture.
