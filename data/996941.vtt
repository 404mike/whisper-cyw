Who is the prideful star that gleams,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:08.020
The room that brings the rich and free?

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:36.020
Who is the prideful star that gleams,

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:56.020
Who is the prideful star that gleams,

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:04.020
On to the land of the rich and free,

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:14.020

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:37.020
And how I know, that love I need,

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:46.020
My love I know, that love I need.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:58.020
O, what is that, the melody,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:08.020
Of which the children of the rich,

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:16.020
O, what is that, the melody,

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:27.020
Of which the children of the rich,

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:37.020
I never think of it alone.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:43.020
How can I say why, for death I kneel,

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:58.020
And how I know, that love I need,

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:21.020
My love I know, that love I need.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:29.020
Who is the prideful star that gleams,

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:48.020
The room that brings the rich and free?
