WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240
It actually worked.

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.440
You can remember it working, yeah.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.720
But that's all.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.480
Yes.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.880
I mean, and like I say, it was the son from the mill

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.480
was in school with me then.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.200
Right, we're talking now about the mill.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.960
It's sort of opposite the castle, isn't it?

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.760
Yeah, that's right.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.800
It was a Sunday, and he comes to Rader still.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.880
Right.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.680
Because I meet him, Miller, we call him.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.200
Yes.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.480
He was John Price.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.000
Yes.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.840
His name was John Price, but Miller, we called him,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.200
because he was at the mill.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.480
But I think they must have moved from there

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.520
at the end of the war or something like that.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.560
They moved out of town afterwards, I think.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.960
And then the next lot of people, because the people who

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.080
lived there afterwards, he was in the army in Germany

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.360
after the war.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.000
And his girlfriend in Germany married him,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.920
and they lived in the mill.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.200
Then there was a fresh load of kids there.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.840
That was the Jones family, was it?

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.840
Yeah, that's right.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.880
Yes, I know I was in school with the Jones family.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.720
Yes, that's right.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.480
That's right.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.480
They were the last there, I should imagine.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.840
Probably.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.360
So it probably stopped working sometime in the war,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.880
you think.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.960
Yeah, I would say they most likely stopped then going.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.600
And I remember Eric Davis, who was a lorry driver

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.800
and on the way bridge at the quarry.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.440
And he said, well, I used to drive a lorry down to it.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.000
But I mean, in those days, a lorry was like a pickup is today.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.640
It would have been a big lorry, because I remember saying,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.640
well, that's the trouble.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.520
You can't get a vehicle down there.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.040
And he said, we used to drive the lorry down and turn it

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.440
around and drive it back up.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.680
Turn it around, I mean.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.200
Yeah.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.880
Must have been enough room to turn it.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.120
Mind, there was a barn halfway up the hill, wasn't it?

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.200
It was open.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.840
Yes.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.000
You can remember that, I do.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.200
Yes, I think I do.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.840
I send you it in your home.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.560
I'm not too worried.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.160
I'll switch that off there.
