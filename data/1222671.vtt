Monty was described as a lovable character, an amazing character, a man of the people

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.220
I would describe him. Nothing was ever too much trouble for him. He was the most generous

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:21.080
person you would ever wish to meet. He never charged any charity or anybody for anything.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.220
Even to this day I've had conversations with people who remember him from those days. Even

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.240
An old teacher of mine from Marlborough Road School where he used to give them the decorations

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.900
at Christmas to decorate the school via us, myself and my two sisters. My recollections

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.580
of him, he smoked until he was about 75. He never ever took a driving test. He drove on

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.460
the wrong side of the road. If anybody was in his way he would just beep and it wasn't

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.100
until the age of, I think he was about 90 that his license was taken away from him after

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.100
he had an accident with a Rolls Royce. In my youth, obviously I was very close to Monty,

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.100
he used to take me to the football and introduce me to Cardiff City, which I still support

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:21.980
today. When I was very, very young, sort of under the age of 10, he used to take me along

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.460
and he was very friendly with all the police officers. He knew everybody and he used to

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.460
hand me to a police officer and tell him to take me into the ground and he used to walk

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.460
me through the front door down the tunnel and lift me up and put me into the enclosure

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.700
and tell whoever I was standing next to to look after me till after the game. I'd watch

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.660
the game and then the policeman would come and pick me up and I remember his name was

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.060
Sergeant Perks and he used to pick me up and take me back out and give me back to my grandfather

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:02.060
who would then take me home. And then in 1967, at the age of 12, I got my first season ticket

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:09.140
and I used to sit up in the grandstand near my grandfather and the fishers and I've been

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.700
a supporter ever since.
