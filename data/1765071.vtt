00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.640
Lewis of Vancouver at her home on June the 28th 1974. Now Mrs Lewis you were born in

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:18.920
Patagonia South America of Welsh parents. Yes I was. And would you like to tell me a bit about

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.560
your parents and how they came out to Patagonia? Yes they came out to Patagonia under the vessel

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.800
Vesta. It was called Vesta and they were there a couple of years before I was born. What was

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.080
your father's name? My father's name was Peter Jones. My mother Mary Jones. And where have they

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:52.480
come from in Wales? Well father come from Mold and mother come from Abergillw. They had moved

00:00:53.240 --> 00:01:01.400
they went to Staffordshire in England where my father worked. And then of course they heard of

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:08.480
these people going to Patagonia. They were just married the day or so before. They heard of these

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:15.320
going to Patagonia. So he said well we'll just sell out and go with them to this new country,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.800
make a start. So they got down there and there was nothing in the port, nothing there at all,

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:31.400
only a few corrugated houses, zinc houses. Which port is this? Madryn. In Patagonia. Yes in Patagonia.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:40.240
Well then it was sometime after that there was no no trains or anything there, nothing at all. So

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.280
they were going to build this railway. So father went out with them and of course he was the first

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:57.320
engineer on that railway from Madryn to Trelleu in the valley. And he was on that railway the whole

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:04.080
time he was there until we left to come to Canada. I forget now how many years it was now, I don't

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:15.040
just remember. However when we were leaving in his honour they gave us, put his first-class

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:23.960
coach on to take us as a family to the coast. Yes. They were only presidents and things that

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:31.360
rode on that coach but it was in honour of my father's work with the company. Now where were

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.600
you born? I was born in Port Madryn. Yes. And would you like to tell us where in Port Madryn

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.520
you were born? Well there was no place, it's only, there's just a sea and a few space and then the

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.240
hills you see. Yeah. Well of course it's one of these caves in the hills that I was born. And

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.840
was that where your parents were living at the time? That's where mother lived yes. That's where

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.000
they lived. There was no other place for them to live at the time. And then there was another thing,

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:07.440
there was no water there, no fresh water. So they had to have that brought in over the hills from

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:17.880
the Chippewa River to Port Madryn for drinking water. And they had to do the best they could out

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:26.840
of some more, what we'd call them sluice in Canada where the water stood you know. And mother said

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:36.360
that's the only thing they had to wash a few clothes. And when were you born there? Oh I was born there

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:46.400
in 1887. Yes. The 7th of May 1887. I was told in later years that I was the first white child born

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:59.240
there. In Patagonia. In Patagonia. In Madryn. I see. Yes. And I don't know if I should say that here. Yes.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.480
I wonder if I should say that mother was very ill. Yes. Yes. Of course mother was very ill and

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:14.320
there was no one there to help at all. So of course she nursed me and she had a very bad gathered

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:23.200
breast. Nine gathers on her breast. No doctors. Until finally they heard there was a doctor coming

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:35.000
through from Royal Magro and they stopped him and he lanced these for her. Yes I was called Margaret

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.800
Anne Jones but they told me afterwards I should have been called Margaret Madryn Jones being as I

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:51.640
was born in Madryn. Many Welsh people do in fact have their middle name, are given their middle name

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.360
after the place where they are born. That's right there's an awful lot of them that you know that.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:07.520
Yes. However there was a boy that was born in Trelleuw. He was born on Christmas Day and they

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:20.440
called him John Christmas Jones. Yes. Welsh was the language spoken mostly. Of course my mother

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:28.160
didn't speak Welsh she just understood it so we all spoke English in house. And how did you learn

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:36.040
to speak Welsh? Well by being among the Welsh people. I really never was very good at speaking

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:43.880
Welsh but I understood everything they said but yet I sang in Welsh and our choirs are all Welsh.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.400
Could you say a few words for us in Welsh now then? Well I should say siad ach i hiddu.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.880
Pa' i aith o chi'n siarad yn yr ysgol?

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.880
Spanish.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.880
A chi'n cael eich dysgu trwy'r iaith ysbeineg?

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:00.880
O'r ddraed inni.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.880
Y dim Cymraeg o gwbl?

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.720
Na'r Cymraeg o gwbl.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.720
Athro ysbeineg oedd gyda chi felly neu Cymro oedd yr Athro?

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:15.720
Mi oedd yn un Cymro arllall yn Sbaenid. Edward o'r temps aldereti.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.720
A beth oedd enw'r Cymro?

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:26.720
Yes that's it. An Athro Cymraeg oedd Aro Jones. Well Edward o'r temps aldereti he was the head

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:34.560
teacher. Aro Jones was like under him you see. And so Aldereti said that we would have to

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.240
speak Spanish and play Spanish and everything when we were in the grounds, while we were

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.760
in the grounds. So we used to play, now one thing we used to play, there were two rows

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:53.760
of us girls like this. And the one would come and say, o we bwendisus senorita, tra la

00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:04.800
la la la la la. And then we'd go and say, ke keria sus senorita? Mantantirulirula,

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:14.680
yo keria una de sus ijas. Tra la la la la la. Then they'd say, kual de elias keria usted?

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:21.680
Jo keria a Maria. Tra la la la la la la. That's how we played.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.240
Very good. Did you play any games in Welsh at all?

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:34.840
No I can't remember ever playing anything in Welsh. No. You see we went and out the

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:40.680
teacher told us while in the grounds it was all Spanish. Didn't want anything else. See?

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:46.280
Although you had to speak Spanish in school, you spoke Welsh in the church.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:53.280
Well the services, I tell you we had English services in our church in the morning for

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.960
those that didn't understand the Welsh. I see.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:04.080
And then at night it was a Welsh service. Of course there were some Englishmen living

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:11.280
in Traleo too you see. And one man's name was Mr. Theobald. Well he was a real Englishman.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.880
He had a store there. Well he used to come to our church. Well he wouldn't come if he

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:22.880
couldn't understand it. So they had English in the morning and then Welsh service at night.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:30.800
Yes. And did you attend both services usually? Oh yeah. Three times a day they sent a school

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:38.800
at two o'clock from two to four. Come home and of course mum would be home. She'd have

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:45.800
our tea ready. And after tea we were back in church at six o'clock. How far away from

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:51.320
the church did he live? Oh well no distance from the church. No. No. Why did your father

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:58.320
decide to leave Patagonia? Well he didn't want for one thing for his daughter to move

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:07.800
to Maria Spaniard. I see. And the other was that the boys when they become the age of

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:15.640
eighteen they would enrol them into the army. And father didn't want that either. He said

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:25.320
I wouldn't mind if it was just the British or the Americans but not for the Spanish army.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:32.320
And were there any other reasons? Yes. A father was one of the first ones going into the

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:40.520
valley and he was promised a piece of land. I don't remember now how large but it was

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:47.520
quite a farm. Was this in Chiboot? Yes in Chiboot. And he was promised land and he never

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:54.840
got. Well before we left Patagonia we were in the village of Patagonia. And we were in

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.240
the village of Patagonia. We had some friends in the Spanish army and one was the commander

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:04.840
of the barracks. Great friend of ours. Was he a Spaniard? Yes he was a Spaniard. He came

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:11.840
to see us and he said Mr Jones why are you leaving our beautiful country? Well father

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:21.240
said one thing he said I never got the land that they promised me. Oh well he would see

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:29.240
about that. But then it was too late because they arranged to come to Canada by that time.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:39.760
Yes father made it in mind to come to Canada. I was fifteen years old about two days after

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:51.040
we got started for Liverpool on board. And how long did it take you to get to Liverpool?

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:58.240
It took us a month. And were the conditions bad on the boat? No they were very good really.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:03.560
They were very pleasant you know. When of course when they come to the equator they

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.840
had to put canvas all over the top of the boat. It was so hot. But otherwise it was

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:15.840
just fine. My sister was only nine months old and she started to learn to walk on board

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:22.840
and walk as well as she could because she'd tumbled down on the boat you know swinging.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:29.840
When you got to Liverpool what happened? Well when we got to Liverpool we had the three

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:37.080
days to stay in Liverpool. But father wanted to go and see his sister living eight miles

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:45.080
out to Liverpool. So we spent one night at my aunt's and then we went across to Birkenhead

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:54.800
to see my father's brother living over there. And then we came back again to Liverpool in

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:06.280
time to catch the boat for Canada. And we were back. And we were back to the boat. And

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:14.640
we had to wait around until twelve o'clock that night and the train would be going east.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:23.840
We got as far as Winnipeg. I believe it. No we got as far as Winnipeg. But on the way

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:32.200
before landing in Winnipeg there was a little baby girl that had died. And they stopped

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:39.280
off there to bury her in Ottawa. Then between Ottawa and Winnipeg there was a little girl

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:50.240
born on the train. Yes the father and the mother's name was William Thomas. And the

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:58.640
daughter, well she did live there in Victoria. Whether she's there now I don't know.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:06.640
Now did you bring with you from South America any of your possessions? Oh yes. Yes. My mother

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:17.520
brought a sewing machine. A hand sewing machine. And of course the clock. You have the clock

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:26.800
here now? Yes we have the clock here now. And where was it made? It was really in the

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:36.120
UK in England. But it was made for a company in Chubut. Fabricado para Juan Iyichos. And

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:45.600
what is the name? Buenos Aires. Yes the people had quite a hard time when they first came

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:51.960
out of Canada. They weren't prepared for the severe winters. We thought we were bringing

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:58.520
good warm coats out from Patagonia. But there were only summer coats compared to the ones

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:05.520
they used in Canada. Where exactly did you settle then in Canada? Well we settled 17

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:13.880
miles out of Salkoos. It was named Llewellyn Settlement. Even to this day it's called Llewellyn

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:21.560
Settlement. That was one settlement. There was another settlement a little bit east of

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:28.560
the settlement. And it was called Atwater. Still called Atwater. And did your father

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:35.800
farm the land? Yes. Then father took up this land and he farmed. Until after the world

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:44.420
war because he was growing a lot of grain that time and he was able to sell it at a

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:51.420
good price because of the war. What did you do when you first came out to Saskatchewan?

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:58.560
I really didn't do anything. Did you help on the farm? Well yes of course I had to

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:08.480
help on the farm. Especially when dad cut in the grain and he only had a knox team and

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:15.480
they went fast enough so I had to walk near them to give them a poke every once in a while

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:23.180
to make them go a little faster to run the binder. And what about your husband? When

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:29.620
did you meet your husband? Oh well that's quite a different story. It seems that he

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:35.380
had been in when he was in Montana and he'd come over to see his uncle, the man that brought

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:42.380
him out from Wales. And he found out that there was quite a colony and so he couldn't

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:49.580
find the post office, well in post office he wanted to find it. So the first house he

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:56.580
came to from his uncle's was our house. And of course he got off there and of course he

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:06.060
asked mom the directions to the post office. Well he stayed for a little while. I wasn't

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:11.860
home at the time but he stayed for a little while and when I got home he was a bronco

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:19.020
tied right to the doorknob almost and I couldn't get in because of this awful animal that was

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:26.020
tied there. And I went into the house there and saw this little fellow, cowboy hat, high

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:33.020
heeled shoes, boots you know. Well my first, my first idea was him I thought, my he's a

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:40.900
funny looking little fellow. However it seems that he was a very nice little fellow. And

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:48.260
he'd, I don't know whether he had any ideas about me or not, I don't know. But he did

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:55.260
come back again and settled just in the next farm to us. Well his partner left him so he

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:05.020
was all alone there. Father went down there one day to see this bachelor and so he said

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:09.220
to him, well there's no issue living down here all alone, you might as well come and

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:16.260
live with us. That's how I met my husband. Help it to be. And when you married him did

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:25.380
you move back to his farm? No, no it wasn't his farm really, he only rented it. He rented

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:32.380
it from a man called Coslet Thomas. Another Welshman? Another Welshman, yes. Because he'd

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:39.260
gone into town, into the little town of Bangor to open a store. That was his work in South

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:46.260
America, store keeper. Coslet Thomas? Yes Coslet Thomas, yes. And what about the Welsh

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:55.220
community in Saskatchewan? Did you find that you all met together and spoke Welsh to each

00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:02.380
other? Oh yes, we had Welsh services and choirs, choirs worth listening to. Welsh choirs. Yes,

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:12.460
we did. We had, we're just real Welsh colony. Did you always sing in Welsh in the choir?

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:19.740
Yes, yes I always sang in Welsh. Well nearly I don't think we ever did sing English, we

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:27.460
all sang Welsh you know. Can you remember any of the songs that you would have sung?

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:33.460
I'll put some of them.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:54.460
When did you leave the Welsh community in Saskatchewan? In 1907, I went to Maple Creek, Saskatchewan.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:19:02.460
We lived there for some time. Why did you leave? Well because my husband, he was more

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:08.180
western than anything else, he'd been used to cowboying you see. And he wanted to get

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:15.180
back to that kind of work. What did you think of Wales when you first visited it in 1963?

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:22.180
Oh I loved it. Yes it was very nice. First I went to Holywell and then they took me all

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:30.180
around through Carnarvon Sheer and all over and then I went to Carnarvon Castle and many

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:39.860
other places before I left. From there I went to London. And even though that was your first

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:49.180
visit after living overseas for so many years, do you still feel that you are Welsh? Well

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:56.900
very much so. Very much so. That's one thing that's in my blood. Why is this? Well I don't

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:02.420
know because I was in a Welsh colony all my life you see. Although like I said I didn't

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:07.500
speak it very much. I'd understood it. They couldn't say anything about me in Welsh. I

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:14.500
don't understand. No it's, well I don't know, I just feel very Welsh to tell you the truth.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:21.700
They say well I'm Welsh. And some will say well you have the accent. Well I didn't know

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:28.700
I had the accent but when I hear it I can see. Yes then I met our minister here. His

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:36.060
name is Mr Edwards, Dr Edwards really. And when he came here to visit me I said well

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:44.100
I said you have a Welsh name. He said yes he said it is a Welsh name. He said, he said

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:51.500
I was born in Ireland and my mother was Scottish. Well I said you know you were born in a barn,

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:58.620
you're not a horse. Well of course according to all I was taught in my life you are what

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:05.900
your father is, not what your mother is. And his mother was Irish? No Scottish. And his

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:14.060
father? Well it was Welsh descent you see, born in Ireland. Ah ha. Yes.
