00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.200
This video is to show an example, a selection of events that occurred across the British Empire in 1919.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:20.200
One major event which still has ongoing consequences is in Ireland.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:31.400
Now, in the 1918 general election, Sinn Fein won a large number of seats in that election.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:39.400
In accordance with its manifesto, it chose not to use those seats in parliament in London,

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:46.400
and also it chose not to receive salary, and still that is the case.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:01:00.600
But on the 21st of January 1919, Sinn Fein members created Dail Aeron, which met at the mansion house in Dublin.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:10.600
It was intended to be the first complete step towards an independent Irish Republic.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.800
That same day, the first shots of the Anglo-Irish war were...

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.800
...happened.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.800
Two Royal Irish constabularymen were killed in an ambush at Solohead Beg in Tipperary.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:37.800
In British Guyana, the trade union movement finally moved towards being legal.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Herbert Crishlow, the father of trade unionism, Guyana, and the leader of the British Guyana trade union,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
these are his quotes.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
January 21st 1919, we acted to start a trade union.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
He means a legal trade union.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Charge an entrance fee and get the help of the unionists in England.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
It was a very good idea.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:12.200
A hundred of people paid an entrance fee on the spot, and the British Guyana trade union was started.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.200
It had taken 14 years.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.200
Men on the waterfronts, the carpenters, shop assistants and others,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.200
seen they could gain by it, began to join the union.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.200
On April 5th 1919, I called a mass meeting for the eight hour day.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.200
I was arrested.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.400
Because I gave out a hand bill, we'll a verse from the Marseillaise, and was charged with sedition.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.400
The prosecutor said it would have been all right if I had quoted the whole thing,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.400
but I had chosen two lines which were a call to arms.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.400
However, the charge was dropped.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:03:01.400
Between then and January 1st 1920, we gathered 13,000 members and Â£59,700 in the bank.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:13.400
In Trinidad, as across the Caribbean, merchants increased their prices immediately what was declared.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.400
There was no immediate need for them to do so.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.400
However, they did.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.400
The consequences of this, of course, for the working classes who were already at full stretch,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.400
was times got even harder.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:40.600
Even more so because their wages did not rise, even though productivity did rise under demands from government.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.600
There were strikes in 1917 by the oil workers,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:53.600
and then in 1919 by rail workers, stevedores, sweepers, sugar and dock workers.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.800
South Africa is always a case in point.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.800
In 1910, of course, the South African Union, the government,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.800
introduced legislation disenfranchising Coloureds, Indians and Africans.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.800
Mahatma Gandhi led a passive resistance campaign that started in 1911.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.800
But that wasn't the only form of resistance.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Two examples from 1919.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
70,000 African miners went on strike at the Witsberrand.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
The strike was highly disciplined and organised and alarmed the government

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
who threw police cordons around each of the compounds,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
preventing coordination of demands and action.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.920
Troops broke through the workers' barricades and, with bainiks and

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.040
bainiks fixed, killed three and wounded 40.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:00.040
Police and armed white civilians also attacked a meeting of solidarity with the striking miners,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.040
killing eight and wounding 80.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:12.040
In Cape Town, the first South African Indian Conference was convened by the Cape British Indian Council.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:23.160
That conference resolved to agitate for full civil rights and to resort to civil resistance until those rights were granted.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:36.160
In Egypt, on 8 March 1919, the British authorities arrested populist leader Saad Zaghloul, exiling him to Malta.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.160
That event triggered the Egyptian Revolution of 1919.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:52.280
In India, one of the most shameful episodes in British Empire history,

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:59.280
the Jallinwala Bagh Massacre, also known as the Amritsar Massacre,

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:06.280
took place on 13 April 1919, when troops of the British Army,

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.400
including Gurkhas, under the command of Acting Brigadier General Reginald Dyer,

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:19.400
fired rifles into a crowd of unarmed Indian civilians who had gathered in Amritsar in the Punjab.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:28.400
The civilians had assembled for a peaceful protest to condemn the arrest and deportation of two national leaders,

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:37.520
Sacha Pal and Safuddin Kichlu, but also to honour the Sikh Festival of Basaki.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.520
Over 370 died.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:53.520
In China, and I should explain that China was one of the allied nations, not one of the big ones, during World War I.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.640
It was also present during the Treaty of Versailles.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:08.640
One of the reasons that the British had been able to persuade China to be involved

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:19.640
was that they had promised that all Chinese territories taken by Germany would be returned to China.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.640
They reneged on that promise.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:29.760
And in the worst way possible, because they gave those territories to Japan.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:36.760
The May the 4th Movement was an anti-imperialistic cultural and political movement

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:42.760
which grew out of student protests in Beijing on 4 May 1919.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:49.760
The students were protesting against the Chinese government's weak response to the Treaty of Versailles,

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.880
especially them allowing Japan to retain territories in Shandong.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:00.880
The atmosphere and political mood that emerged around 1919

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:08.880
are at the centre of a set of ideas that have shaped Chinese momentous 20th century,

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.880
according to Rana Mehta, the Oxford University historian.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:23.000
It's also true that that shaped thinking in a way that was fundamental to a future communist path.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Canada, June the 21st 1919, in what's called Bloody Saturday,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
it was the Winnipeg General Strike,

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:44.120
and the Royal Northwest Mountie Police fired a volley of bullets into a crowd of unemployed war veterans,

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.120
killing two.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:53.120
In Australia, there were a series of riots that had been occurring,

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:58.120
which were called the Red Flag Riots.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:07.240
And in Brisbane, the most notable of them occurred.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:17.240
Now the Red Flag Riots were in objection to an extension of the War Precautions Act,

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.240
which prohibited the flying of red flags,

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.240
which are considered to be a symbol of Bolshevism,

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.240
but also a symbol of the Trade Union Movement.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:33.360
And following the arrest of one of the trade unions figureheads,

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.360
Peter Siminoff, in January 1919,

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:42.360
those demonstrations against the Red Flag Ban increased.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.360
And on the afternoon of the 23rd of March 1919,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.360
there was a demonstration against the War Precautions Act,

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:56.480
about 400 people who were marching from the trades hall.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.480
This raised objections by returning soldiers.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.480
And the following night, a crowd of 7,000 to 8,000 people, primarily soldiers,

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.480
tried to attack the trades hall.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:14.480
They were held back by the police, but 100 men received police bayonet wounds.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.480
The fighting lasted for two hours,

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.600
and in the end, 14 to 19 police officers were injured,

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.600
three police horses were shot, one died,

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.600
and 19 of the injured ex-servicemen had to be evacuated by ambulance.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:37.600
As I said, not all nations wanted to be in World War I.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:45.600
Ceylon, certainly the Senolis, were not in support of World War I,

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.720
but they had no choice.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:56.720
So what World War I did was drive the forces of nationalism in Ceylon.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:04.720
When the British arrested the prominent Senolis leaders

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:11.720
during what was a minor communal riot, it provoked widespread opposition.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.840
In 1919, leaders of all communities,

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:21.840
feigning a need for a common platform from which to voice a nationalist viewpoint,

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.840
came together to form the Ceylon National Congress,

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:31.840
which united Senolis and Tamil organisations for the first time.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.840
The non-white British Empire was taken into World War I,

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.840
as I've said, by the British government.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.960
Some places objected, and others, like the Caribbean,

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.960
felt it was their duty to act in support of Britain.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.960
However, in order to supply the war effort,

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.960
their own standard of living dropped dramatically,

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:56.960
and legislation was introduced to stop sedition or demonstrations.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.960
What we've provided are just a few examples of events across the Empire.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:07.960
As we move forward, we will provide a closer in-depth look

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.080
at individual countries and individual events.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.080
My name is Jamie Baker, this is HDA Cardiff,

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:22.080
and it's the Racial Riot Project Wales 1919, funded by Heritage Lottery.
