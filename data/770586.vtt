00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Roeddwn i'n mynd i fod yn fwyaf o'r ddwylo ffyrdd.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Roeddwn i'n mynd i ffyrdd o'r ddwylo ffyrdd i'r camp Iftynghyl.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Roeddwn i'n mynd i ffyrdd o'r ddwylo ffyrdd pan oeddwn i'n mynd i.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Ie.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Felly, nid oedd ymddygiad.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Roedd fy marn i'n gwybod bod angen i'w ddod o'r ddwylo oherwydd nad oedd yn gwneud hynny'n gael gwerth.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Mae'n ddiforol mewn amser i'w gwneud hynny'n gael gwerth.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Felly roeddwn i'n gwybod amgylcheddau,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
a'r unrhyw beth yma oedd y camp Iftynghyl

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
sydd wedi'i ddyddio ar ôl y ddwylo,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
a oedd angen i'r ddwylo yn y ddwylo.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Rwy'n gwybod bod amgylcheddau a'r marn i'n gael gwerth,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
ac roedd nhw'n cael gwerth ar y ddwylo ymlaen at 7 Tunnel Junction.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Felly, roeddwn i'n mynd i'r hud Nysan,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
a dyna lle roedd fy marn i'n gwybod yn 1949.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Yn ystod ymlaen,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
roeddwn yn mynd i'r hud ymlaen,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
y hud yma o'r ddwylo,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
a'i gael ei gysylltu ei hun,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
felly roeddwn yn dda i ddod i'r ddwylo ymlaen,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
ar y ddwylo ymlaen,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
a'r hynny'n bwysig.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Felly, beth yma o'r rhyw fath o'r hud yma?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Wel, roeddwn wedi mynd o'r ddwylo ymlaen,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
i'r rhan bach.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Roedd fy marn i'n gael ymlaen

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
yn ystod y ddwylo ymlaen,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
gyda'r ddwylo ymlaen,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
i wneud y rhan bach ymlaen mwyaf,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
a hefyd oherwydd ei fod yn gallu

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
i'n gallu startio ychwanegwyr yn y ddwylo.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Roeddwn yn eich hun yn ymwneud,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
ond y gweithwyr ddim yn ychwanegwyr ei wneud hynny.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Felly, yn y hud, roedd hi wedi cael boxiau

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
a phethau fel barau o'r gwyb,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
a chlwbau a phethau a phethau

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
ac mae'n bwysig bod pobl yn dod yn ystod

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
a dweud, a oes gennych chi unrhyw beth?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Felly roedd hi'n bwysig ei wneud hynny,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
ond y ddwylo ymlaen nid oes rhywbeth,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
ond unrhyw bach ymlaen.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Felly roedd y ddwylo ymlaen.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Yna roedd y goryddor llwybr

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
i'r ddwylo ar y ddwylo ymlaen,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
sy'n cael ei ddwylo fel ychwanegwyr,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
a byddai'n rhan bach.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Dwi ddim yn erbyn hynny'n dda iawn.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Dwi'n gwybod bod yna ddwylo nesaf.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Mae'n dda, mae'n dda,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
ond dwi ddim yn erbyn beth yma.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Ond dwi ddim yn erbyn beth yma

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
oherwydd ydym wedi'i ddod yn y ddwylo ymlaen.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Mae'r ddau i'r ddwylo yma,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
a'r radiu, a'r sofr, a'r cyffredin.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Ac yn ystod yna,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
roedd y ddwy ddwylo ar y goryddor.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Felly roedd fy marn i'n cael un,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
a phan a phan oedd yna.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Roedd hi'n un?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Do you remember feeling cold?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Yes, it wasn't warm, no, in a hut.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
We had a black-lead grate,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
so the fire had to be lit behind the grill every day,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and there was a big black-leaded oven at the side of it,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
which you could bake in.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I don't know if my mother ever did.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
It was quite primitive living really,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
but I didn't know any different,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
so I was perfectly happy.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
My sister did push me.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
We had to bath in a tin bath in front of this fireplace,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and my mother had the bath out,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and I got out of the bath.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
My sister was ready to get in,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and she shoved me for some reason,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and I sat on the fire,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
on the black-leaded thing.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So I had the most terrible burn

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
on my bottom and the top of my leg,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
so I know I had to go to hospital

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and have it dressed and all sorts of things,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and that's not so easy in those days

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
because nobody had a car to take you to a hospital.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Where was the hospital?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
The hospital was the cottage hospital in Chepstow,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and I think, I'm not sure whether the museum is there now.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Yeah, it's become the museum.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Yes, and that used to be the hospital,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and I was in there when I was three or four

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
to have my tonsils out.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I remember my mother took me in,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and I had my own nightie on.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I had the operation in my nightie,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and when she came to fetch me a week later,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
no visitors allowed because I was a child

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and it would upset me.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So I was in a week, and when she came in,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I still had this bloody nightie on

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
from where they take the tonsils out.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
But I do remember being on a lady's ward,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and there was one very nice old lady

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that looked after me,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and she gave me a big bag of quality type sweets,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
which was a great luxury when I went home.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I remember another lady in one of the corner beds,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and she was shrieking for the nurse all the time,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
which I didn't quite understand what was going on.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
It didn't seem to do me any harm.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
How long did you actually live in these huts?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Till I was seven.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
You were seven.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Yes, so we'd moved there in 1948.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
My sister was born in 1949.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
We moved to Caldecott in 1954,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and that's when the houses were built

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
in Caldecott and Port Scuwet.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And I think we could choose which place we went to,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
but Dad chose Caldecott

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
because it was near a seven-tonne junction,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
and he used to ride his bike to work,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
so it was a quicker journey.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Where did you go to school then,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
once you came to Caldecott?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Obviously I went to Port Scuwet School

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
when we were at the camp,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and I had to go on the bus to that

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
with all the other children.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
It was too far to walk.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And then when we moved to Caldecott,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
my first school was Church Road School,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
which was the only school in Caldecott then.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
But I wasn't there very long

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
because that was April 54.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
The following year, I think,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I'm pretty certain that in 1955

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
the Green Lane School was open

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
because I have a photo

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
of the school class of 1955 taken there.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
I was looking at it the other day,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
so it must have been opened by 55.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
That, of course, is now gone

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and a brand new one in its place.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
But we were the first wave.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And that became junior then,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and the old Church Road School became infants.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
But there were no other schools

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
until the Comprehensive was built.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Children from here went to Rogget

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
for secondary education

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
or Larkfield for grammar school.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And you went to?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
I went to Larkfield, yes.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
So you've seen quite a lot of changes really.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
A huge amount of changes, yes.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
It's changed from a fairly small village

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
into not a large town,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
but a small town with a lot of housing.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Huge housing estates.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Do you remember the impact?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Do you remember your parents talking about it?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Of the changes that were coming with it?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Not really, because I think it all developed so gradually.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
When we moved into Longcroft Road,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Caerwmau Road was still being finished off.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
The houses were there,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
but they were still being finished.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Where the clinic is in Caerwmau Road,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
that was the centre for the builders

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
to put all their buildings,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
so it had water and railings all around it.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
They kept all the building materials and stuff in there

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
while they were building the rest of the houses.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000
So we really were the first wave of newcomers to Caldecott.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
So we were, a lot of the photos in this photos of old Caldecott book,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I remember that,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
it still was very much a rural place, a village,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
where Margaret's Way is,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
was a field with a big pond in,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
and we used to go and catch tadpoles and frogspawn in that.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Dewstow, we used to go and explore the quarry.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Well, I'm not quite sure how that's all worked out,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
what was, but there's all houses there now anyway.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
So do you remember anything about the schools,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
what they were like?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Did you have plaque boards?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Did you have pen and ink?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Any of those details?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Yeah, I think when I first, yeah, when I was in junior school,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
I think each desk had an inkwell in it,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and we had the pen you dipped in the inkwell.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
I think so.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And blackboards and chalk, yes.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
We had one teacher that I thought was really good fun

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
and always made jokes with him and all the rest of it,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and one day I drew his picture on the board

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and put Mr Hodges, which wasn't like me

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
because I was a very good little girl,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and he made me stand on the chair

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
with my hands on my head after school.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So all the kids told my mother,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Mary's having to stand on the chair with her hands on her head,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
and she thought it was hilarious.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
She thought it was really funny because, you know,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
I never usually put a foot wrong.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Yeah.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
So he wasn't amused at that, so that taught me a lesson.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Yeah.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Do you remember any activities in the school?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Did you have...

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Obviously you had the reading, writing and arithmetic.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Yes.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Like we all did.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
By the time I was there, we did a lot of practice for the 11+.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Lots of intelligence tests and English tests and mental arithmetic,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and we did those a lot,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
so that by the time you got to the 11+,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
you were well versed in what you had to do.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I remember concerts because I remember doing choral speaking

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
when I was in the top class, I think,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and we had to say, hile bellox,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
there was a boy whose name was Jim,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
about Jim being eaten by the lion,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and I still remember that to this day.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
I've often said it at different things,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and that was when I was 10 or 11.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Yeah, so that was nice.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And of course we had sports days.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And where were the sports?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Just in the school.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
I remember being in the sack race,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and I remember being in the thread the needle race.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
The trouble was I was really good in all the heats,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
but when it came to the actual day, everything went wrong.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
I think I was probably last in everything.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I'm not really a sporty person.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Better at gymnastics.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
So you passed the 11+.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
I passed the 11+, yeah.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
I went to Larkfield.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And did you get there from Cardicot?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
On the bus, the ordinary service bus, yes.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
We were issued with season tickets by the County Council,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and I guess there were maybe a dozen of us from Cardicot.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Did you start noticing changes in the village by then?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Transport was improving, or perhaps?

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Maybe you felt you had a car or something?

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
No, we never had a car really.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
I did buy a car, which looked a bit like a hearse.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
He bought it for £10.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
It was a really ancient thing,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
but he wanted to learn to drive on it.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
But wherever he went, we mostly ended up pushing it back.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
So he had to take some passengers in order for it to be pushed back afterwards.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And he used to keep it on the green down opposite our house,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
and he'd sit in and practise changing gears and things.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
So that was quite a joke for a while.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
But he did pass his test eventually,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
and mum and dad belonged to the Civil Defence in the 60s,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and they used to drive ambulances on exercise.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Well, mum didn't drive an ambulance, but dad did, and my aunt.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
I'm just thinking of Cardicot.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000
One of the ladies we spoke to talked about cattle being driven through the centre of Cardicot.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
That isn't something I remember, whether that was before my time, but I don't remember that.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
What I remember going through Cardicot is the shale lorries for the steelworks being built.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And of course, the steelworks was responsible for a bigger increase in housing again,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
and we had lots of people from the valleys.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And some of the friends I have that I've known since I was in the 60s are still here,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
but they first came from Ebbw Vale of that area with the steelworks.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
But there was a lot of complaints about the shale lorries,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
because Cardicot was still a village, and all this going through was very dangerous.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
And when you think what we have now, it was quite mild really.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Nothing like the great big lorries we get now. It's so enormous.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So I wonder where those shale lorries were coming from.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:11.000
No, I'm not sure. I tend to think of them, well, they'd have had to go both ways,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000
they were going in the Chepstow direction, so I'm not sure whether there was anything that way.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
It does suggest quarries on the Chepstow side.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Yeah.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Had they been going Newport way, of course, they wouldn't have come through Cardicot anyway,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
so it has to be that way.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
We didn't have the bypass road then, so they'd have had to go right through the village,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
because none of Jubilee Way and all those were built,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and they weren't the quality or the size of the roads that they are now, they were much more lanes.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
I'm sort of changing in demographics in a way.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
The accents change, don't they?

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Yes.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
You hear the Welsh accent.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Yes, a bit more Welsh in it.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
My accent, people have often been puzzled by it,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
because it's got a touch of Bristol, a touch of Gloucester and a touch of Welsh.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
So it's probably just a Monmouthshire accent.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And English was taught at school, just English?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Yes, yes, I never spoke Welsh.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
I think my dad's granny used to speak Welsh.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
He said if she wasn't speaking Welsh, she was speaking in tongues,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
because she was a spiritualist, but he thinks it was Welsh.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
She lived in Pontypool.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
So presumably she was a Welsh speaker.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Let's grow you up then.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Good luck.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
I was going to say, we did about the games last time, didn't we?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
The sort of children's games and the entertainment we did.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
I said we did hopscotch and just drew on the road,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
because there wasn't much cars going by then, so we didn't get much interrupted.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Of course, the skipping ropes were an important part,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000
or doing things with a ball, throwing a ball about, hide and seek.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:14.000
We also had the Saturday cinema in the YMCA hut on Church Road,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:22.000
and that was run by the North family, who were very devout Pentecostals.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
So they used to put on these cinema shows on a Saturday.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
I think it might have been six months to go in.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
I saw all sorts of really good films, and it had the seating,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
but the back few rows were bus seats,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
and all the courting couples sat on the bus seats at the back.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
So I always aspired to get into these bus seats.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.000
When I was engaged years later, my fiancée and I went to see South Pacific in that cinema,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
and we sat in the bus seats at the back.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
So I didn't get there in the end.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
But Mr North, he'd say,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
now there'll be a free ice lolly next week if you bring a friend,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
or bring a friend and you'll get free ice lollies,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
the walls ice lollies that were sort of triangular shaped.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Do you remember those long triangle things?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
And then in the interval between the films, they'd have us singing choruses.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
So we'd be singing,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And all these kids would be singing away, and they'd put the words up on the screen.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000
So really, it was a great outreach into the community for the church.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
But nobody seemed to mind nowadays, they'd probably get lynched,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
or forbidden to do it at the very least.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
How much did that cost?

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
I think it was £10,000.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000
I think it was £6 to go in,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
because I used to get a shill in a week pocket money,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
which of course is £0.05 now.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
So if I went to the cinema, it was a bit extravagant,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
because I'd pay £6 to go in,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
and then I'd get some sweets for thruppants,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
and then I'd have thruppants left for the rest of the week.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Yeah, that's right.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
We used to go into Mrs Dally's sweet shop on the cross,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
because the cross then was a big roundabout, Cardicot Cross.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
And Dally's had a little cottage on the corner,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
the first you would come to on your left as you look at Newport Road.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
And it had like a stable door to it,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
so when she opened the shop, she'd just open the top half.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:48.000
If she heard the bell go, she'd come out of her parlour to serve us,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
and she got very impatient if you were too long choosing.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
So we used to sort of hang over this door, seeing what she had on offer.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Sorry, I'm doing my best.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
To see what was going on.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
So do you remember any of the films that you saw?

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
I remember seeing Houdini.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
That made a big impression on me,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
because he got drowned in the end when he couldn't get out of his trappings.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
So I remember that.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
I remember lots and lots of cowboy films,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
and I remember one where a cowboy had been scalped,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
and he had this bright red head, and he'd been tied to his horse and came back.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
I don't know what film it was,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
but it made a big impression on me, because it was a bit horrible.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:44.000
But I can't think what else I saw other than South Pacific, when I was much older.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
So did you do any outings?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
You went on holiday with your parents?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Yes, because Dad worked on the railway, we used to get free passes.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
So I know we went over to Ireland on the ship the one day, crossed over there.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
We didn't have cabins, we slept overnight in the hall, whatever it is, the Lenge.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
So we'd enjoyed that, I think.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
We went to Belfast, and we went up to Aberdeen,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:17.000
and stayed with bed and breakfast with a Mrs Berry as the landlady.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
What I do remember about a lot of holidays was it was often raining,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
but I think that is so if you're holidaying Britain.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
We went to Newquay and Ilfracom quite a bit,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:36.000
and I remember my sister, she was only a baby really, and we were in the sun.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
It was a lovely sunny holiday, which was probably why my parents weren't armed for it.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Margaret got a blister on her back, which was like a cushion, it was all blister, terrible.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
So they took her to the doctor, and he really wiped the floor with my parents,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
being so careless that they let her get in that state.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
I think that was Ilfracom.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
We used to camp in a tent when we went there.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Then my grandparents moved to London, where my grandad became a ticket collector.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000
We used to have holidays with them in London then, which was wonderful.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000
My mother would put me on in Newport, and my gran would meet us in London.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
That was quite an adventure.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
So Cardiff wasn't just a complete world then?

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
No, no, that's right.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
I think with Dad having these free passes, we did go to a lot of different places,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
usually only for a week at a time.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
We went up to New Brighton, saw something with Liverpool.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
We did very well, really.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Can I ask about when you went to the secondary school, to the grammar school, Larkfield?

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Did you study Welsh? Was that part of the curriculum?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000
No, it wasn't then. It wasn't until the Welsh Language Act.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
I don't know whether that was after the referendum,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:19.000
or whether it was when we became the new counties in 1996.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:26.000
But then the Act was passed that Welsh had to be taught in all of Monmouthshire schools.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Chepstow and Monmouth both tried to opt out, and they wouldn't let them,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.000
because they said they were so Anglicised, and a lot of their pupils came from over the border.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
But no, they have to teach it.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Of course, we've got more Welsh medium schools now anyway, haven't we?

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Yes.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
So what were the subjects that you did do that you remember?

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.000
English Language and Literature, French, Latin.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
I think I might have started Latin in the second year.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.000
History and Geography and General Science, Maths of course.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
PE and Games.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
And Needlework and Cookery.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
And then that changed as you went through the school.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:24.000
I think in the second year you could do Latin or Cookery, and I chose Latin.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:32.000
And then it was Physics, Art or Needlework when you got to the third form, something like that.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
I chose Needlework to do for GCE.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
And the sciences, I chose Geology.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:49.000
So I never really did Chemistry or Physics or Biology as separate subjects, only in the general sciences.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000
And then when I got to A levels, I did English-French and History.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
So they were the subjects you liked the best, or you thought you would...?

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Yes, that was what I liked. That was my scene.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
And you went to college after that, didn't you?

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Well, I had applied to university.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
I had been wondering about the library, whether I would go and be a librarian.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000
I didn't get my grades as high as I should have done for my first choice, and I decided not to go to Clearing.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
I passed the three, but not the grades I should have got.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000
So I decided that made up my mind, I was going to go to library school instead.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
So I worked for a year and then went to Loughborough for two years.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
That's where you trained to be a librarian.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
I trained to be a librarian.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
And then, not long after that, they made it a degree course.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:52.000
So I did an open university degree in the 80s to sort of keep my qualifications abreast.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
I was also nice to my mum and dad, because all through school my teachers had said,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Oh, Mary will go to university. She's a white, she'll go to university.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
And I didn't, and I felt disappointed with them.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:13.000
So when I did get my open university degree, they came down to the graduation and had a photo of me at last.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000
So you did your degree, your open university degree, as a mature student then?

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Yes.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000
Were you married by then?

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Oh, yes. The children were.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:32.000
When I was doing it, Catherine was five or six because I know she had to do something for school at home.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
And she had to watch something on the telly and she said, I'm going to be mummy doing her city.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Because I used to have to watch television programmes for her, you see.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
She's going to be mummy doing her city.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000
And what subjects did you cover in your open university degree?

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Wel, fe wnaethon i ddegri ym Mhobol, felly roedd y cwrs ym Mhobol.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:04.000
A yna ar y pethau nesaf, fe wnaethon i renauasant a'r ffomio, a Ynglyn 17 oed,

Felly, hynny'n cael gweithio i'r Mhobol, ym Mhobol, gwasanaeth, mwzig, arth, llyfrgell,

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
filosofiaid a phsycologiaeth, mae'r rhai o'r hyn hefyd.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:21.000
Benおspналmış mlwg hynny elderall dim oedd yn tenbyr i'i engharاشu,

A fe wnaeth un tŷr, ym Mawgrit Nicholas,

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.360
Yn ogystal â hyn,

A fe wnaethom i fynd i ddod.

Nid oedd yn ffyrdd gwahanol,

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.360
ond fe wnaethom i ddod i wneud y grwp.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.360
Felly, fe wnaethom yn cael hyn.

A fe wnaethom i,

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.360
yn y gwaith yma,

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.360
fe wnaethom i Gweithdorfa Barth i ddod i fwy.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.360
Mae'n dda'n ddaeth.

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.360
A fe wnaethom i un o'r un o'r un,

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.360

Felly, fe wnaethom i ddod i.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.360
Ond fe wnaethom i Gweithdorfa York,

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.360
a byddai'n dda'n dda'n ddaeth.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.360
Oherwydd, fe wnaethom i ymddygiad ymgyrch,

Roedd yn gweithio ar y sefydliadau y byddwch chi'n treinio,

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.360
a byddwch chi'n gweithio yn y ddod o'r amser hwn?

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.360
Roeddwn i'n gweithio ar y sefydliad,

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.360
yn y pwynt,

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.360
felly,

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.360
roedd hynny'n gweithio fel y byddwn nhw'n angen.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.360
Rwy'n credu bodwn i wedi'i gweithio

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.360
ar y pwynt yma.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.360
Roeddwn i wedi'i gweithio

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.360
yn, roeddwn i wedi'i gweithio

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.360
yn y 82,

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.360
ac roeddwn i'n gweithio yn ymddygiad yna.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.360
Roeddwn i wedi'i gweithio

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.360
yn y pwynt yn y 1984.

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.360
Felly, roeddwn i'n mynd i ni o'r

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.360
ymddygiad o'r Llyfrgell Cardicot,

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.360
a sut yw'n gweithio?

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.360
Felly,

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.360
fel y ddod, roeddwn i'n mynd i'r Llyfrgell Cardicot

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.360
pan oeddais 7.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.360
A pan oeddais,

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.360
oeddais o bryd iawn iawn,

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.360
a'r llyfrgellau oedd yn sgwyr.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.360
Gallwch chi ddod y pwynt o'r ysgol

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.360
a'r pwynt o'r cyfan,

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.360
a'i gael ar y ffamiliau.

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.360
Ond nid oedd yn llwyr

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.360
i'n cymryd fy mod,

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.360
ac yn y ffordd o bwynt.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.360
Roeddwn i'n gobeithio.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.360
Felly, un ddod pan oeddais 9,

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.360
roedd y ffrind wedi'i dweud i mi,

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.360
chi'n gwybod, gallwch i fynd i'r Llyfrgell Cardicot

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.360
a gallwch chi gael bwynt,

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.360
a gallwch chi eu hwyneu a'i gyd-dweud,

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.360
ac pan oeddais, gallwch chi eu hwyneu a'i gyd-dweud a fyddai fwy.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.360
A nid oeddai'n gwybod, un peth.

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.360
Roedd hynny'n dda iawn i'n dda iawn i'n dda,

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:57.360
felly roeddwn i'n mynd i'r Llyfrgell Cardicot

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.360
i ddod o'r hyn sy'n mynd yn y parish.

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:03.360
Y parish yma oedd ym Mhryd yn Churchi.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:07.360
Yn y parish yma,

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.360
maen nhw'n cael y desg,

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.360
a chyfrwyr a'r Llyfrgell Cardicot

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.360
a'r Llyfrgell Cardicot,

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.360
ac roeddwn i'n cael gyd-dweud,

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.360
y peth yma, ym Mhryd Llyfrgell.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.360
Roeddwn i ddim wedi clywed o Mhryd Llyfrgell.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.360
Roeddwn i'n clywed o'r Llyfrgell Cardicot

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.360
yn y cyfnod rhywbeth,

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.360
ac roeddwn i ddim wedi clywed o'r Llyfrgell.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.360
Felly roedd hynny'n bwyto newydd i mi,

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.360
ond roeddwn i'n ddaith iawn,

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.360
roeddwn i'n cael ei gyd-dweud,

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.360
a chael ei gyd-dweud,

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.360
roeddwn i'n cael ei gyd-dweud,

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.360
a roeddwn i'n un o'r Llyfrgell Cardicot

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.360
ym Mhryd Llyfrgell Cardicot

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.360
a'n ddaeth i'n mynd i'r Llyfrgell Cardicot

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.360
Llyfrgell Cardicot

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.360
60 o blynyddoedd yn dda.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.360
Mae'n bwyno'n newid, wrth gwrs,

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.360
nawr.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.360
Roedd y Llyfrgell wedi cael

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.360
ymlaen i gyd-dweud

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.360
oherwydd

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.360
roedd hi'n haws cymdeithas

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.360
a phobl o bobl wedi'i ddefnyddio.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.360
Felly roedd y llyfrgell hefyd yn cael ei gyd-dweud.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.360
Roedd y llyfrgell yma

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.360
yn ymwneud ymlaen

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.360
a'r holl ymwneud

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.360
a'r ymwneud ymlaen

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.360
a'r holl rôl o bobl

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.360
wedi cael ei gyd-dweud oherwydd

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.360
roedd gennym yr ymwneud y system brann

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.360
a'r holl bobl wedi cael ei gyd-dweud

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.360
yn ymwneud ymlaen

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.360
pan oedd gennych chi'r llyfrgell.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.360
Roedd hynny'n cael ei gyd-dweud

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.360
am ddwy o blynyddoedd

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.360
cyn ymlaen i'r newydd

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.360
ymlaen i'r Caldicot College,

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.360
a'r ysgol yn dda, yn eithaf,

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.360
ond rydym yn cael ei gyd-dweud ymlaen

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.360
oherwydd bod y cwbl ymlaen

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.360
yn cael eu gyd-dweud ymlaen.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.360
Roedd hynny'n cael ei gyd-dweud

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.360
yn y cwbl ymlaen i'r Caldicot College.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.360
Mae'n llyfrgell iawn,

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.360
rhan fawr, a'i gael

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.360
gwybodaeth o ddwyloedd gyda'r cwbl,

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.360
a oedd yn ôl ymlaen i'r paris,

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.360
oherwydd cael eu gwybodaeth

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.360
a phwyaf o bwysau

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.360
a

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.360
ymlaen i'r cwbl gyda

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.360
armeidiau.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.360
Mae'r armeidiau armeidiau

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.360
cyd-dweud yn dda,

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.360
ac pan sylwch yn y cwbl,

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.360
mae'r bwysau yn mynd yn

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.360
pfff!

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.360
Mae'n dda!

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.360
Ond roeddwn i'n credu

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.360
bod hynny'n wirioneddol.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.360
Roedd yn dda, mae'n cymryd cymorth

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.360
o ddwyloedd cymorth yn unig,

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.360
nid oeddwn yn unrhyw un.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.360
Roeddwn i'n dweud i fy marn, oeddwn i'n gobeithio

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.360
gyd-dweud ymlaen gyda'r Cwbl,

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.360
mae'n dda, ond roedd

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.360
yn ymlaen i'r cwbl ymlaen

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.360
ac roeddwn i'n credu bod yn newid

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.360
i fod yn aelod,

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.360
roeddwn i'n gweithio bod yn cymorth

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.360
a dwi wedi bod yn aelod,

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.360
ac roeddwn i wedi bod yn hapio i wneud hynny.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.360
Ac wrth gwrs, oedd yna,

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.360
ar ôl y cwbl,

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.360
y cabin ymlaen wedi bod yn cael ei wneud

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.360
ac roedd y Llyfrgell wedi eu cymorth ei hun,

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.360
a'r hyn yn ymlaen,

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.360
sy'n gweld llawer o ffrwyd a llwyd,

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.360
a'r llwybr ymlaen,

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.360
a'r llawer o ffrwyd.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.360
Felly, beth o ddau oedd hynny'n

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.360
arall?

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.360
Beth o ddau oedd hynny'n mynd

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.360
yn ymlaen?

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.360
Dwi ddim yn bwysig,

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.360
yn ystod y scwll,

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.360
y cabin ymlaen

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.360
a dwi wedi ddod yn 1964,

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.360
felly, yw,

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.360
ar ôl 1960,

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.360
yn y ffordd,

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.360
dwi ddim wedi bod yn ymlaen.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.360
Wel, ydych chi'n gweld,

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.360
yn 1964, dwi yn ymwneud

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.360
ar gyfer Llyfrgell ymlaen,

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.360
ac y llyfrgell newydd Carl de Cots

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.360
yn y plan ffyrdd.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.360
Mae'n cael ei ddod,

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.360
ac roedd yn mynd i'w gynnyddio

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.360
y gofnodion o ddwyfnodion un,

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.360
a bydd yn ystod y peth,

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.360
bydd yn ystod y Cymru Monmouth,

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.360
yn gweithio ar y gwynt Cymru.

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.360
Ond nid oes

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.360
yn ymwneud

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.360
yn 1996,

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.360
y Llyfrgell Carl de Cots

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.360
yn ymwneud.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.360
Mae'r Llyfrgell Monmouth

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.360
wedi cael ei ddod yn ymwneud

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.360
ac wedi gwneud y gofnodion un

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.360
o ddwyfnodion un.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.360
Ond yna mae'n

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.360
mewn i'r ddwyfnodion,

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.360
ond roedd yn ymwneud

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.360
yn y peth,

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.360
felly roedd yn bwysig

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.360
i fod yn rhan o

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.360
gweld y Llyfrgell newydd yn mynd i.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.360
A oedd y gofnodion yn ymwneud?

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.360
A oedd y gofnodion yn ymwneud?

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.360
Mae'n rhaid bod wedi bod,

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.360
ond dwi ddim yn erbyn iawn,

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.360
beth oedd ymwneud.

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.360
Rwy'n ennill ymwneud

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.360
oherwydd

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.360
fy mhaid i'n gofnodion i'r mhaid

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.360
un rhan, ac roedd

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.360
fynd i gyrfa'r ddynnu

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.360
a'i ddod yn ystod yr MP

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.360
a roedd yn dweud

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.360
o, roedd i'n dweud o'r Llyfrgell,

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.360
a roedd yn dweud, roeddwn i'n gofnodio

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.360
arno o'r ddwyfnodion.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.360
Ac roeddwn i'n dweud, a'n gwybod, pa fydd yn dda?

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.360
Byddai'n dweud, mae'n dda,

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.360
ac oherwydd, mae'r Llyfrgell

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.360
yma, mae'r Llyfrgell,

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.360
a dweud, mae'n dda,

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.360
ac roedd un o'r staff yn dweud, Mary, dwi'n gwybod, mae gennym un MP

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.360
yn mynd i ddod yn ystod yr MP,

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.360
gallwch chi ddysgu hynny.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.360
Felly, fe wnes i'n gwneud yn

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.360
ystod y ddwyfnodion ym Mhaldicot y ddwyfnodion,

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.360
felly roedd

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.360
yn dweud, roedd yn dweud,

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:11.360
yn ystod yr MP a'r holl ymddygiad,

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.360
ac roeddwn yn dda yn ystod yr ystod yr MP.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.360
A pan roedd yn mynd i'w ddod, roedd yn mynd i'w ddod

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.360
a roedd yn dweud, roedd yn dweud, roedd yn dweud,

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:20.360
Roedd wedi cael Sianna G挥rd i chi yn ystod eraill,

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.360
roedd wedi cael sponsors amdanyfodus

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.360
peidiar everyoneRWC

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.360
Rydym wedi cyändig,

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.360
ac roedd attached.

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:44.860
Roedd hefyd yn driving

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.360
o ffrindiau free programming

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:49.360
ymlaen ymlaen y ffyrdd ymlaen y llyfrgellau.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:53.360
Roeddwn i'n gweithio, sy'n gyfrifol ymlaen,

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:57.360
roeddwn i'n gweithio yn ddwyfnodwr a chyfnogiwr,

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:01.360
a roeddwn i'n gweithio yn ddeall a chyfrifol.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:04.360
Felly roedd yna ddwyfnod, a yna ymlaen y prynciel,

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.360
roedd hynny'n ddwyfnod.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:11.360
Felly roeddwn i'n gweithio arall 8 llyfrgellau gweithio.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.360
Ond roedd rhai o'n gweithio

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.360
yn ddwyfnodol,

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.360
yn ddwyfnodol,

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.360
yn ddwyfnodol,

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.360
oherwydd,

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.360
dwi'n gwybod,

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.360
mae Ann Thomas wedi bod,

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:30.360
ond roedd hi'n gweithio fel asgol ymlaen ym Momet yn ystod yw'r amser.

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:33.360
Felly roedd hi'n gweithio yn y Llyfrgellau Chant.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.360
Mae Ann yn gweithio,

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:38.360
ac roedd hi'n gweithio ar ôl.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.360
Ond rydyn ni'n mynd yn ymlaen yn ymlaen.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.360
Dim ond rann

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:47.320
o gynllun

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.360
pan oedd angen cyfnod safonri?

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.340
A beth rydym wedi'i gan halu ym pain

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:54.360
a'r …

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.360
anaenu honno,

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.360
gwyboda,

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:01.360
felly pam drefnu,

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:05.320
gwneud yn lyf Synfedd不了,

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.360
eisoes creischen.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.360
Mae'n ddysgu.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:12.360
Roeddwn i'n byw yn Shakespeare Drive,

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:15.360
pan oeddwn i'n byw ymlaen i'r holl haws,

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.360
yn Shakespeare Drive nr 1.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.360
Roedd hi'n dda i'r holl haws yn dda iawn,

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.360
roeddwn i'n mynd i'r lwybr,

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.360
ychwanegol, ychwanegol ymlaen.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.360
Roeddwn i'r modcons yn dda,

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.360
roedd hi'n dda i'r gwasgwch ddwyng-tub

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.360
sy'n cael ei ddraeg a'i llwybr,

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:35.360
yn ymwneud â gwneud y wasg.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.360
Roeddwn i'n gwasgwch ddwyng-tub,

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.360
roeddwn i'n gwasg,

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.360
ac roeddwn i'n gwasg,

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.360
yn y ffyrdd o bryd,

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.360
yn y garrig.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.360
Roeddwn i ddim yn gweld y ffryd-ffryd yma,

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:50.360
ond roeddwn i'n gwasgwch ddwyng-tub yn y garrig.

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:53.360
Roeddwn i'n gwasgwch ddwyng-tub.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:57.360
Ac pan oedd fy marn i'n dda,

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.360
roeddwn i'n cael rhan o fwyaf o hyn,

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.360
ac roeddwn i'n cael y cwmpas o ddwyng-tub gyda'r holl haws.

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.360
Roedd yn y pethau yn ystod,

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.360
roedd Princess Anne yn cael ei gwerthu,

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.360
a hynny yna 1973,

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.360
oherwydd fy llawer o ffrwythau o bryd,

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.360
ac rwy'n gwybod bod hi'n mynd i weithio'i hwyst i'r pethau i'w gweld yn y ddwyng-tub hwn.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:19.360
Felly roedd gennych chi am ddwy o fwyaf o gwaith

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.360
yn y gwaith dynol

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.360
y byddwch chi'n gwybod.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.360
Roeddwn i'n cael cwmpas o ddwyng-tub,

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.360
ond roeddwn i'n cael fwyaf o ffrwythau,

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.360
yn y gwaith dynol hefyd.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.360
Ond, oherwydd,

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.360
mae'n gweithio'n gwneud unrhyw gwaith.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.360
Iawn.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.360
A chweithio, yw,

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.360
chweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio,

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:43.360
ffyrdd a chweithio a chweithio a ddwy o ffrwythau.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:47.360
Iawn, ond roedd gennym y prif ddwyng-tub o'r ddwyng-tub,

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.360
yw'r ddwyng-tub,

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:53.360
y bydd ystod y 21 yw.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:57.360
A fy marn oedd a'r broedd yn y ddwyng-tub,

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.360
roedd yn gweithio ar ddwyng-tub,

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.360
felly roedd yn gweithio ar ddwyng-tub ychydig.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:05.360
Ys yna pan roedd y broedd yn y ddwyng-tub?

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.360
Roedd yn y ddwyng-tub,

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.360
dwi'n credu, yn y 70au,

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:13.360
oherwydd roeddwn i'n gweithio'n ddwyng-tub ym 1967,

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:15.360
a roedd yn dda arall y ddwyng-tub,

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.360
y ddwyng-tub ymlaen,

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:21.360
ac mae llawer o'r ddwyng-tub arall y ddwyng-tub yma.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.360
Ond, iawn,

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.360
roedd y cliniadau'r doktor,

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.360
roedd y cliniadau'r doktor yma,

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.360
yna yn Caimau Roedd,

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.360
ond roedd y cliniadau'r doktor yma.

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.360
Roedd yna rhai doktorau yma,

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.360
a gallwch chi weld.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.360
Rwy'n meddwl bod yna cliniadau ymlaen i ffyrdd oherwydd,

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.360
a phan o'r ddwyng-tub arall hefyd.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.360
Ond roedd y cliniadau Greyhill ddim wedi'i gwneud yna.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.360
Ond, wrth gwrs, pan oeddwn i'n pwyll,

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.360
roedd y cliniadau'r doktor yma,

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.360
ar Deep Weir,

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.360
yng Nghymru,

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.360
ymlaen,

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.360
gyda'r baro yn y gwaith,

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.360
roedd yn ymlaen,

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.360
a'r ddwyng-tub oherwydd,

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.360
roedd yn ymlaen,

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.360
i ddysgu'r doktor.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.360
Roedd yna Dr Strong,

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.360
a dwi'n meddwl bod hi'n ei ddod ar unrhyw fath o ddwylo

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.360
dr Wolford Davies,

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.360
a oedd yn dda iawn iawn.

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.360
Roedd Dr Strong

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.360
yn cwmwch chi i fynd

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:17.360
a chydwch chi yn ei lwng,

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.360
neu, yn ogystal â chyfrwch yno,

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.360
a chydwch chi'n mynd i'r ddwylo,

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.360
yn y lles,

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.360
a yna un Christmas,

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.360
fel y pŵer,

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.360
roeddwn i'n cael un calbuncal ar fy marn,

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.360
a byddaf yn llawer yn dda iawn,

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.360
ac roeddwn i wedi bod yn gweithio ar ddwyll Chwistmas,

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.360
a dyna dda i'n mynd i fynd i'r ddwylo,

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.360
i gael ei ddwylo,

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.360
ac roedd Dr Strong wedi ei newid.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.360
Roedd nhw'n nid oedd yn gweithio neu'n eu gweithio,

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.360
neu unrhyw beth yna,

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.360
yn ogystal â chydwch chi,

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.360
roedd nhw'n cael eu gweithio i'r ddwylo'r cyngor,

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.360
yn ogystal â phrofiadau,

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.360
ond rwy'n credu,

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.360
roedd yna ddim yn unrhyw beth o ran

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.360
ei ddwylo yn eu cyngor.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.360
Felly,

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:59.360
byddwn yn cael ymddygiad gwahanol.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.360
Mae'n ddiforol yna,

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.360
fy marn, yn ddiforol o'r marn i fy marn,

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.360
ac y cyfle

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.360
cymorthoedd,

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.360
yn eithaf,

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.360
oherwydd fy marn i ddim wedi'i ddwylo

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.360
pan oeddwn yn ymwneud.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.360
A fy pater nid oedd yn gweithio hynny

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:17.360
yn y ddwylo.

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.360
Rwy'n credu,

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.360
o'r enw gweithio yn Cherrytree,

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:23.360
roedd wedi'i gweithio yn fwy o ddwylo

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.360
gan Jo a rydw i wedi cael,

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.360
ond roedd yn dweud mai ei ddwylo.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.360
Rwy'n credu, oherwydd roedd yn dweud

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.360
mai ei ddwylo'n gweithio'n fwy o ddwylo,

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.360
oherwydd roedd yn dweud,

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.360
roedd yn dweud,

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:37.360
roedd fy fater,

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.360
pan oedd yn ymwneud,

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.360
roedd yn 88 pan oedd yn ymwneud

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.360
yn Cherrytree, a oedd wedi cael dimensiwyr

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.360
ac roedd wedi cael dimensiwyr

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.360
felly roedd yn mynd i fod yn ddaf am ddŵr

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.360
ar gael am gael gael cael gael gael...

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.360
A mae'r fater oedd yn ymwneud?

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.360
Rwy'n credu, yn gwybod,

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.360
roedd yn cael dweud mai ei ddwylo'n edrych arno,

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.360
roedd yn cael dimensiwyr a ffarchion,

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.360
roedden nhw'n gwybod bod yn ddwylo'n unrhyw rhan.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.360
Roedd yn cael nifer o ddwylo,

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.360
yn fwy o ddwylo,

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.360
ond rwy'n credu e'n bwyso hynny

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.360
yn ei ddwylo arno at ei ddwylo

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.540
ac felly roedd hynny ddim yn gwneud

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:11.540
gwahaniaf.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.280

Mae unrhyw gwybodaeth yma.

Ymweldol o ffasiwn, haesdyl neu clwyd, ymddangosodd eich canolbwynt.

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:56.920
A oes gennych chi, fel Elvis Presley neu rhywbeth fel hyn?

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:58.920
Roeddwn i'n fan o'n Clif Richard.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.920
Rwy'n dechrau bod unrhyw beth yw'n dechrau Clif Richard yn wych.

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.920
Rwy'n dechrau bod unrhyw beth yw'n dechrau Clif Richard yn wych.

Dwi'n dechrau beth y gallai nhw amdano amdano amdano.

Roeddwn yn bynnag yn gy不過l when mwn ei symud â'r arian wrth ei ei calio,

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:16.920
oherwydd roeddwn eich bod yn braid iweidio ar Elvis pan roeddwn yn teendrafolan.

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.920
Roeddwn yn meddwl etogyntearog mai chwecau ei fod yn ddigon neckne.

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.920
Felly, rwyf wedi clywed ffilm el Similarly Music.

Wlaid i ni gwrdd yn ffyrdd i'r Schw simplisticyd.

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:10.060
Ond nid oedd yna llawer o fwyd.

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:16.060
Roeddwn i'n gwybod, ymlaen, unrhyw fwyaf, unrhyw fwyaf i'w gweithio a'i gweithio ar y gwaith.

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:20.060
Oherwydd roeddwn i'n gwybod unifor am ysgol.

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:22.060
Roedd hi'n gwybod...

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:24.060
Roedd hi'n gwybod ymlaen neu unrhyw fwyaf fel hyn?

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:26.060
Nid.

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:28.060
Nid oedd yn gwirio'r unrhyw fwyaf i'w gwybod.

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:30.060
Roedd hi'n gwybod.

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:32.060
Roedd fy moth wedi gweithio.

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:35.060
Mae'r holl beth yma yn dweud bod yn ddaol.

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:38.060
Roedd hi'n gwybod oherwydd bod angen i'r fwyaf.

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:41.060
Roedd hi'n gwybod, yn y ffordd, oherwydd ein bod yn ddaol.

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:45.060
Roedd fy moth wedi gweithio'r unrhyw fwyaf.

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:48.060
Pan roeddwn i'n mynd i weithio yn y llyfrgell.

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:53.060
Roeddwn i'n gwybod, yn y ffordd, roeddwn i'n gweithio pan Mark yn dechrau ysgol.

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:57.060
Ond roedd hynny'n ddaol, yn y ffordd, roeddwn i'n gallu ddweud nid.

00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:02.060
Ond pan oeddwn i'n gallu gael y gwaith ymlaen yn Chepstor, yna 1982,

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:07.060
Mark oedd yn 9 o 10, yn y ffordd o'r Junior.

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:11.060
A roeddwn i'n dweud i'r plant, roeddwn i wedi bod yn cael y gwaith hwn,

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:14.060
ond roedd yn y ffordd, y ffrind, a'r mor ddiwrnod.

00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:17.060
Felly roeddwn i'n gwybod, roedden ni'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n ddaol, mor ddiwrnod,

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:19.060
felly byddwn i ddim yn ymwneud.

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:21.060
O, roedden nhw'n credu bod yn fwyaf os oedden ni'n gweithio'r mone.

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:48.860
Roedd yn ddaol, gallwn winterdd i i

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:53.860
Mark, yn y Gweinidogau Comrpain, ac roeddwn i'n y Gweinidogau Gwyrddol yn y Llyfrgell,

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:55.860
felly os oeddwn i'n angen, roeddwn i'n angen.

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:59.860
Ac roedd Mark yn credu bod yn dda iawn i'w ddweud i'w ffrindiau,

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:01.860
ei bod yn cael ei ddwylo ar y Llyfrgell,

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:05.860
yn ymwneud â phwyntiau, roedden nhw'n mynd i'w ddweud,

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:07.860
dyma'r ffrindiau,

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:10.860
felly roedd yn cael ei ddweud, roeddwn i'n ffrindiau,

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:12.860
ac fe ddim yn cael ei ddweud.

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:22.860
Roedd wedi cael y cyfrifiad o gynhyrchwyrwyr

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:26.860
a chyfrifiadau eraill i'r Llyfrgell.

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:29.860
Pan oedd yn cael eu gweld y gwaith yma?

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:32.860
Yn y 1990au, dyna'r bwysic.

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:35.860
Roeddwn i'n gweithio yn Llyfrgell Chesstor.

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:43.860
Roeddwn ni wedi gwneud ok fermented退 y Llyfrgell,

yn y 90au, rydyn ni wedi cael y tîm a'i cyfnodau ei gweithio yn ymwneud â'r

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:15.640
cyfnod, yn y cyfnod, yn y cyfnod. Pan yna oedd yn dda, rydyn ni wedi cael y gweithio

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:21.260
yn Chepstow o gweithio yn ymwneud â'r ffyrdd a'r ffyrdd a'r ffyrdd o'r

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:26.220
ffyrdd a'r ffyrdd. Felly roedd hynny'n mynd ymlaen. Ac roedd ymlaen, wrth gwrs,

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:31.700
i fod yn cael ei gweithio gyda'r ffyrdd a'r ffyrdd o'r ffyrdd a'r ffyrdd, fel y gallwn ni'n cael ei gweithio.

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:38.140
Felly mae gen i'r ddod dda a'r ffyrdd a'r ffyrdd oedd yn dda, a oedd yn un o'r ffyrdd orau cyffredinol

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:45.700
y gallwn ni gael i Chepstow. A yna yn 1993, roeddwn ni'n mynd i fynd i'r Llyfrgell Chepstow newydd,

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:51.700
ac yw pan ydym ni'n mynd yn ymwneud â'r llyfr. Ydym ni wedi cael y gweithiau cymdeithasol

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:57.180
a'r ffyrdd a'r ffyrdd oedd yn cael ei gweithio. Felly, wrth gwrs, gyda'r catalog,

00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:05.060
mae'n rhaid i'w ddod yn ymwneud â'r codau bar ac felly rydym ni i gael i gyrraedd. Ac rydyn ni wedi

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:11.220
Steve, sy'n ymwneud â'r ffyrdd yn ymwneud â'r ffyrdd yn Cymru, yn dod yn cael ei gyrraedd

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:17.060
y ffyrdd gyda ni i gwneud yn siwr y byddai'n gwell. Rydyn ni wedi cael y llysg cymdeithasol

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:22.900
gan y Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru, yn ystafell. Felly, rydyn ni'n gadael

00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:26.860
ar y cwrs, a oedd yn fwy fwy o fawr oherwydd yna'n ffyrdd, ond rydym ni wedi'i gilydd

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:32.020
am ddod i ddod i gydraedd cymdeithasol. Allu ymwneud â'r ffordd a'r llesau a'r

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:37.460
llesau a'r pethau a'r pethau a'r llesau a'r llesau. Rydw i'n meddwl y gallwch chi weld y rhan

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:42.540
o ddiforol o'r llyfrgell. Mae gennych chi, fel llyfrgell, wedi'i gweld yn fawr.

00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:48.220
Mae'n fwy fwy o ffyrdd. Mae'r Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru yn 1964 yn dweud

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:53.180
bod yr athorys wedi, roedd yn gweithio ar gyfer yr athorys i gynnig y gwasanaeth

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:58.140
y Llyfrgell Genedlaethol. Mae hynny nid wedi'i gweithio, ond y Llyfrgell yn ymwneud

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:06.740
yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ei hunain, yn ymwneud eu rôl, oherwydd mae llawer o blesau

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:42.960
yn arfer yn hytrach fel dy鉄 yn eu hunainwyrniad ac mae

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:46.760
aint o drog yn hi'r Llyfrgell yn y perth Holy lot o��eddau bod Office ni.

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:55.720
Hasiwn bod ar yr un ton iawn i i-ddanydd os oedd yn y Llyfrgell y gallai yn enforcement

00:48:55.720 --> 00:49:04.000
o beidiolon o'r gwaith departuri i AIDS, refreshments, sylfiadau

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.680
orch зв jobs?

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:11.240
Yn punchwaith eraill yn aml ynント yn y bryd.

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:19.200
The library now tries to do much more in notary public on vapoxx oed a chludroi

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:24.240
cyhoeddus a am gymdd送remaalau wedi, neu am·drion os bai, yn bondi'r mustchi er mlyniad

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:30.080
Mae hynny'n bwysig iawn.

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:36.440
Mae'n bwysig fel nittana'r a'r grwpau gweithio a phwyaf o'r blynyddoedd.

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:41.120
Roeddwn i'n ddod yn ystod ysgolion.

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:48.120
Mae'n bwysig bod yn ystod ysgolion a'i ddysgu a'i ddangosio'r aelodau i ddefnyddio'r ysgolion

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:50.600
a'i ddweud iddyn nhw beth yw'r blynyddoedd.

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:54.200
Roeddwn i'n mynd i fynd i Gartdicott's Porter Cabinet Library,

00:49:54.200 --> 00:50:00.440
roeddwn i fynd i ddau cyfnodau cymdeithasol y llesydd cymdeithasol i'w ddod,

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:03.640
a roeddwn i'n ddweud am y blynyddoedd a sut i'w ddefnyddio.

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:07.280
Ac yn eithaf, mae llawer o'n ddiddorol hynny a'u ddod yn ddweud,

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:09.200
roedd yn fwyaf i'w ddod yn y blynyddoedd,

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.080
i ddefnyddio'r catalog a'u ddod oherwydd.

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.280
Mae'n bwysig iawn.

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:18.800
Roeddwn i'n mynd i ysgolion a'r blynyddoedd a'u ddysgu.

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:21.400
Roeddwn i'n mynd i un ystry,

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.400
a roeddwn i ddweud, fysgwch i chi i ddod,

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.280
a roeddwn i ddweud, dyna'n dda,

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:28.880
rydym yn glasio i'w ddod o'r blynyddoedd fel blynyddoedd.

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:34.000
Roeddwn i ddweud, rydym yn glasio i'w ddod o'r blynyddoedd fel bwc.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.920
A roeddwn i'n meddwl, wow,

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:39.160
oherwydd fy myfyrwyr a'i ddod o bwc.

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:41.000
A roedd nhw'n aelod o'n bwc i mi.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.400
A roeddwn i'n aelod o bwc fel bwc a chyflosus.

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:46.880
Ond nid yw'r holl bwc yn cael bwc, oes?

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.880
A rwy'n meddwl bod hynny'n anodd yn fawr iawn.

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:49.880
Ie.

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:50.880
Ie.

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:53.000
A'r...

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.000
Dwi'n gwybod...

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.320
Rwy'n gweithio'r ffacilitaeth i mi i'n y Llyfrgell.

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.760
Y system cymdeithasol

00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.520
gyda...

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:02.720
unrhyw ffrwm o ffrwmau gwahanol,

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:03.720
fel amlwg,

00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:05.600
i ddysgu ymchwil a chyflosus,

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.320
a phethau fel hynny.

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:08.960
Felly,

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:11.800
a'r Llyfrgell yn cael cymdeithasol

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:12.800
yn...

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:14.800
yn gweithio hynny,

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:17.280
yn selleu'r programau sy'n mynd yno,

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:19.640
neu a oes yna rhan o bryd?

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:20.640
Y gysylltuadau?

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:21.640
Nid.

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:22.640
Dwi...

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:24.640
Ond pan oeddwn i yno,

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:27.640
byddwn yn ymddygiadu'r rhain fel ymgyrch y Llyfrgell.

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:31.000
A Sally a Cathy,

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.680
sy'n gyflawn i gyd-dwylo a chyflosus,

00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:37.680
byddwn yn cymryd am beth y byddwn yn credu ei gael,

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.680
a byddwn yn ymddygiadu'r rhain

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.680
a chyflosus a chyflosus.

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:46.680
Mae pethau fel anceserau,

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:50.680
a byddai'r budgau'n cael ei ddod i ni ddod i anceserau,

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:54.680
yn ymddygiadu'r rhan o'r blynyddoedd

00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:55.680
y gallwn ni gael.

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:56.680
Oherwydd, efallai,

00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:58.680
llawer o bryd cyfrannu

00:51:58.680 --> 00:51:59.680
oedd yn dda iawn,

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:02.680
a gallwch chi ddod i ni ar un neu ddod oherwydd

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:03.680
oherwydd yna o'r datblygiad.

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:05.680
Felly, dydyn ni ddim yn cael dyrerectoriadau.

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:07.680
Felly, os ydych chi wedi cael £500

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.680
ar un neu ddod oherwydd oherwydd

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.680
oherwydd yna o'r datblygiad,

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:14.680
mae'n dda i chi gael unrhyw beth.

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:17.680
Felly, ymddygiadau a'r cymdeithas

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.680
a'r holl beth,

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:21.680
fel y dda'n dechrau,

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:24.680
wedi newid yr holl ffordd o bethau.

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:27.680
A gydag ddysgu llwyf,

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:29.680
dyna'r peth newydd.

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.680
Yn ystod y cymdeithas,

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:34.680
rydym wedi bod yn rhan o…

00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.680
Beth yw'n ei ddweud?

00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:40.680
Roedd yna unrhyw ddod oherwydd.

00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:44.680
Dydw i wedi gael ei ddynnu.

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.680
Ond roedd yn cael gael,

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:48.680
ar un unrhyw ddod oherwydd,

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:51.680
yr holl bethau sy'n cael gynhyrchu

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:52.680
ymlaen.

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:55.680
A'r Llyfrgell wedi cael gynhyrchu'r ddod oherwydd

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:59.680
oherwydd fan hyn sy'n cael gynhyrchu'r program.

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:00.680
Fel y ddwy i'n dweud,

00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:02.680
bob amser wedi cael ei ddynnu,

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:04.680
y byddwn yn ennill y ddod hwn.

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:07.680
Rwy'n gwybod hwnnw…

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.680
Iawn.

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:12.680
All rwy'n gallu ddweud yw

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:15.680
mae wedi bod yn bwysig

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:17.680
fod yn cael ei ddynnu am ymlaen.

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:18.680
Mae'n cael ei gyd.

00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:20.680
Yn hynny,

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:22.680
dyna'r ffordd y gallwn ni'n credu.

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.680
Mae'n rhaid i ni ddod yn ffwrdd, nid ydym ni?

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:28.680
A'r...

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:31.680
Yw'r fwyaf o...

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:35.680
Cymru'n cael ei ddod yn eich ddod, eich bod wedi'i gwneud i fyw.

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:39.680
Mae rhai aspectau'r ddod, a dydw i ddim gwybod,

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:43.680
dydw i ddod am y danfodau sy'n digwydd yn y sgol,

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.680
yn y goledd.

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:47.680
Mae'n rhaid i ni ddod yn popgrwpau.

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:50.680
Mae'n rhaid i ni ddod yn eich ddod, eich bod yn eich ddod.

00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:53.680
Mae'r Cymru i mi yn bwysig iawn.

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:57.680
A fe ddod i fynd i'r Cymru Methodist, pan oeddwn i...

00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:00.680
am 8.

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:01.680
A dyma...

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:04.680
Roedd fy mwyaf wedi mynd yna, oherwydd roedd hi'n amgu'r Salvation Army yn ymgysylltu,

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:07.680
a dyma'r pwynt ffocol o'n ynglyn â'n ddod,

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:09.680
yn ennill y danfodau.

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:13.680
Ond roedd llawer o ddifornau a phartiau a chyfranniau

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:16.680
yn y ddod.

00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:18.680
A oedd yn y ddod pan oeddwn i'n 8,

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:20.680
ac yn y ddod pan oeddwn i'n gweithio,

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:24.680
oherwydd yna rydw i wedi gynrychi'r Cymru.

00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:28.680
Roedd yn y ddod pan oeddwn i'n gweithio yn 98 a byddwn i'n mynd i'r ddod.

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:32.680
Dyma'r pwynt ffocol o'n ddod, e.

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.680
A phwyaf o bethau.

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:37.680
Roeddwn i'n dweud, bod yn y ffyrdd o'r Cymru Methodist

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:39.680
yn cael...

00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:40.680
Yn hyn.

00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:41.680
...dwyneb.

00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:42.680
Mae'n cael.

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:43.680
Ie.

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.680
Joanna Trollope, un o'r awyr,

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:47.680
roedd hi'n gweithio y ffyrdd o'r Rhector

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:49.680
a roedd hi'n gweithio y ffyrdd o'r Soldier.

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:51.680
A roeddwn i'n mynd i ddiddor at y cyfnod y mae hi'n cael

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:53.680
yn Chetstow Drill Hall

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:54.680
a roedd hi'n dweud,

00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:57.680
mae hi'n ffacinio'n oed o ffyrdd o'u gweithiau

00:54:57.680 --> 00:54:59.680
a'u gweithiau eu gwaith.

00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.680
A dyna'r cyfleoedd ydych chi'n ei wneud,

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:04.680
oherwydd mae llawer o ddifornau i chi

00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:06.680
ac byddai yn y manse.

00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:08.680
Roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ofys.

00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:10.680
Mae'r ffôn ddim yn mynd i'r ffyrdd.

00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.680
Roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ffyrdd i'r ffyrdd

00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:14.680
yma o'r 6 mlynedd y mae Jo'n gweithio,

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:16.680
felly roedd hi'n dda i'n dda i.

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:19.680
Roedd hi'n dda i, a'r ffyrdd?

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:21.680
Churchi Rhownd, mae'n ymlaen.

00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:23.680
Mae'n ymlaen.

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:25.680
Roedd hi'n ymlaen.

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:28.680
Felly mae angen i chi gyrraedd y grwpau Llaidydd?

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:30.680
Nid, roeddwn i'n gweithio.

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:31.680
Roeddwn i'n dweud a Jo,

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:37.680
they don't pay you, you have worked hard from where you've got, you carry on.

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:39.680
So that was fine,

00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:43.680
but I did participate in every way that I could,

00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:47.680
aside from that, I mean we'd have a bible study in the house,

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:52.680
he'd have wedding couples or people wanting christening,

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:54.680
they'd come and he'd see them on a Thursday evening.

00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:56.680
That sort of thing.

00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:58.680
So it was always a sort of office, really.

00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:05.240
o'r cyfnod, neu mae pobl yn dod i weld ei bod yn ei fwyaf, neu llawer o bobl yn gweithio ar y ddau.

00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:12.680
Yn y ffordd, mae'n cael amlwg i fod yn cael rhan o ddau o bryd yn y stafion cyhoeddus, a os bydd unrhywun

00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:16.920
yn mynd i ddweud rhywbeth, bydd yn dweud, rydych chi'n mynd i'r stafion cyhoeddus, ddweud iddo'i

00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:22.280
beth sydd eich bod yn gobeithio ac y byddai'r Rhyngwlad yn gadael i chi. Nid yw rhai o bobl yn gwneud hynny.

00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:27.880
Nid yw'r holl ffordd yw'r ffordd yw'r ffordd yw'r genedlaeth. Felly roedd hynny'n cael

00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:33.080
gwych. Ond, ie, dyna'r ffordd ymwneudiaeth ymlaen i mi, rhywbeth angen i gyd.

00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:39.880
Yn ymwneudiaeth. A pan oeddwch chi'n gweithio?

00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:50.200
Roeddwn i'n gweithio yn 2006, pan oeddwn i'n 60. Ie, dydw i ddod i ddod o ddwy o blynyddoedd i ddod

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:57.520
fy ffordd ymlaen. Ond nid yw'n ffan cymdeithasol iawn. A dda i ddod i ddod i ddod i

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:02.000
bob... well, bob amser oedd yn y cymdeithasol. Roedd gennych llyfr ar y cymdeithasol.

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:07.680
Mae'n bach o'r cymdeithasol, cymdeithasol, cymdeithasol. A dydw i ddim yn eithaf yn dda.

00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:11.200
Dwi'n gwybod nad oedd yn edrych ar y llyfr a ddefnyddio beth oedd yn deall.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.680
Roedd yn ffrostio i mi pan oeddwn i ddod i ddod i ddod i ddod i'r cymdeithasol ac roedd yn dda i ddim yn

00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:20.480
dysguwr i un llya dynam 해�원 mewn lab. went Aaron.

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:29.280
Ond roedd yn bach ychwaneguol iawn, ond roedd yn ffordd c mixingip that a gwrob desiredig.

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:33.160
Rhan todeg iawn o fod yn delis m STAS!

00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:39.520
Rydym yn dweud iawn, yn admel ar anyw cynlluniau goron,

00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:43.280
yn ogystal edrych yng Ng slight eiddio dda ar tasted microscopic theory.

00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:45.280
Mae'n gweithio'n dda.

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:47.280
Dwi'n gallu i chi ddysgu'r ddau.

00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:49.280
Mae'n dda, ond byddwch yn ymwneud â'r ddau.
