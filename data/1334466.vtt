00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This is chapter 24 in our continuing series of podcasts and YouTube videos, slideshows.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Chapter 24. The Race Riots in 1919 and the Institutionalisation of Racism.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The Commission for Racial Equality quote, and there may no longer exist the commission, but nonetheless,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Now, when I was a student studying social sciences in Sheffield Polytechnic in 1985,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I reviewed a book for critical social policy, a journal.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The book was called White Man's Country, Racism in British Politics by Robert Miles and Annie Fazaklia.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Central to the book was the argument that the actions of politicians, trade unions, etc. in the 1962 to 1971 period

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
effectively institutionalised racism in British politics and the state.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I agreed then. I thought they were right, but I don't agree now.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And as Nelson Mandela says, there's nothing like returning to a place that remains unchanged

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
to find the ways in which you yourself have altered.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Miles and Fazaklia and many others argued that the three conditions being meant that racism was institutionalised in politics,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
those three conditions they set out were in effect number one.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:01.000
There was at the time an overwhelming political and common sense consensus that race and immigration was a major issue for political policy.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
All the parties in that period of six to ten, anyone was saying that.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Two, the debate had shifted beyond immigration control.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Although still accepting immigration control was the solution, it had shifted to stopping the influx of families to come and live with immigrants.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And three, there was a significant shift towards the repatriation of immigrants, those who weren't us, one might argue.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So the politicians wanted immigrants out. The people wanted them out and even agreed they should be sent home.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
This was of course followed by legislation to make it possible.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The trade unions congress response to the 1971 immigration bill summed up their abandonments of black workers.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Many aspects of the government policy had not been made plain and the general council decided that a simple condemnation would not deal with the complex issues involved.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
The TUC, trade union congress, which meant they did nothing.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000
They didn't challenge, they considered and continued to debate while the legislation went through.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
This is my opinion and it is only my opinion.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:26.000
It's not a position adopted by our funders, Heritage Lottery or by HDA, who are the organisation that I'm a member of.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:38.000
But in my opinion, the only significant difference between 1919 and 1971 seems to be the public nature of Westminster's politicians.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
They said things privately then, privately meaning in letters, text, etc.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
In June 1915, the assistant chief constable of Liverpool wrote to the home secretary as follows.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.000
If there is any power to intern them, that is black people, either on board ships or one of the military camps,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and what steps would he suggest in removing the black population, some 2,000 to 3,000 by compulsory repatriation or otherwise?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.000
The Lord Mayor wrote in support if the government could repatriate these black men without delay.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Now the response from the home secretary of the time, Edward Short, KC, sums up the feelings of the government.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And I choose not to use the in quotes N-word. Edward Short was not so sensitive.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Thank you for your letter about the Liverpool N. I must say I am pleased by the subtlety of it.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Having worked with these men in the army and having then demobilised them in this unfortunate country,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
the military authorities plead no jurisdiction.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000
However, my immediate object in writing this is to say that we hear from the chief constable of Liverpool

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:12.000
that General Edwards has agreed to take these blacks into a camp if the war office will give him the necessary authority for which he has telegraphed.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Would you kindly see that he has a telegram tonight giving him authority?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
That was from Edward Short to his relevant civil servant.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Across the cities where the race riots occurred, local politicians demanded repatriation. So did the police.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
The unions took no action to help black people who were being attacked or black workers.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Perfectly summed up by Manny Shinwell, trade union leader then, but later a significant Labour politician, in Glasgow.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.000
He contributed to the race riots there by speaking at a meeting blaming foreign workers for taking white men's jobs.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Now I was brought up in the East End of London and that's quite disturbing.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Emmanuel Shinwell, Baron Shinwell, as he was to became, come, were known formally as Manny, was a British Labour politician.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:16.000
He was born in the East End of London to a large family of Jewish immigrants and he moved to Glasgow when he was about 11.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:25.000
During the war, the alien workers, including those from Empire, had to have identity cards in the form of Siemens tickets.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.000
They were then required to show after the war that they were British citizens, even though there was no real way of showing this.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Poverty was then used as a way to deport them.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:46.000
They were refused the right to work on ships by agreement between the government and the ship owners, private agreement.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And then when they couldn't manage or sustain themselves in money or food, bylaws and another law was introduced to actually say,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:05.000
if you were in poverty and could not sustain yourself, the decent thing was to send you home.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So they created the circumstance to force them to leave.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
The problem, however, was their families.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:24.000
This generation in Wales and across the UK were married to white women who could not be deported and nor could the children and the men would not leave them.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Racism was institutionalised in 1919, in my opinion.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:39.000
The press blamed black people for unemployment and constantly used interracial relationships as a justification for white people's anger.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000
The notion of black and white people in a sexual relationship continually appears.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
The government used them as a reason for the inadequacies of the system after the war.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
No homes, no jobs, etc.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And the trade union used black people as a target to deflect anger away from their unwillingness to confront government about not enough jobs, not enough homes.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And very poor treatment of the soldiers returning from war.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
All of this was done under a justification that the public were angry.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And therefore the smokescreen that was to be used over and over in the decades to follow and was to be a platform for politicians to use during electoral speeches became part of the political culture.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:43.000
So the way that the 1919 race riots was dealt with by government, the trade unions and the media provided a blueprint for generations to follow.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:52.000
The events of 1971 were actually in response to the Windrush generation, which of course includes Uganda and Asia.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Not merely.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Asian people, I should say, not merely Caribbean.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
In a way that is the problem.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:07.000
So much of history about black and minority people has been written about the post 1950 generation of arrivals.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And the experience of those in Wales, Liverpool, etc. who were third generation by then is a forgotten history.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
In every sense, Wales, like Liverpool, has a different history.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And that history is the invisible one that needs telling more than ever.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Our road to citizenship is a lesson to be learned from, not to be ignored.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Even David Lloyd George has said the world is becoming like a lunatic asylum run by lunatics.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:49.000
So my argument is that racism wasn't institutionalised by the state, etc. in 1971 because an immigration law was introduced.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:10:09.000
My argument is the conditions by which racism and state institutionalised racism became an acceptable part of the culture of this country, this nation, were established in 1919, immediately after World War I.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And those conditions were about scapegoating the outsider.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.000
The problem is, and Wales is the perfect example of this, those people are not outsiders anymore.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And they weren't in 1919.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And by the start of the Second World War and racism was beyond the control of the government.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:51.000
So rather than try and deal with it and rectify it, they accepted it as part of the culture that said people were unhappy in society because of black people being in the country.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:59.000
So the 1919 race riots in themselves happened and were over relatively quickly in Wales and the UK.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
But the state of mind that was to follow, particularly in England, still continues.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Thank you.
