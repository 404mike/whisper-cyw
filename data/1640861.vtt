00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I was born in Brecon in South Wales, September 42,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
attended local primary school,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and then attended Crass College boarding school as a day boy,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
which is where I learned to play rugby,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
which was quite important a few years later.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I went to the Cubs and Scouts in Brecon,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and climbed Penny Man many times with the Scouts,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
so I was active.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
As I say, it's a joke to everybody over here,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
when you're born in Brecon, you're born with a pair of boots on.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And then September 54 to July 58, I was at Crass College,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
a memorable day, 16th of October 1959,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I caught the stream train from Brecon to Hereford,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
went out onto the yard,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and climbed into a bed for three tonne, REF-wise,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and that was where I started my REF life.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I said, my entrance at REF Hereford in the supply trade.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
That went down for 18 months.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Of course, sport was one of the things we took part in,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
excuse me, so rugby came into it again.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And also, there was another lad who had joined up from Ponticammer,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and he was rugby, I was a hooker, whereas he was on the wing.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I've remained in contact ever since.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
In fact, we spoke to each other on Christmas Day this year.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So that's 61 years ago now, 62 years ago.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So 18 months at Hereford, passed out on the 24th of March 1961,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
which is when you're in the force, you remember your service number,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and you remember mostly dates as well, the postage.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
But on leaving Hereford, they sent me to 16 maintenance unit at Stafford,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
which was not an operational unit.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It was a massive big storehouse with warehouses

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
over all different areas around Stafford.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And I was in the equipment, the office where all the requests for stock

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
came in to us initially, reprogrammed them and said,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
right, we've got so much of this, so much of that,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
it'll be sent out to you, something such.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
We didn't work, we worked day shift basically,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
but one had to sleep in the office at night in case any urgent priority demands came in.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So that's where my life started on shift, working night shifts in a way.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
While I was at the area of Stafford, the people decided,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Oh, John Evans, you can go on a movements course to Arliff, Lindsay,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Curtindinje, Lincolnshire.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So I was there for six weeks learning how to unload, unload aircraft, et cetera,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
do all the manifest for the ship, build some lading for ships,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and a great group convoy, policewives, et cetera,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
checked if they could go under low bridges and the like.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So August 1963, having been at Stafford just over two years,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
they sent me to 86th movement unit at Düsseldorf, Germany,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000
which was again a little unit with 10 RAF lads on a big army base.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
We were there on the Rhine, they put the doctoral on the Rhine there,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and we know what freight was coming over on the ferry from Harwich or whatever to Rotterdam.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
It would get transship then onto the barges and brought down the Rhine.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And we'd have no in advance, as I say, so when the bulky stuff was coming in,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
we had to advise whichever unit would be requested the items to be on the dock side

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
with their wagons, pick it up.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
So as it came off the barge, it went straight onto the lorry and back to base.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I enjoyed that.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
One of the dockers there, a German lad named Henry,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
he'd been in prison at war with Stockinghall Street, Glasgow,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and he always wore a bowler hat, all the time, a bowler hat.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And the first thing they went overboard when the lads went into the hold on the crane was a crate of beer.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
They wouldn't work until they'd had a beer each, first thing.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And while I was there, again, I played rugby there.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:39.000
It was while on the dock once that a smallish item fell off the crane and caught my left knee and broke my ankle.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
So I had to go to hospital, and it was a German hospital being looked after by nuns.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
I was there for about three days, and then they said, right, you're fitting up to move.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
So I then went to a military hospital in Bedford for another week,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and then back to the unit because our unit had tussled off.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
The corridor we actually hadn't slept in, the combination,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
the next corridor was the actual offices, so I didn't have to go outside either.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
It was all inside.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
So I still carried on working there.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
There for two and a half years.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.000
While I was there, I bought a brand new Simca car, 450 Dodge Mars as it was there.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So when I came back after two and a half years in Dusseldorf, they posted me to Lyne, which, oh good,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000
this is a fully operational station with aircraft flying, transport command, not fighters, transport command,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Beverly Tigers, Britannias, Comet 2s and 4s, and then VC10s eventually.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And they put me in there as a trim clerk doing the weight and balance trim.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
The lads would load the aircraft, and each aircraft was divided into compartments.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
So they'd tell me how much weight had gone into each compartment,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and the air quarter master would submit the blank trim sheet initially

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000
with the weight of the aircraft itself, the weight of the fuel that was going to be put on board,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and I put in the weight of the freight in the compartments.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Then they worked a graph out for the pilot to know how to take off, what angle, et cetera,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and how to keep a level on flight.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I was there for two and a half years, and then I got posted to Bahrain.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
But when I was due to Bahrain, I sold the car for £450,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
because I didn't have to pay any tax when I brought it into the country,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
unless you keep it for two years.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
So I was over two years having it there, so I didn't pay tax when I sold it,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
but it sold for £450.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
So I didn't lose a thing on that deal, because I suppose I must have got a cheap rate in the civil world.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I was posted from Lyon to Bahrain, I was there for 13 months.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
It was a staging post for all the aircraft that left Lyon.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
They'd go to Cyprus, Bahrain, Gange, Singapore and Hong Kong,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
all go out to Cyprus and back to Bahrain and back.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
We were a staging point for all the transport command.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And when I arrived and walked down the gang plank for the first time,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
the local lads said, oh, you're cutting the moonies?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Of course, we were all white, weren't we?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Whereas they'd been there for a few months, and they were quite tanned by then.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So it took me a while, but I soon got a tan.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
On days off, we'd clip clothes on and shorts,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and walk up the edge of the runway when we knew there was no aircraft coming in,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
in the 40-plus degrees heat by the time we had climatised.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
We were working out in the pans anyway, in all the heat.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
The 13 months there, while there we used to go out on fishing trips

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
on the local down with a couple of Arabs.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
I'm not a fisherman, but I used to go out there.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And we used to swim as well in the water.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Lovely clear water, nicely warm, etc.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
That was great, that was for 13 months.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
The only lady on the camp was the woman's voluntary service lady

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
who ran the local cafe, information place, etc.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000
But when we went off camp, we had to put long trousers on and long-sleeved shirts.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
We weren't allowed off camp in shorts and T-shirts,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:37.000
to agree with the local religious things.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
See, that was 13 months.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I was then posted back to 16MU Stafford,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
I said, oh no, not back there again, that's a boring job.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Surprisingly, on my arrival at the guardhouse at Stafford to book in,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
the Snowdrop, or the Arab Police is the correct title,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
said, oh, you've got to report to the station commander,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
because what have we done wrong now?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
So I went to the station wardrobes at first, which you will do,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and he said, oh yes, the station commander wants to see you,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
from Cork, yes, come upstairs,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and he shook me hand and said, congratulations, SSC Ems,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
you are now Corkle Ems, I got promoted.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
So two takes on my arm.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
It was all computerised by them in stores at Stafford,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and they put me on the emergency call-out team who go out at night

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
to different units to get the stuff and get it well organised in a way.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
But having been in movements for six, seven years,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
I had no idea how to work a computer, stores-wise,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
so the lads carried me, I must admit, they showed me what to do,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
and said if I could do it, they did it.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
There were a good group of lads there.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
But in the meantime, in the station weekly bulletin came an advert,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Corkle Storemen wanted a Sax of Aude.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
The Sax of Aude, of course, is the most northerly island

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
of the Shetland group.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
You can't go any further north until you go to Norway virtually.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
So I applied, I was in three months, I was up at Aberdeen,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
catching the overnight ferry to Lerwick,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
which is on the mainland, the main town of Shetlands,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
arrived there, I would say overnight, arrived in the morning,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
bus into Lerwick town, bus from Lerwick to the north of the main island,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and then a little ferry, if you want to use the word correctly,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
it was a rowing boat with an outboard boat at the back,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
which should bus six people,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
ten minute trip across to the middle island, the L,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
and then you had a bus journey from that point there,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000
halfway across the island, changed buses, and joined the next trip.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
The reason being why you had to change was two brothers

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
ran the bus services, but they'd fallen out.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
So one had the southern area of the island,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
one had the northern island section.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So I got up to the northern end of Yale,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
and then another ferry, onboard motor on a sort of six-seater rowing boat,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:19.000
arrived at Gutsjärg, G-U-T-C-H, which is the ferry point on the Udst,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
U-N-S-T, which is where we were stationed,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
and again a three-channel met me,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and took me up to Saxon Board,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
introduced me to the sergeants in stores,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
and were actually realized that I'd been on boots for seven years,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
and said, oh no, not another one.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Obviously somebody else had been there as well,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
who hadn't been on stores for quite a while.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
So they introduced me again to their system of doing things.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
I'd 18 months up there, I used to go walking on days off,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
I was on the domestic side, where the radar side,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
which was their prime reason for being there,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
watching for the Russian Red Bears,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
which were flying over into the UK airspace.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
So I get a lift up to the radar side,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and then walk across the island, the turf, etc.,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
to the most northern point of the UK,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
and look over Muckle Plugger Lighthouse,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000
M-U-C-K-L-E-F-L-U-G-G-A, Muckle Plugger Lighthouse.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
But you had to be careful during breeding season,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
because they had what they called skewers,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
which are seagulls, but rather large seagulls,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
and they dive on you, and without a hat on,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
they would literally put their clothes into your head.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
That's the during breeding season.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
I also had to be aware, because they laid their nests on the ground,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
not in trees, because Zunst didn't have any trees,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
as most of the Sheffield doesn't.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
It's so windy up there.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
I used to go across there quite often.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
But one thing I remember, which didn't really affect me,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
up on the radar side, there were three scanners up there,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
but this other bit, between each building,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
there were posts, they'd exit into the ground,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
and there were ropes going from one post to another.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And when it was really windy,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
you literally had to hang onto the ropes

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
to go from one building to another.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
You went on the edge of the cliff, or such,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
but you could get blown over and blown around.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And you had to put two parkas on.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
It was that cold at times when you were outside up there.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
So I had 18 months of it.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Other times, I used to go walking, talk to the Sheffield Cumbies.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
They used to dance back across from me.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Not that I could understand them.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And then I had 18 months up there, posted back to UK,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
to Arleigh of Thornay Island, which is on the Chastis Hancho border.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
A little island just off Willis.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Not an island, that's Chastis.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
A stream of divides, Thornay Island from the mainland.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
That was in 1971.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
I read it in D-Bomb in 1972.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
But while I was there, I got warned,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Oh, you're going to Belfast Airport, Aldergrove,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
but posted temporary.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
So I arrived there the day after Bloody Sunday.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Monday, the day after Bloody Sunday.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Back to Movers, of course, not stores by now.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
A few hair-raising occasions,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
because I was on the camp all the time.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
But every fourth night, two of us, myself and an SCC,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
would go around with the Android Corporal on security control

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
around the perimeter every fourth night to support them.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
I'd have a pistol in my holster,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
and the SCC would have a rifle.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
I think it was a Lee entry 303 still in those days.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Not these modern guns that they have.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
So I did my time up there, then back to Thornay Island.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
I was in the National Games, and D-Bomb's in September 1972.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
That's my life in the RAF.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And then talking about sport,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:18.000
one of the retired English cricket 15, Brian Statham,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
did his national service at Stafford,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
but this was before I ever got there.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
And again, playing rugby,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
one of the wings who was on his national service at the time,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
I can't remember his name, but I think he was Sullivan,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
but his uncle or father, not sure which again,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
was a rugby league professional player playing for St Helens.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
And I'm not sure if this lad, Don D-Bomb,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
went into sport professionally or somebody else.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
I'm not sure.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Changing the subject now slightly,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
I was stationed at Lionand.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
I was the trim clerk for all the aircraft.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And one of my jobs apart from doing the trim clerk,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
every aircraft they left had what they called the station seat onboard,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
which anybody working on the station could use to go anywhere

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
that that aircraft was going.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
So I used to book myself a seat on the aircraft out to Cyprus,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
because one of the lads I joined up with,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
who I'm now still in contact with,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
the party come in, Coline,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:32.000
was married by then, stationed out there in Madden Quarters at Limassol.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
And I used to go out for long weekends,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
every three or four months,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
on the botanical, whatever was going out.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
The only risk you had, you wouldn't definitely get a seat back.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
You had to be careful because you couldn't book a seat back

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
in case it was taken up by some emergency.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
But lucky enough, I managed to get back every time,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
step off the aircraft, quick shower, uniform, and straight to work.
