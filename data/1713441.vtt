00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.720
Initially, let us say thank you from HDA to the Heritage Lottery Wales for their support

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.200
in enabling us to undertake this series of podcasts.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:23.240
This podcast is about the Glamorganshire Canal.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.600
The Glamorganshire Canal in South Wales first started in 1790 and the reason it is relevant

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:37.360
to Bute Town is that is where it ended up.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.800
And a lot of people don't know where it is now.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:49.080
But nonetheless, it ran from Merthyr down to Cardiff and the sea.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:56.520
In 1794 the canal was opened between Cardiff and Merthyr over the mountains of South Wales.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.020
This was considered fairly wondrous at the time.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:09.920
Within 24.5 miles it rose to a height of 300 meters requiring 49 locks.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.760
As you will understand what a lock does.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.320
The lock controls levels.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:26.600
So every time a canal barge now or then goes through a lock, two lock gates close.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.520
One behind it, one in front of it.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:38.360
And if it is travelling to Cardiff from Merthyr, every time that happened it dropped in height

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.460
and came out the other gate lower than the original height.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:51.980
So it is important to think of lock gates as a series of stairs, steps so to speak.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:02:00.580
So when the canal was opened in 1794 Cardiff had a population of just 4,000 people.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:09.400
And in 1798 the canal was extended one mile seaward and included a sea lock.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:15.640
The total cost of building the canal was £103,600.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.040
The hills and valleys surrounding Merthyr were rich with limestone, iron ore and coal.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.480
The canal predominantly followed the route of the River Tath and was able to carry these

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.100
raw materials and finished goods from the four Merthyr ironworks far more cheaply and

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.680
quickly than the previous method which was mule train.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.480
Merthyr at the time was the largest town in Wales.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.840
That was in 1850.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.400
It was twice the size of its nearest rival Swansea and greater than the combined populations

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.560
of Swansea and Cardiff.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.560
Merthyr's growth was brought about due to the expansion of the iron industry.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.280
It was the industrial heart of Wales.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:11.320
The four great ironworks, Dowlus, Penadarren, Plymouth and Caerphartha were able to transport

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.440
their finished iron on a single barge 9 foot wide and 60 foot long.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:26.320
24 tonnes of iron could be towed by one horse needing only one man and a boy to run it efficiently.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.160
These round trips in Cardiff could be completed in a fortnight.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.200
Previously the tonnage required 48 horses, 12 men, 12 boys and would take significantly

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.480
longer.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.760
Despite the railway boom in the 1840s and the opening of Bute Docks in Cardiff the canal

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.200
continued to flourish.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.160
The Industrial Revolution, especially the coal boom in South Wales, saw unprecedented

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.680
growth of trade on the canal.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:06.760
In 1858 at its economic peak the canal transported 467,000 tonnes of coal.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.160
Within a decade this had slowed considerably.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.200
The canal was a victim of its own success.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:21.560
The trade boom and subsequent congestion was the primary cause of its decline.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:28.640
Richard Crochet, owner of the Carpatho Ironworks, had the canal built to his ironworks in Merthyr.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:37.160
He then opposed all efforts from the three other ironworks owners to do the same.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.720
They tried to extend the canal or allow feeders to be built and this eventually led to the

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:50.760
setting up of the Taff Vale Railway Company by the three other iron masters to transport

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.440
their wares to Cardiff.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.520
By 1888 the canal was owned by Lord Bute.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.080
Lord Bute planned to use much of the canal on which to build a railway.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.120
Its economic life was effectively over.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:13.840
Although sand dredges and timber floats carried on using parts of the canal until 1942.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.280
There are very little remains of the canal in Cardiff today.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:27.960
The exception is the Glamorganshire Canal Nature Reserve at Corryton adjacent to junction 32 of the M4,

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.200
some five miles from Cardiff Docks.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:38.080
The one kilometre stretch of the canal was lovingly restored in the 1960s.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:45.240
And that's the only jewel of the canal and that's in Forest Farm Country Park.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.720
Today limited traces of the canal remain.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.520
About one half being covered by the A470 Cardiff to Merthyr Tydfil Drunk Road which was constructed

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.480
in the 1970s.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.680
Much of the Taff trail between Abercunnan and Merthyr Tydfil follows the line of the canal.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:10.440
A section from Tanguinalis to the Melingrefeth Tin Plateworks at Wychurch has been retained

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:17.760
in water and was used for fishing but is now the Glamorganshire Canal Local Nature Reserve.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.320
In addition there are a few bridges and locks which have not been destroyed.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:32.080
There's also a short stretch in water at 19 Gale Bush and at locks 31 and 32 in Pontypriddh.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.960
A boat weighing machine, one of only four known to have existed on British canals,

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.400
was originally installed at Tanguinalis and was later moved to North Road Cardiff.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:48.720
The machine was presented to the British Transport Commission in 1955 and was re-erected at the

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.880
Stoke-Burn Canal Museum in Northamptonshire.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:59.440
In 2013 it was moved to the National Waterfront Museum in Swansea.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:06.520
Let's briefly consider another very very important building, very near the North Norwegian Church,

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.080
the Pierhead building.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.880
Bright red it appears in every single photograph.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:19.720
It's grade one listed and it's built in what is now Cardiff Bay, Wales but of course was

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.920
on the docks.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:27.640
It was originally built in 1897 as the headquarters for the Bute Dock Company.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.800
It's now part of the estate of Senedd Cymru, the Welsh Parliament, which also includes

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.840
the Senedd Building at Teowel.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:43.440
The clock on the building is unofficially known as Baby Big Ben or the Big Ben of Wales.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.280
The building was built by the English architect William Frame and it was a replacement for

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:53.960
the headquarters of the Bute Docks Company which burnt down in 1892.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:59.080
The Bute Dock Company was renamed Cardiff Railway Company in 1897.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:07.280
A coat of arms on the building façade bears the company motto, The Water and Fire, by

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.780
Water and Fire.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:17.040
The building became the administrative office to the Port of Cardiff in 1947.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:23.560
There are a number of other listed buildings in Cardiff Bay and the Docklands which give

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:33.560
you a sense of the opulence and wealth that existed in Cardiff Docks.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:40.820
Much of what you now sit on, if you're at that end of Butetown and Cardiff, actually

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:47.260
never existed because it was underwater and the docks were filled.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.940
For a lot of children from Butetown, going back to the Glamourne

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:56.580
Chiew Canal, their memories are very clear of it.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:03.580
I say children, I mean those in their 60s, 70s, 80s.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:13.640
They remember swimming in the canal, making boats, remember some of their friends drowning

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.340
in there.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:23.420
So, Glamourne Chiew Canal was a significantly important part of the growth of the docks.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:29.820
But the thing that I find most interesting in a lot of ways is that when it was first

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:36.460
opened Merthyr was the biggest town in Wales.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:40.620
And I will continually restate this point.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:51.700
And then thanks in part to the vision and the wealth of Lord Bute and a number of iron

00:09:51.700 --> 00:10:04.900
work companies, but largely, in my opinion, to the sweat of the miners at one end, the

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:12.900
iron workers at one end, and at the other end, the merchant seamen and dock workers.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:19.900
Cardiff grew beyond Merthyr, beyond Swansea, and became the capital of Wales.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:28.900
So that's just a brief explanation of the Glamourne Chiew Canal and the Pierhead building.
