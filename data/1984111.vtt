00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.560
My name is David Mayer and I've been going to gigs in Newport since 1965.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:23.920
In 1985 I became the agent for Newport West and prospective MP Paul Flynn.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.460
Around that time the Red Wedge group had set up.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.940
It included the Commonards, Style Council, Paul Weller, Billy Bragg, as well as loads

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.280
of other top bands of the period.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:46.220
The Labour Party in London sent us a Red Wedge pack to encourage local action among young

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.620
voters.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:56.060
Newport West was only formed in 1983 and at that election the Tories won by about 500

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.500
So we were a target seat for the 1987 election.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.860
We heard that Billy Bragg was interested in playing Newport so we arranged a gig at Cullion

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.640
College.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:17.100
We also organised a day of events on Saturday 1st February at the Newport Centre, which

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:26.540
mostly music related things such as guitar and drum lessons, songwriting, poetry etc.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:33.200
A few weeks earlier Paul Flynn and I actually gate crashed the green room of the Commonards

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.140
gig at Newport Centre so that we could put flyers on the seats for the Billy Bragg events.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.420
I designed the posters and flyers using the Red Wedge promotional material they sent.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.740
I introduced Paul to Jimmy Somerville who seemed a bit distant as did all the band,

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.380
probably psyched up for the performance or maybe they had an argument.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.820
Paul had no idea who Jimmy Somerville was of course, being from a different generation.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.100
We distributed the flyers and watched the opening songs but it was too loud and alien

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.820
for Paul unfortunately so we left.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:22.540
On Friday 31st January 1986 Billy played the main hall at Cullion College, then a teaching

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.540
college.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.380
The hall was rammed.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:33.860
Billy was supported by legendary local band The Abs and a band called Atacco di Centi,

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.620
an interesting percussive orientated band from Brighton that Billy endorsed around that

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.500
time.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.180
About half way through Billy's performance some drunk Tory hecklers started shouting

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.460
abuse and a scuffle broke out.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.460
Billy stopped playing and asked the audience to resolve it peacefully.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:02.340
He said, if you hold your hands out, palms facing up, you can direct the troublemakers

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.500
out of the fire doors.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.820
This happened.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.380
It was unbelievable.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.780
The three Tories were guided towards the side doors and out.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.420
There was nothing they could do to resist.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.380
I've never seen anything like it.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.980
I don't think Billy had, although he may have heard of it.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.220
I had a great view of all this happening from the balcony on the left of the stage.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.860
Afterwards Billy thanked me for organising the gig and was clearly buzzing from the performance

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.300
and the ejection of the troublemakers.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.180
He had heard about this being done but had never seen it himself.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.940
He held both of my hands and would not let go.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:53.340
I said I have to leave as I am giving a lift to one of the young party members to Pontypool.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.260
It took about five minutes to break away.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.020
I didn't know it at the time but in the audience was someone who would become one of my closest

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.820
friends, Jane Mudd, now leader of the council, who blagged her way on stage at one point.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:19.820
The next time I met Billy Bragg was at the Bevan Institute 60th birthday celebration for the NHS

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.300
in July 2008 at the Senedd.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.300
I also designed the brochure and badge for this event and helped organise the front of house.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.660
After his performance there I asked him if he remembered the night at Cleon

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.980
and he looked at me bemused.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.100
I described the event with the Tories but he said he could not remember

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:50.140
a thing which I guess after 30 years of touring well.
