00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
Shall we go back to your grandfather?

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.040
Yes, go where you like.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.840
Alright, he was from Kiev.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.360
Yes.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.000
And that's why he knew my grandparents, was it?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I don't know.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.320
And what did he do?

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.240
He was a tobacconist.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.720
Alright, yeah.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.080
Oh, sorry.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.480
Alright.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.280
Go on then, tobacconist.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.280
Yeah.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:44.400
In Cardiff in those years, no it's okay, in those years, he owned all the kiosks in Cardiff.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:54.280
Kiosks were small little units that sold cigarettes and they sold them at cut price.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.840
Right.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:05.920
And they had, pardon me, they...

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.720
Was that Wood Street then?

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:17.120
They had a shop in Wood Street, a shop in Curbridge Road, all the kiosks in the city.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.840
Right.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.560
And that was basically their business.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.560
Okay.
