00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:08.760
Of course, while at Lambeter, we moved there in late 1939,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.360
and ultimately the Battle of Britain took place.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.480
I was about, I think, at that time, getting on 16 or 17,

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.200
and we used to follow the course of the battle on the radio,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.160
and I always remember a marvelous score by the RAF,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.640
183 aircraft, German aircraft, shot down,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.400
which turned out to be a little on the high side,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.840
but I remember all the boys were cheering

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.200
and were very chuffed at that happening.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:55.600
1940, I found myself stationed at Duxford

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.840
on the actual time of the Battle of Britain.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:10.000
Duxford was in, I think it was known as Twelve Group,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:19.880
which really looked after the air control of the Midlands, really,

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.040
but below it was Eleven Group,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.600
and both were obviously in close relation.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.080
The radio operator was at the back of the control room,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.560
and the control room consisted of a plotting board

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:48.120
with WAF lady plotters, a senior RAF officer controller,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.720
alongside him was an army officer,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.040
and a good, great collection of a naval presence.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:04.720
I'm not too sure about that, but anyway, behind all this,

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:12.480
maintaining the air traffic conversation and recording it

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.960
were the radio operators.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.960
I spent a couple of months, I think it was,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.080
during the Battle of Britain.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.880
I can remember dog fights up above,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:39.280
and Duxford itself was bombed and damaged once or twice,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.920
but I wouldn't have described it as being heavily bombed

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:53.720
as I was to experience later in my RAF career,

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:01.360
where I spent most of the war on a different branch

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.880
of radio operating on the island of Malta.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.440
I remember the blitz very clearly, the Battle of Britain.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.480
I saw dog fights occasionally overhead,

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.640
and then I was conscripted into the WAF

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.680
and started off at Horn Church in the Ops Room,

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.640
but it wasn't there long before the Ops Room was closed down

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.160
and we were all transferred to North Weald.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.960
What were you doing at Horn Church?

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.760
I was a plotter.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.840
And what does that mean?

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.480
You wore the headphones and you got a table, a plotting table,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.080
and you had lots of little arrows of different colours,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.280
and every five minutes they were changed.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.600
You plotted the position of the hostiles and the friendlies.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.200
And I didn't do that for long

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.440
because they knew that I had drawing office experience,

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.520
and so I was asked to assist the draftsman,

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.280
who was a great one for playing table tennis

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.480
if anyone was off duty.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.560
So I assisted him for a week and I was deemed responsible,

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.920
and he was posted overseas,

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.560
and I took over all the work of the drawing office.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.000
But we weren't there for long when we were transferred

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.400
to North Weald.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.440
The Ops Room there was a big country house called Blake Hill,

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.320
away from the airfield for obvious reasons.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.560
And it looked like a big country farm.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.600
There were cattle grazing in the fields,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.040
and our huts were, well, it was called the rockery

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.920
because we were amongst the trees,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.640
so we weren't really noticed from the air.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.640
And the rooks used to roost in the tops of the trees,

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.080
that's why we were called the rockery.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.080
And it was very interesting work there.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.720
The Battle of Burton, of course,

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.720
when the air war did get going,

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.120
we saw, I suppose, quite a lot of it in London.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.160
And the coastal towns, like Cardiff, for instance,

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.160
was right in their sights.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.840
Anyway, it seemed in London,

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.000
we did get a lot of air activity there.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.680
We could see the Germans coming over.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.240
No, the first we saw of them,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.520
because they used to come over at night.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.640
And we knew they were Germans,

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.720
by the sounds of their engines.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.120
But at the time,

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.680
there seemed to be no anti-aircraft activity at all.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.520
And the people would be out in the streets saying,

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.960
where's the guns, where's the guns?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.440
And they were really bitter about it.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.240
There was no opposition to these aircraft.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.920
They were flying around.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.240
But the thing was, it didn't drop any bombs.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.360
They must've been on reconnaissance, you see,

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.920
flying the job up.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.760
And then suddenly, from being no air activity,

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.040
from somewhere they produced and set up,

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.360
terrific gun barrage.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.640
And everybody was out in the street cheering the guns.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.040
Not thinking of falling shrapnel from the shells,

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.200
which could've killed you with certain,

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.000
certainly there were a lot of people killed

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.320
through falling shrapnel.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.960
But it really put a new life into the people

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.880
that at last they've started doing something about it.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.000
And of course, being young and dull,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.600
I think I knew that every bomb dropped in Pembrokeshire,

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.280
because I used to go there and have a look at it,

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.680
and have a look, great nosy.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.640
But one night in particular, they were dropping the bombs.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.640
And I was standing outside the door as usual.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.400
Most of the firemen were inside.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.520
And I spotted this big parachute coming down.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.200
And I said, oh look, I said, there's a parachute coming down.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.200
Next meant there was this almighty flash, purple and blue.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.240
And I can remember like today,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.480
it punched the blast, punched me in the chest.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.080
I went flying backwards,

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.120
I don't remember no more after that.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.280
But apparently the men said,

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:15.080
I went past him like a rocket into the fire station,

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.640
behind the fire engine, and finished up in the corner.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.800
And of course, with all the stuff that was on the shelves,

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.440
it all came down on top of me,

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.080
and put some paint and all that.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.240
But luckily none of them opened up.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.640
But I don't remember any more of it

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.480
until I woke up in the control room

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.920
on one of the camp beds,

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:43.480
and one of the telephone girls washing my mouth out

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:48.480
and my face, because there was so much dust everywhere.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.280
I was nearly blinded with it.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.200
And I got up, none the worse,

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.680
once I got on my feet, I was okay.
