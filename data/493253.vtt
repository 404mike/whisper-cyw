00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is William Morris Jones talking again about Barry docks.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Were you going to tell me something about pilfering?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In the war time, I personally didn't have any personal recollection of it.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But I guess what I was told by my father, that the problem there, it wasn't only true of Barry docks, it was true of all ports.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
That the lifeboat emergency rations were plundered by people.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
What sort of people?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The workers on the dock, dockside workers.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And this is what resulted if a ship that sank and a man had to go into the lifeboat.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
They found there was no food in, no emergency rations.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Because it had been pilfered?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Because it had been pilfered.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And your father told you this?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Yes.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Did he take any action about it?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Well if they were caught, they would be severely punished.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Was there a detective force at the docks?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Not to my knowledge.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So it's just this lifeboat pilfering?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Yes, in the war time.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
What sort of rations did they have?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Biscuits, hard rationed biscuits.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Biscuits and things that would keep.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And when they took these biscuits and things, did they keep them for themselves or sell them on?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I think they were sold on.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Oh I can tell you now, this again is in the war time.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I personally have no personal recollection of it.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
There was an American army depot there.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
In Barrie?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
In Barrie, yes, a big one, a large one.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Do you recall the depot?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I can't remember, it was before I went to work there.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And it was full of all kinds of things for American...

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Oh you mean the depot was at the docks?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The depot was at the docks, yes.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And this was plundered.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
All kinds of things were taken from the American stores.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So they would have had things like chocolate?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
That's right, yes.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This kind of thing, chocolates and sweets and all kinds of things.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000
The American troops were lavishly supplied with all kinds of things, sweets and all kinds of things.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And this was when your father was working there?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Yes.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So he would have had first hand knowledge of it?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Oh yes, yes.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And he was the secretary you said?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
He ended up as the secretary, yes.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
During the war what did he do there?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Well, he was in a reserved occupation so he wasn't called up.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
He was, I would say, an under manager.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Right.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And he was also a home guard captain.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Oh.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So as an under manager he would have had to manage the men?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Yes.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
No, not directly, no.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
He would be involved with office work.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
There were foremen and someone who directly managed the men.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Right.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Yes.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Excellent.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Well thank you very much.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
If I can think of something else.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Right, let me know and I'll come and record it.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I'll try to think of something else, no.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Oh, what about Howard?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Howard...

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Howard Reese.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Howard Reese.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Yes.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
When did he become a policeman?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
He became a policeman, yes.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
When?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
After the war.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Oh, right.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Yes, nothing to do with the docks.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Right, thank you.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
His brother did.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
His brother Peter, he worked in the office.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
At the docks?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Yes.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
He became a pilot and was killed in an air crash after the war.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Oh dear.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Yes.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
What did Peter Reese do at the docks?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
He was in the office, office clerk.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
With your father then?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Yes.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Oh, right.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Did your father get him the job?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Yes.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Oh, very good.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Thank you.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Oh, there was also flour mills.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Flour mills?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
They imported wheat.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
From Canada?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
From Canada, yes.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
All my father's brother worked there.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Right, thank you.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Well, I'll come and record it.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Yes.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Thank you.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Thank you.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Thank you.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Thank you.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Thank you.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Thank you.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Thank you.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Thank you.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Thank you.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Thank you.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Thank you.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Thank you.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Thank you.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Thank you.
