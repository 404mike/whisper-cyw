00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Abbey here is the place where I found my wife so that's always a nice reflection.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:16.320
I used to be, well I used to go running lots at the time as well and I had been running around all

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.080
of the hills and the farms and I'd met a number of characters and of course you don't realize at the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.800
time when you join things together that I'd already met Diana's father because I used to run over the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.440
hill at Devanna and come through the farm yard there and I'd met him on the hill driving an old

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:44.160
Ferguson and he is one of my fondest memories of the village to be honest just stopping and chatting

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.960
to such a friendly person as he and had the time of day for anybody and so I'd already met her father

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.680
but there's a long story and I'll just give you the very short version how I met Diana

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.600
but I was driving down the road one day and I came up behind a little Peugeot 205 and I saw

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.360
in the the rear view mirror this beautiful pair of eyes and these big eyebrows and I just thought

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.360
wow I don't know who that is I've never seen that car or that person before so as you do in the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.920
village I popped into the happy union and I asked the person at the bar next to me who happened to

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.320
be Dai Llanon who's David Jones from Llanon and I said I've seen this little car on the road and

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.600
you don't happen to know who owns it he said oh that's my cousin that is that's Diana from

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:48.880
Devanna and he promptly gave me her phone number and I then rang her up on a Sunday

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.680
only to be told that she couldn't speak to me at that point in time because

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.040
she was had there was a service going on because there were the Methodist services there anyway

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.680
nonetheless having told me she couldn't speak to me she spent about 20 minutes chatting away

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.320
nicely to me and recounting the thing the various people we knew together we'd never met

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:19.200
um before she asked me what on earth I wanted and I then said well I'd quite like to get to know you

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.880
and another big highlight was the wedding with Diana where everyone in the village just turned

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.480
out I think there was this sense of oh thank goodness we've got Jake under wraps now he's

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.040
married to a nice girl down down the road that's a good good pairing and everyone turned out so

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.560
people outside the church it was it was brilliant and for me I went from Cross Cottage to the pub

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.240
had a had a whiskey to embrace myself and then walked back over the road to the church

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.520
and then in typical fashion Diana and myself all prepared for the whole thing because we we did it

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.760
all very locally we had the reception in the village hall we walked down to the village hall

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.000
and all the local children got a rope over the road and they which is a local tradition

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.320
and they only drop the rope if you put a pound in the bucket uh for them and so you pay a toll to

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.400
pass and then we we lined up queuing with everyone else until someone said no Jake you're meant to be

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:30.240
at the front of the queue welcoming people to go into the into the hall and um after that we then

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.560
had the um the party at Davana itself with a band in a marquee which we borrowed from the scouts in

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:45.840
Newtown uh and uh so all done on a on a shoestring absolutely fantastic and um the I bought all the

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.680
the wine for the tables here and uh there was quite a plentiful supply with John Jones and my

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.120
brother who was a barman in Leicester at the time both waitering they both went around and poured

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.320
wine and kept people well imbibed throughout but at the end there were still bottles of wine left and

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.800
people made their way from the village hall to Davana walking along the road carrying a bottle

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:16.960
of wine in one hand and just had a great time so that's a big highlight for me
