00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080
So what, where did you get married?

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.080
When?

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.080
Where?

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.080
Oh where, in the Ramada.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.080
What made you choose that place?

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.360
Accessibility and...

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.680
Yeah, they were very very helpful.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.840
The reason we decided not to go, can you remember the reason we decided not to go with the registry

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.840
of us?

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.560
I can't have him.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:41.640
It was because there was only Â£20 difference in getting married in the Ramada having everything

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.720
all under one roof and by the time you paid for taxis to get the chairs back into and

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.920
everybody because there was a couple of guests in wheelchairs as well and we just decided

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.200
in the end that it wasn't worth it.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.960
That it was just easier to stay there the night before.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.920
They were very very good, they came here because just before the wedding was when I lost my

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.920
care.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:20.160
So a lot of people down to your suit and the wedding rings and even the Ramada themselves,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.400
the flowers, they all came here.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.320
The lady that did the invitations, so we had a lot of support from a lot of people.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.640
Who helped you arrange all of these things?

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.480
My best friend Catherine.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.760
But I was quite shocked on how much I did myself.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.600
I surprised myself.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:50.000
But it was also the companies that helped me get there because they were so supportive.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.760
I contact them and they were really supportive and on board as well.
