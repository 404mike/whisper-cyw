00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480
Felly, mae gennym bwysau am Hermann, ac roedd yna un o'r cyllid cyllid yng Nghymru,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.240
o Osio Osmond, a'i gweithwyr, gweithwyr, gweithwyr, a'i gweithwyr cymdeithasol.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.400
A roedd yn dda, nid oedd yn dda, roedd yn dda, ymlaen, ymlaen, ymlaen, ymlaen.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.840
Ac yn y blaen, yn y blaen, mae'n dda, a'r bwyd yw,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.560
un camera dan nifer ym misuaeth y transparent, joseph Hermann o gorau ei hunain fywyd ym P patientswar gweithred y 1911,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.600
fel ein math o arr strangers yn ystod ein造ig buridod y 1940au a'r 50au.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.360
Y stydd rydyn nhw'n cofod mille fel y mifications bennaf o Shelter.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.480
Na, dwhanfrof efo imi lyniadwy, roeddwn i yn dweud, well beth fyddwydτικio joseph Hermann?

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.680
Felly roeddwn i'n dweud, why don't I do it in sort of set myself for questions?

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.800
Right, sort of tidying my mind a bit.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.720
And starting off, and then, well, who was Joseph Herman?

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.520
Right? Birth, family, he was born in 1911,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.680
and he was a Jewish-Polish artist who was remembered for his depictions

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.840
in the Welsh mining community in Estegdanais.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.640
He was born in Warsaw, Poland, in January 1911.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.320
The eldest of three children, they were very, very poor,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.360
he went to school until the age of 12,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.120
and then later became an apprentice printer.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:40.200
He attended the Warsaw School of Art, what I gleaned, from 1930 to 1932,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.320
and exhibited for the first time in Warsaw in 1932.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.520
Now, Warsaw at that time and Poland was very anti-Semitic.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.800
Very, very, you know, the Germans and the Nazis didn't invent anti-Semitism.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.160
No, it was rife in Poland, and particularly in Warsaw.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:08.200
So in 1938, that's a year before the outbreak of the Second World War,

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.280
at the age of 27, he fled Poland for Belgium

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.360
because there was a mountain of anti-Semitism in Poland.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.440
And of course, as I said, this is prior to the outbreak of the...

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.320
one year before the outbreak of World War II.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:33.160
The following year, the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939, and the war broke out.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.600
Well, he was in Belgium now,

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.040
and he rather liked the expressionist artist of Belgium.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.800
He was in Brussels, actually.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:51.040
Rather than that, in other words, he thought intellectual artists

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.840
of Paris, the impressionists.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.720
So he was allowed to be in Belgium.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.800
And there was one story that he says he liked the police in Brussels.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.840
He said he would walk the streets and talk to the police, and they were rude.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.920
He would have stayed in Belgium, actually.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.760
But of course, the following year, anti-40 Nazi Germany invaded Belgium,

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.480
and so he had to flee again, and he fled through France.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.160
And he had a good luck, because he was travelling through France.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.600
Travelling from somewhere called June...

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.440
June, July...

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.760
June, July...

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.600
Oh, very odd name.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.960
June, July Rice, I think her name was.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.240
An American gave him a lift as far as Bordeaux,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.640
and in Bordeaux, he heard that there were ships going from La Rochelle to Canada

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.360
for members of the Polish army who had fled Poland to join the British army.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.560
So he actually got on that ship, but it was obvious that he wasn't a soldier.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.880
But he thought it was first...

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.200
He was misled and thought it was going to Canada, but he ended up in Liverpool.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.680
The words of a soldier went for the army, the British army,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.280
but he was told to report to the consul in Glasgow,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.000
so he got a hitchhiked to Glasgow.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.960
So he was in Glasgow in 1940, and there was quite a number of refugees there,

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.640
and quite a number, actually, of Jewish refugees.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.080
And they had even met up with an old friend,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.960
a younger uncle, Adla.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.320
I'm so sorry, his Jewish name's hopelessly...

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.760
Difficult, yes.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.720
Adla, and he's quite a famous artist, and he knew him in Warsaw.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.440
So he became very friendly with him.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.120
He taught a bit of art, he exhibited in Edinburgh,

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.240
and there he met Katriona MacLeod.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.960
She was an heiress from the Isle of Skye.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.280
She liked his art, she followed him to Glasgow,

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.680
persuaded him to take her as a student,

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.040
but he wouldn't, but he eventually married her.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:17.360
So he was married in 1943, I think, to Katriona MacLeod.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.360
But before that, actually, in 1942,

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.560
he had heard from the British Red Cross that all his family,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.560
every member of his family had been destroyed

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.720
in the Holocaust.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.320
The Jews in Warsaw had been herded into a ghetto,

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.560
and in the ghetto, they were then persuaded after a while,

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.640
look, we'll take you to a camp, but they didn't know what a camp was.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.720
But fortunately, he thought it was a...

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.360
Fortunately, they didn't get to Auschwitz,

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.560
but they were cast in the vans.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.640
All his family.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.600
I can't believe these things.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.840
There was no one. He was the only survivor.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.960
They were all murdered.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.840
He was a dissented man because he had a very, very bad breakdown,

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.240
and Adlaen lived through that.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.560
And then, as I said, he later, just a year later,

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.400
he married Katriona, Katriona,

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.000
he's called her Katriona, which I've just forgotten.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.160
And they went to London.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.480
Now Katriona was pregnant in London,

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.360
and there was a lot of bombing, because what type?

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.440
So he was advised now to come to Wales

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.840
by a friend called David Martin,

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.160
who also was very friendly with David Alexander Williams,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.520
a carpenter in a scheduling colony.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.600
Now, it's very difficult for me at first to sort of to reconcile this.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:00.240
How come that a carpenter working in a scheduling colony

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:06.160
was also a friend of David Martin?

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.480
Who is David Martin?

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.240
He was a journalist.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.160
He already met Herman in Glasgow

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.400
because he worked for the Daily Express in Glasgow.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.400
So he was Jewish.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.440
So I thought David Martin is not a Jewish name.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.800
I discovered, because I'm nauseous,

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.680
I discovered that he, I was intrigued by it actually,

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.560
David Martin was Ludwig Denzel.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.960
I'm mispronouncing that, I can tell you.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.800
And born in Budapest, but educated in Berlin,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.560
but a whole family got out of Europe,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.160
and his parents went to London,

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.640
and he left Berlin in 1934 to Israel,

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.120
and then he was with the International Brigade

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.800
and the Spanish Civil War.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.840
So he was, but he was a writer.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.200
He came to London.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.840
How did a writer who was Jewish

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.840
become friendly with David Alexander Williams?

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.840
It may be because they shared left-wing politics.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.800
It may be because he was a writer,

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.560
and David Alexander Williams became quite well known

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.920
as a short story writer.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.880
Much of his work was published.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:30.000
So David Martin, of course, wrote Tiger Bay,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.280
the book Tiger Bay, and had come to us to recognise.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.880
I know in his biography he mentions that he stayed

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.880
with David Alexander Williams,

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.680
and his friend Peggy, Dialect, we called him,

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.120
in Otfellow Street, David Martin had.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.880
So I had a contact with David, I made the connection,

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.800
David Martin had told Joseph Herman,

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.280
we'll go to Wales, we'll be quiet.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.440
You like the people of Wales.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.000
And that's how it all began,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.280
that he came to a Scottish.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.880
But he met Dialect in Brecon,

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.520
and this is what he says actually,

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.880
doesn't know how he came to Brecon,

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.400
but in his own words.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.600
My Scottish wife, Tationa, was pregnant and needed,

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.080
so the doctor said, to get away from Walthon, London,

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.000
and get some restful nights.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.080
A journalist friend, David Martin,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.560
just back from Wales, suggested that we go there.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.600
I cannot say how or why we arrived in Brecon.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.680
Brecon at that time was as noisy as Piccadilly Circus.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.080
American soldiers and girls and laughter

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.640
from the small hours each night.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.440
Then on our first night arrived unexpectedly in Otfell,

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.080
a strange visitor, a carpenter.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.360
Who worked in a connery was also a short story writer,

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.040
Dy Alex Williams.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.600
He arrived with his blonde and friendly wife, Peggy.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.400
Apparently my London friend wrote to Dy Alex,

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.880
told him about our well-abouts,

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.480
and asked him to get in touch with us.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.520
So, I think I've told you all about David Martin now,

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.320
who was the link between the two.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.560
And really, I suppose that this time I should make another connection

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.080
before I say where he came to win in Astran,

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.160
and that is the connection inside a village.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.200
Now Dy Alex had been the liaison.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.600
Dy Alex now, a short story writer, carpenter.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.840
Colerty, right?

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:56.000
He'd also been the liaison via the miners federation

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.200
with the Czech government in London,

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.520
the Czech legation.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.200
Arranging some sort of,

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.200
and arranging for them,

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.200
they're bringing together the villagers and miners in Cwmgyedd

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.240
to do a re-enactment of literacy.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.240
So he doesn't feature in the film,

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.680
but he was the link,

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.920
and with Humphrey Jennings, the director.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.600
So the link between the three, getting them together.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.800
So he was very passionate about the side of the village.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.160
Very proud of the villagers, it isn't bad.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.440
So he had told David Martin about it,

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.080
you know, many, many times.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.400
David Martin was also intrigued by the whole thing,

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.240
being Jewish.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:50.640
And David Martin told Joseph Herman the story,

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.240
the side of the village.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.200
When again Joseph Herman met with Dy Alex,

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.560
he also told him again about the side of the village.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.880
So he was very keen to come to the village,

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.600
to come to Estrikenais for several reasons,

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.440
and that's one of the reasons actually,

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.960
because he had known beforehand of the story of the side of the village.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.600
There's the connection again, a connection, right?

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.800
And that connection is Dy Alex bringing Joseph Herman here,

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.280
and Dy Alex being the liaison or the contact between the groups.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.040
Byard actually, Dy Francis in the Miners Federation

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.000
asked him to do that.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:35.840
So he's in Estrikenais,

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:41.200
so he comes first of all to stay with David Pecky in Arford Street,

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.280
two up, two down, or one up, one down.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.800
It was very, very small, no bathroom or anything.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.200
Catriona was an heiress actually,

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.480
from a very, very rich whiskey family in the highland sky.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.720
I say that once he came,

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:06.240
he was so happy that he was welcomed by everyone,

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.680
and he has supposedly said,

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.840
allegedly, I haven't seen this written down,

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.520
but I heard that he said,

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.880
I do not have to explain my life to these people,

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.320
because they know.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.640
But people after the making of the side of the village were very,

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.800
especially in Miners, very anti-fascist.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.520
And he was also, but it's in the book that he said,

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.200
I found all that I required.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.920
So he stayed with Peck and Dave,

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.520
we call them Peck and Dave, right?

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.200
Dy Alex and his wife,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.200
for about three weeks.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.920
And then he decided to stay,

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.520
and he moved to the Pennebott, Pennebott Inn.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.560
The Hodges were the landlords,

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.840
Roy Hodges and his wife.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.480
Is it Hodges? Hodges, sorry.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.280
I'm not quite sure.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.240
In the Pennebott, and they rented

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.960
a living room, a bedroom, and a ballroom.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.200
John asked me if they did in the ballroom,

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.480
but he painted there.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.880
And while they were there,

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.480
they were there for about 18 months before

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.680
they decided, the Hodges decided to move

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.040
and go farming.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.160
And they became quite friendly at that time,

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.840
and he didn't want to stay there,

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.480
they didn't want to stay there with new landlords.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.200
But while they were there,

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.880
he painted in oil, Katria, his wife,

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.240
and that portrait is still there.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.440
It's now with the National Library in Aberystwyth.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.800
He also painted three,

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.880
or drew, painted one and drew,

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.160
three characters who featured

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.120
in the sign of village.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.680
And he did that when he was in the Pennebott.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.440
If you've seen the sign of village,

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.720
they really are very striking.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.840
Yes, I have seen it.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:02.720
You've seen it, you know,

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.960
there was a Llew North, we called him,

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.080
his name was Llew Chords,

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.360
but he was from the North,

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.200
and was known as Llew North.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.120
Very charismatic, the three that do it.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.120
Then there was Henry John Williams,

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.720
and Henry John Williams,

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.040
his drawing of Henry John Williams

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.240
is in a private collection in Estred.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.480
And then Sid Bowen, another one,

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.000
a very, as I say, very striking looking,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.120
very Hollywood looking,

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.760
considering there were no professional actors

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.600
in the film, astounding.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.280
And that drawing is also in a private collection

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:46.640
in Estred.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:48.880
And those were,

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.040
not what you would expect Joseph Herman to have done,

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:59.680
because we see his art as monuments,

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.920
in a sense, to something.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.360
So this is before his method changed.

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.880
So these three portraits were most definitely done

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.800
when he was in the Pennebott.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.480
Then up on the side of the Pennebott,

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.120
you can see out in two,

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.600
what was then called Goff Buildings,

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.160
now called Rested Vowr,

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.760
and he saw Nestling in the Weeds, I always say,

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.000
an old pop factory.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.120
It was not a news, I think, it was a storage.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.400
And Catrier bought the old pop factory

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:42.960
and they converted it into a dwelling, of course,

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.320
and a studio for each,

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:48.480
because Catrier was also an artist, Catrier Herman.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.160
She was quite a flamboyant and lively character, actually.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.800
In her own right, she was quite startling.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:02.960
And very friendly and loved as strict and nice.

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:08.560
So they settled there, and it's there in the studio,

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.880
they remained until 1955,

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.520
and their marriage broke up,

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.120
and they went their different ways,

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.600
and that was 1955.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.960
And the time, the studio was built

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.400
by a builder, Islwyn Thomas,

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.880
and also a lot of the carpentry work

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.360
and the fish pond was done by the Roberts Brothers,

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.400
Dai Roberts in particular,

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:43.360
and his wife, Nancy, was there every day as a companion.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.920
And so that Carole, Carole Roberts, Carole Rouser,

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.640
do you know her?

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.880
She was more or less brought up there,

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.960
so I always say if people want to know

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.720
exactly what went on in the studio,

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.880
who came there, who were their friends, etc.,

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.680
they would only have to ask Carole.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.760
She lives in Cardiff,

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:11.200
and she knows quite a lot about their lives in the studio,

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.000
and particularly Catrier, she was very well fond of Catrier.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.400
Catrier, as I said, was quite a personality.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.080
She loved children,

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.920
and she had organised on one occasion

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.920
the children of the building, Leicester Fowl now,

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.800
to perform Cinderella.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.280
And we tried to track down the cast, actually.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.040
Cinderella was merely his,

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.400
since she now lives in Washington.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.760
So just difficult to track down.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.320
To have a re-enactment of Cinderella

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.880
with everybody being very much older,

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.320
very, very.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:53.200
And Carole, she was the musical director.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.480
She was a very good pianist.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.680
So she was very lively, very colourful.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.880
I know she made for me,

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.880
because I lived on a farm from the end,

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.280
she made for me a marionette,

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.720
a little puppet theatre.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.920
I played with,

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.760
I was an only child as well,

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.760
and I played until it collapsed.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.480
So she was very friendly,

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.960
and she loved Mr. Gullness.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.440
He immersed himself in life here.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.520
He came to the Melfer Hall

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.520
for one of the concerts.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:30.640
He was chair of the choir,

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.120
the Mr. Gullness Mewroch Choir,

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.000
which at that time,

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.480
rehearsed and performed at Melfer Hall.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.680
He had many friends.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.640
He had Leo Morgan, the photographer,

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.040
T.J. Davies, the photographer.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.400
Dianna and Peggy,

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.560
they went to London in 1950,

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.120
because from a captain in the mines,

00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:01.280
he became then an exhibition officer

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.160
for the newly formed National Court Board.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.120
I lived in London.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.960
That was a leap, I know.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.280
So they went up close from there on,

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.240
about that time on.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.080
T.J. Davies, Leo Morgan,

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.600
Menna Gully,

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.040
she was a very big friend of Herman,

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.880
and Herman painted her in the nude.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.000
And that also is in a private collection

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.960
in Ystrak-an-Lest.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.200
Oh, there are some really lovely stories,

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.960
but I can't tell them, actually.

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.080
Naughty stories, really, about him.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.040
He was very naughty.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.200
Very lively, very naughty.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.420
Yes.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.680
We'll leave it at that.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.200
We'll leave it at that.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.120
But she left in 1949,

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.000
because her husband,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:46.880
who was a lecturer,

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.000
philosopher in Swansea,

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.280
went to lecture in Keele University,

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.200
and from Keele to Ulster,

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.080
and much later on to Cambridge,

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.320
where she then met up with Joseph Herman

00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.840
when he was living in Suffolk.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.920
So they were lifelong friends.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.200
She wrote many novels,

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.920
and she was fearless.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.520
Very interesting, Talita.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.800
So it would be lovely if you could

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.920
have many artist friends there,

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:14.240
you know,

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.240
Mary Falk is another

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.120
woman artist.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.120
She came to the studio

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.680
and remained a lifelong friend.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.600
People who were politically motivated.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.560
It was a very politicised time, actually.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.060
Yes.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.920
So many of them would be

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:36.880
from the left wing.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.920
Diana himself had been a member

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.840
of the Communist Party

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.120
until the 1950s,

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:49.200
and the Soviet invasion of Hungary,

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.400
and then he came out of the Communist Party.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.560
So people who were very, very left wing.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.920
Another big friend of his was Jim Lewis.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.440
He was a lovely chap.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.680
He had shopped Jim on the square

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.920
in his Gendwin arms.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.520
That area was called the square,

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.760
and it was very important for

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.800
protests and things

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.640
throughout the 20th century.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.960
Well, big protests always there.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.600
I know that.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.100
The square.

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.120
I've heard something there now.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:19.620
Yeah.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.160
I want to have something to

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.400
to get people to remember that.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.800
A bench or a plaque would say something,

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:27.300
you know.

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:27.800
Yeah.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.080
And it was seriously just called Red Square.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.040
Because Jim himself was very left wing

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.360
in the shop.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.120
Shopped Jim Bach.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.360
So there was Jim,

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.640
there was Llew,

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.600
TJ Davis,

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.520
and lots more.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.960
Everybody seemed to welcome him

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.480
back to Port of the Welfare Hall.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.920
Also they had many visitors

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.440
or Carol Rosa tells me,

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.720
many visitors who were

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:02.640
Jewish artists and writers.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.400
One in particular, Martin Bloch.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.400
Also,

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.400
Chlediwr,

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.920
but from Silesia,

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.680
from Poland or Hungary.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.280
So she in part could fill you in

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.760
about lots of those intellectuals,

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:20.260
really,

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.680
who gathered in the studio.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.200
It was a very lively place.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.240
It was very fair.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.640
Now, why did he stay?

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.200
Well, you know,

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.520
I think I answered that as a question

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.880
I put as well to my son.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.920
Why did he stay?

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.600
Well, one would be friendships.

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.960
The way that he actually,

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.920
they did embrace

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.480
and immerse themselves in village life.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.440
But another thing I think is most important

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.240
is the time.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.840
It is a time of, say, 1945

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.760
of post-war optimism.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.960
A rebirth, as he himself called it,

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.080
a rebirth.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.680
It is the time of the

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.240
newly formed

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.600
National Health Service, NHS.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.000
It was the active government.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.160
The welfare state.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.360
So you had a lot of joy,

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.880
a lot of looking forward to

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:19.600
a new order, shall we say,

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.720
a new time.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.800
So there was that optimism.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.480
There was the friendship.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.400
And so it was time.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.120
He was in the, as were Roberts,

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:29.840
and then,

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.320
Bill Roberts is quite a well-known Welsh artist

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.000
from Neath.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:35.280
All right?

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.000
And he was a very good friend as well.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.120
Sir Leifold, another good friend.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.120
And Will Roberts said, well, yes,

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.840
he was here at the right time,

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.200
in the right place,

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.240
at the right time.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.320
And I thought that was, well,

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.680
when you really have to examine the time

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.280
to understand that, you know.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.920
And how everybody celebrated this,

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.560
you know, this new order.

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.320
Order, yeah, a new era.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.280
A new era.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.560
Didn't have to be seen again.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.800
So I covered where he lived.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.320
Not at finish and say,

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.040
well, what did he think of us?

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.440
Many, many,

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.920
many, many books written about him, actually.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.040
And things like that.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.680
Well, in 1946, really,

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.360
when he came to Britain,

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.960
he spoke six languages.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.480
But when he came to Britain,

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.360
he didn't speak English,

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.960
but he picked it up very quickly.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.120
Not, he said, Welsh is too difficult, he said.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.200
Part is six, he wrote in the Welsh review.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.160
And I'll just take it.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.640
X class, that was called,

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.600
the mining village.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.760
And in his own words,

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.440
the mining village differs from others I know.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.360
First of all, in its colour,

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.120
violet roofs at the foot of green hills,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.520
pyramids of black tips surrounded by cloud,

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.320
by trees the colour of dark bottles.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.680
When the sun appears and gills the air,

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.360
the streets otherwise,

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.840
only from grey, become copper brown.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.640
There you are,

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.120
said a man with a soft voice of secrecy to me.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.240
Such is life, yeah, mostly grey,

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.640
but there's also a drop of gold.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.560
For weeks I wandered here in the hills,

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.520
in the little streets,

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.360
looking at the landscape,

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.840
looking at walls and at men,

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.440
at pits from far and near,

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.640
sketching and talking to miners

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.560
on the surface and on the ground,

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.560
at work and at rest,

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:47.760
studying their movements

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.120
and their appearance.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.160
The miner is a man of a strickeness.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.080
In his appearance on the workforce site

00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:58.960
like other workers,

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.640
the miner is more impressive and singular.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:08.400
Sometimes I thought of old Egyptian carvings

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.880
walking between sky and earth,

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.560
or of dark locks fashioned into glorious human shapes,

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.040
or of heavy logs in which a primitive hand

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:24.640
had tried to synthesise the pride of human labour,

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:29.920
and a calm force which promises to guard its dignity.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.680
It would be true to say that the miner

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.800
is a walking monument to labour.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.000
Now what's extraordinary that he could write like that,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:42.960
so poetically,

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.000
and in short the time.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.920
I say because his visits to the strickeness library

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:50.720
in the mine as well.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.760
Oh, he used to like to visit as well.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.880
I forgot about the two I should have finished there,

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.320
that when he was in the studio,

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.600
he painted the parlours for the Festival of Britain,

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:08.160
for the pavilion of islands minerals,

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:08.720
it is called,

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.720
the Festival of Britain 1951,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.280
which made him quite famous,

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.600
they were huge and it became quite famous.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.600
Can I say something quickly about

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.280
obviously the Joseph Herman Foundation

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.320
to put onto the edge,

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:20.960
yes, yes.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.400
Just to say how his heritage then is being,

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.280
is being preserved and remembered in the area to this day.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.400
I can't show you any person,

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.280
and I'll tell you,

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.040
people used to say to me,

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.440
and by that time I owned the studio,

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.800
because Diana bought the studio

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.840
when he was living in London,

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.280
so I had a home here as well,

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.080
and I inherited the studio.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:47.840
So people used to say,

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.440
and I knew,

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.040
I knew of course I was in Portis,

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.520
but I didn't think of doing anything,

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.720
but people said,

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.200
well, you know,

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.800
people must recognise and realise

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.400
just as significant this is,

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:03.360
well, I could see significance as 20th century,

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.480
mid-20th century,

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.760
just like the sign of village,

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.600
two events in town,

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.960
which would get interested.

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.840
So I'm talking to Anne about it,

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.360
when we were walking along the street,

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.560
from the cross actually,

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.560
right up to the welfare hall.

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.960
Now Anne and I were both on the board

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.160
of the Miners Welfare Hall,

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.240
and I said,

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.440
I don't know what to do,

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.240
I don't join,

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.360
just because John Marley,

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.280
listen to our conversation,

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.480
he added,

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.840
let's do something with children,

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:33.920
there are people.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.120
So we, let's go in and ask,

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.160
that's a good idea.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.400
So I always say,

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.160
it was all down to John Marley.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.360
And so we went,

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.560
and the hall saw wind,

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.840
and we said we should do something,

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.520
and he crossed our trains,

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.000
and he said,

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.040
yes, we should actually.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.240
I tell you what,

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:57.200
he said, I'll get an artisan residence,

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.680
and we'll find a school around here,

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.360
an artisan residence,

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.240
and we did that,

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.760
and it was Cynllais School,

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.560
it was the first school.

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.880
Schools, the names of schools

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:07.760
come out of the heart.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.320
So it was then,

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.360
I should say,

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:15.040
part of the board of the Miners Welfare Hall,

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:15.760
right?

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.400
The Miners Welfare Hall is the father.

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:21.840
Right.

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.360
It began there.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.360
So if Alan and I had just been us,

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.960
we would have been on the board of the hall.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.160
We probably would have done every school,

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.760
eventually, in Ystrak-y-Garnais.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:40.080
But wind met Caroline Davies,

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.760
who was the Arts Development Officer

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:42.720
for Swansea City.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.200
And she said,

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.960
and he told her what we were doing,

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.480
and she knew of Joseph Herman,

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.400
and she'd actually written a children's book

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
for schools on Joseph Herman.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:56.480
She said,

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.280
can we join you?

00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.280
So she brought her friend.

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.600
Oh, we found a committee,

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:02.080
sort of,

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.640
not independent of the board,

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.880
but a sort of appendage or something,

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:07.600
you know, someplace.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.120
There were board members as well.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.480
It grew, it grew.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.360
And we thought we would

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.840
sort of make it a more formal,

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.280
by 2004,

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.960
because now we were doing

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.480
schools, residencies,

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:26.320
and with Caroline Davies' help now,

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.600
Caroline Davies,

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.640
because she, as Arts Development Officer,

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.600
she had contacts with the Arts Development Officers

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.200
for Wales, Ceredigion,

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.040
Cymraedyn, Yn y Potamboedd,

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:37.540
you know.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.080
So we thought it would grow that way.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.960
So we became,

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.320
we thought we'd formalise things

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.480
and became a company limited by guarantee,

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.320
a charitable status.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.880
And so it goes on.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.880
And then we found there was some money

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:56.560
with Spirit European Funding.

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.760
We employed a project manager

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:04.000
over Agriphus for two years anyway.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.960
Then after the Blue Tate,

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:10.320
Tate Bittin contacted us.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.320
By that time, Eleanor,

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.080
Eleanor, Ylbina was involved in,

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.080
and the telephone came,

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.160
the phone came from the Tate

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.360
to the Miners Welfare Hall.

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.280
And we heard about it,

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.720
we thought it must be a joke.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:25.680
Can't possibly be true.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.840
Tate Bittin, Roedd y,

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.200
Bittin asked us to give it.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:29.700
No.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.840
No, impossible.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.120
We sat in it for two days.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.640
And we had, yeah, we tried,

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.360
you see what it is.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.080
And it was indeed Tate Bittin asked us

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.800
to get involved in this project.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.240
And we thought that took two years.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.440
And that indeed helped it to grow,

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.080
to really become different,

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:54.480
more known about.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.440
And then, when Eleanor was project manager,

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.960
wanted everything to be bilingual.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.560
I think we were producing things.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.160
We were having grants, you know,

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.760
we were always looking for grants,

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:08.260
wasn't it?

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.840
It becomes, oh, I don't know.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.760
I like breezes, I am.

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.480
So difficult.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:16.980
Yeah.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.240
But during Owen Lepis's time,

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.000
which was funded by the European Fund,

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.080
he told us about the Nationalist Devon.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.920
This would be 2007.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.480
It was a long time ago.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.920
So why not have a sponsor,

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:36.800
Dev is a Bobble,

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:37.760
just sponsor in it.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:41.120
So it's the people's choice

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.600
in Lle Celf, in the art pavilion,

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.400
it's the last day of the Nusenegwod.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.560
And they wrote it all week

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.480
and it's announced and money given.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.080
And we would raise money for it.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.040
So Anne and I,

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.080
I think we have gone all over the place.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:57.600
You have no idea.

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.720
From banks to teleconvery,

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:02.880
to the town council,

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.080
oh, and more and more.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:04.800
Give her money now,

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.160
but there's 500 prize.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.000
Well, I wrote to Rowan Williams

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.280
because I'd been in the Tate,

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.760
because before we became involved in the Tate,

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.840
Tate incentives and in the book shop.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.680
And there was an article by Rowan Williams

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.120
and his interest in art.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.080
So I thought, well, well.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.240
So I wrote to him and asked him

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.520
if he'd become a patron.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.640
I said, you don't know this.

00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:32.000
And he wrote back to me and said,

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:32.720
you honor me.

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.720
So we, now with the prizes and this,

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.320
we asked him if he would come

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.560
and give the prize.

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.240
Now we were only sponsoring.

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.120
There was a problem.

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:47.920
But he said, yes, I can.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.200
And it was in Rexhill.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.520
And he came on his own on the train.

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.880
No entourage, no security men.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.600
So for the first time then, I think,

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.720
the ice dead man took us very seriously

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.720
because we had the Archbishop of Canterbury.

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.920
Oh, and he was absolutely fantastic.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:06.560
He's a lovely man.

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:07.760
I met him a few times.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.760
It's absolutely fantastic.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:15.600
And they changed the name of the prize.

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.680
So it wasn't there was a bubble

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:21.280
sponsored or supported by Joseph Herman.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:25.920
It was the Joseph Herman Art Award.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.240
There was a bubble.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.800
So the Joseph Herman Art Award at the top.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.400
And that's thanks to Rowan Williams

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.400
setting up to give the prize.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.560
Amazing, isn't it?

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:41.760
So, you know, things like that

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.560
are things like the tit.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:52.080
They helped us to become known.
