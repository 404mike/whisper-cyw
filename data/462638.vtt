The Investiture of Prince Charles, what do you remember about that ceremony?

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.960
You're picking all my favourite subjects now, aren't you?

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.840
Yes, I remember that very well. Although I was living in London, I was very fortunate to be part

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.560
of the choir that took part in the actual ceremony in the castle and it was a great privilege

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:32.160
to belong to such a choir which comprised of members from each county of Wales plus a contingent

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:40.960
from London Welsh which made up a choir of about 200 voices. There was a lot of hard work in

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.000
learning the music because they weren't easy pieces to learn. We were staying in

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.840
Bangor University over the weekend. We rehearsed hard and we had our rehearsal

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.880
the day before in the castle and the performance on the following day. Now it was a

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:13.760
not a very nice day. It tended to have rainy showers and wind which blew the

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:22.800
panels that had graced the castle walls and made such a noise that when the television came on

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:34.320
it sort of interrupted the music which was very sad really. To my mind there was never a recording

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.440
of all the music that we sang that day and nor has it appeared on television since,

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.880
which to me is a shame. Do you remember the atmosphere in the castle that day?

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.680
Oh yes, it was very tense because of all the problems that had happened outside

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:06.320
with the various shootings that had happened in areas and it was very full of

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.400
well secret police but a lot of police around. Yes it was very tight security.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.440
Our handbags were searched as we went in and out.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.960
Yeah that was very tight security then.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.360
In the run up to the ceremony do you remember what was on television?

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.600
No not really because I'll say we came up to the university about Friday and we were

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.120
we didn't see any television then because we were so busy sort of rehearsing and

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.520
getting ready for the performance. I don't recall an awful lot on television. It's only what I've

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.920
seen on the television in later years when they've been on television for a long time.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.320
In later years when they've done special programmes and you've seen a bit of the

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.560
procession outside.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.320
You were living in London at the time was was anything organised in London do you remember?

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.960
I don't remember anything specific no.
