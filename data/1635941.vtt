00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560
roeddaf yn King's Road, yn Llanda Beir NO 1932,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.260
ym 15 ownig.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.900
Gan ni fyny yn fater pornodau settledol

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.700
40 oaru yn usagell ton y affects y Pancaid.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.980
Diolch.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.220
Ac rydych yn mynnu fy modai i ddcheisio'r Techs wrth fy mheistedd?

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:46.220
I left school at 14 and then I was in a factory in Almondford for almost a year and then I left there because it was Pullman Springfield factory making the springs of bedding.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:01:05.220
Well, they were all in coils and I was a feeder basically, they called it a feeder, just unpacking all the springs and presenting them to the ladies that crimped them up for the form of bedding.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:34.220
So I left there and I was chased off with that, I wanted to become a motor mechanic so I went then to a garage in Llandebier called Morgan Jenkins and Sons to start my apprenticeship until I went into the army at 18 and my brother and I were called up at the same time.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:56.220
My brother remained in the factory in Almondford and then he left later on and became, he passed his driving test and was a butter salesman for Harris the Butter Merchant in Llandebier.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:21.220
They were friends with Ellis the Butter Merchant in Fairbach and I went to, after coming out of the army, I joined the RSE as a RSE patrol.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:31.220
And then I, you've got me.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.220
Yes, so a RSE patrol man.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:48.220
Yes, my distance was from Llandefri all the way down to Morriston Cross and back twice a day basically.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:03:00.220
I met up with an RSE patrol man in Llandefri, just outside Llandefri towards Brecon.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:29.220
And after that then I, or later on, I worked for the steel company in Gorsaynend for a year and then I left that and then I became a bus driver then for six and a half years with South Wales Transport and Double Deckers and Single Deckers.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:39.220
I was on coach driving as well towards Blackpool and Bournemouth and different places.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:54.220
The elderly, I used to sing on the mic in the bus and the coach then and all the old age people used to enjoy it and they always used to ask for Dawn.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:18.220
And the day the dentist and his wife on the front seat next to me on my left was, I didn't have to worry about my breathing because yesterday he had a big map on his lap and he said, left you had Dawn, right you had Dawn and all the way wherever I wanted to go.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.220
He was a fantastic navigator.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.220
What's the word? A navigator, yes.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:47.220
And after that I went to, with the National Coal Board as a driver for five years later on and then I applied for a job as a foreman.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:05:05.220
I didn't think I'd get it but out of 18 drivers tried it, the general manager gave it to me and I was told, we'll break you within three months and I was a foreman for ten years.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:21.220
So I finished then after the closure of the pits and Mrs Thatcher came along and said bye bye to you all.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:31.220
I lost £12,000 then on the, I lost £12,000 wages basically but never mind.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:55.220
So after that then my mother was not very well and my parents and so between everything then I, between arthritis and other problems I had and then that was it and here I am now.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:02.220
I stayed in the TA during that time.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.220
Yes.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:12.220
It was in 1950 when you and your twin brother got called up for National Service.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:39.220
Well basically we were called up and did our training in Derring Lines in Brecon and during the career training and then we were doing some career training in Cwmgywdi at the mountain rescue places.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:07:00.220
I think I'm not sure but and then we were on draft then for career or Belize in Central America and so we were all on the main square with all the streets and bedfords.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:10.220
We were all in line picking different people up and my brother and I were by the tailboard of the lorry basically.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:23.220
The other guys were getting up onto the vehicle and we were told that you're not going, you must report to the officers mess.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:32.220
So we went up to the officers mess and that's where basically we stayed.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:38.220
We became waiters and then.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.220
What was the reason for you being called back?

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:57.220
The reason was that somebody had decided to send us up.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:06.220
I don't know who it was but unknown to myself and my brother years.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:10.220
I almost finished with the tears.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:23.220
My mother told me that she had written to the then Major Tyler who was the PMCD.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.220
It must have been prior to that.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.220
Who she'd written to I don't know.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:43.220
But to say that she'd already lost one by and I don't know her words as she didn't say.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:52.220
I was just guessing that when you look at my eyes I don't know what it was.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.220
I have no idea.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.220
I didn't know anything of this.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:09:01.220
I was quite annoyed really because I wanted to do a bit of adventure.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:07.220
Everybody was worried about where to go here and in any case.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:14.220
That's how we landed in Bracken itself.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:24.220
When we came out we had to join the TAVR, Territorial Volunteer Reserves.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.220
Army volunteers TAVR.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.220
So that was 1952?

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:36.220
1952.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:44.220
That was supposed to be for about six years or seven years.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:52.220
During that time I stayed with Fourth Welsh until that was disbanded.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:59.220
On the photograph I sent you this morning I won the driving competition.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:14.220
On the LMG pairs with the Sergeant Bill, I can't think of his name.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:25.220
He's the man in the centre behind to the right behind Colonel Tylai.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:33.220
In that photograph you see of him he was the Colonel then.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:43.220
During my time with the Fourth Welsh I was always Colonel's driver.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:49.220
Because I was an advanced motorist and they must have thought I was better than anybody else.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.220
I don't know.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.220
I don't know.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.220
Anyway I had the job.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:11:05.220
As I think I told you the other day that I was in Talfblay Plain and this.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:12.220
Ralph Tucker, Colonel Ralph Tucker, I was his driver.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.220
He said I carry on along this.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:24.220
What seemed to be like a big pudding in an area called Hangingstone Tor.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.220
It was.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.220
I said it's too much.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.220
I said it's too soft.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.220
We'll make it.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.220
He said follow me Davis.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:39.220
With that my Land Rover disappeared practically.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:46.220
All I could do in the front end of the Land Rover was down in the mud.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:54.220
I had an 18 foot aerial on the back.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.220
I tried to hand-pitch it on that.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:04.220
I had a couple of bars of Kit Kat chocolate.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:10.220
After that Remy came to tow me out.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:17.220
They got stuck by well towing me out.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:21.220
I think it became a brigade exercise.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:33.220
Anyway eventually from the Wednesday to the Friday I think I got back to one of the camps in Southbridge Bay.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.220
Another little tale for you.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:41.220
I was with Colonel Tyler.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:46.220
Then he became a brigadier later on.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:52.220
We were going across this web.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:57.220
He said go straight across this field.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:01.220
We drove straight across the field.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:09.220
Then of course we'll say the Monday after or whatever it was.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.220
He saw his mistake.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:17.220
He was standing behind me and all the boys in front.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:21.220
He said now this is what you must do.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:26.220
He said go straight across the field like that.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:42.220
He realised that somebody took the whole vehicle going across the field.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:46.220
He said you don't cross fields like that.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:54.220
You must go right round the edge and then your tracks won't be...

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.220
He was the one that was wrong.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:03.220
He cleverly thought to clear this one up.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:08.220
The camouflaging of all my vehicles.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.220
To see if we had any mistakes at all.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.220
We couldn't see any of our...

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.220
This was in RCT.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:26.220
I couldn't see any mistakes at all that I had made with my boys.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:35.220
The only thing we could see from the air was the officer's mess toilet with a Hessian right round it.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:40.220
Sticking out like a sore thumb.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:45.220
Later on of course that was shown as well.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:49.220
I took a photograph of it.

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:54.220
When I was up in the air with this helicopter.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:58.220
I took a photograph of it.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:06.220
The officers were trying to not belittle us.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:11.220
But see what mistakes we had made.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.220
They were the ones that made the mistake.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:19.220
Another little thing I used to do was stick into the toilet.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:27.220
You had to dig six foot holes with the plank across.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:32.220
You'd bump across the plank and do the rest of it.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:37.220
One fell over, the plank broke.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:41.220
They came out sinking over everything.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:48.220
Then we were called up with 224 squadron.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:58.220
I had a section of five or six vehicles.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:07.220
I'll send you another photograph of one that we pulled in the side of the road.

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:15.220
Then I decided to go right across the road into this car parking area to change drivers.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:23.220
At the start of it we were all collected together.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:29.220
We had to drive to a place called Gage.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:37.220
On the way down we must have left Carmarthen at about 7 o'clock in Cardiff.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:41.220
That was more or less midnight.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:45.220
I went to the sergeant's west end.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:49.220
They wished me a happy birthday and gave me a glass of red wine.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:53.220
That was it. Off we went.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:59.220
I'd like it not to be known as Gage in Royal Air Force place.

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:07.220
We drove down into what was an underground arm and step over.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:13.220
It was full of everything there.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:19.220
There were rows and rows of ambulances, motorbikes and so forth.

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:25.220
We dropped the sides of the vehicles and loaded them up.

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:34.220
We started off down towards Marchwood in Southampton.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:49.220
On the way down I stopped and had the vehicles in a formation of readiness to turn right into the car park.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:57.220
All of a sudden we were shunted from behind by this big arctic vehicle.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:04.220
There were three or four vehicles.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:07.220
Bang, bang, bang.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:12.220
I think three or four vehicles.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:19.220
I think I showed you the photo.

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:31.220
I took those photographs while the boys were giving the police reports.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:37.220
I went back to the lorry itself.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:41.220
The little boy was in...

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:45.220
I know later on he had a broken leg.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:51.220
I put him in my sleeping bag to give him a warm one and then off we went to the ambulance.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:19:07.220
There was a helicopter above and other vehicles came and transferred the ammunition to other vehicles and off they went.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:20.220
Then we went on to the emptying of the vehicles area.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:28.220
I think it must have gone on to the Hermes or the Atlantic Coveya.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:37.220
I think it was the Atlantic Coveya because the Hermes was in Plymouth.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.220
I'm not sure.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:53.220
On the way down, prior to leaving the depot, when we picked up the ammunition,

00:19:54.220 --> 00:20:02.220
we wrote on it, from 2 to 4 Squadron, with love to the President,

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:06.220
love from 3 to 4 Squadron.

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:18.220
That little message, I don't think got there basically because it must have been sunk with the Atlantic Coveya.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:27.220
We came back then and then I climbed Snowdon,

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:35.220
before that is climbed Snowdon with the boys 4 times.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:40.220
Did I send you that photo?

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:41.220
No.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:49.220
I sent you that one after. We were all on top of Snowdon, which was quite good.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:57.220
Being silly rather than clever, we all ran down instead of...

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:04.220
I was a lot better than I am now. I couldn't do it now. I can't walk across the blanket road.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:07.220
That's just where I live now.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:17.220
I was on standby to pick up a rocket of some kind from Milford Avon,

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:21.220
and to take it up to Ross Scrythe in Scotland.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:29.220
I was on standby and all this happened in about 12 days basically.

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:35.220
But the fault comes to an end then basically.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:40.220
It was all stood down and we all attended with us.

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:55.220
While this vehicle that was commandeered, it was a civilian vehicle, a Volvo F10 it was.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:22:03.220
I was supposed to have driven that one, and I think because there was a police car there as well,

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:11.220
I was hoping that he'd be in front because I wouldn't know the way to go up there.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:15.220
And then he gets without maps and all that.

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:19.220
Don, are you a Welsh speaker by any chance?

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:26.220
No, my parents were English and we spoke English.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:35.220
Another little story, my friend was a vet and he was in the German veterinary corps.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:43.220
But he was stationed in... he had a practice in Llanfairfechon in North Wales.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.220
He used to live in Llanfairfechon.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.220
Did you?

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:51.220
I worked in Llanfairfechon in a hospital there I believe to not.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.220
Well, well.

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.220
That was when I was young, I was only about 20 then.

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.220
You know, 21, 22.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:04.220
Well, he had a practice in Llanfairfechon.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:11.220
Going from the sea road adjacent to the centre of Llanfairfechon,

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:17.220
it was on the right, almost before you got to the wooded area on the left.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.220
Right.

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:26.220
And anyway, we were in this... you say, did I speak Welsh?

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:36.220
And my friend was attending to a cow with a big glove on his right hand,

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:39.220
so you can guess the rest.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:43.220
And the farmer said, do you speak Welsh?

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:46.220
And I said, no, but I can understand it.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.220
He said, there's nothing clever about that.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:52.220
He said, I've got a dog at home that can do that.

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:57.220
Is there anything else that you would like to add?

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:02.220
Any other stories or anything?

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:08.220
Have you seen the Days of Hope?

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.220
Yes.

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.220
Well...

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:14.220
That was with you, that was the First World War.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.220
Yes, that's right.

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.220
That's right, yes, no, I have seen it.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:27.220
Well, how that came about was all the boys were in the barracks in Cymraeddyn,

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:34.220
and this film crew turned up, and they wanted everybody...

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:41.220
They'd already been to 223 Scorton in Swansea,

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:48.220
and they came to us to ask for extras for the film.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:55.220
So they said, some of you will have to get haircuts,

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:58.220
and I said, well, I don't mind having a haircut,

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.220
I said, because I haven't got much left in any case,

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:05.220
but I'm not shaving my moustache off.

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:10.220
And you see, as you are, we've got a job for you.

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:17.220
So they promoted me suddenly to a captain,

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:24.220
and all the officers proper, including our favourite sergeant major,

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:28.220
into private soldiers.

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:38.220
We're down in Pembroke, Lanyan Barracks in Pembroke Dock,

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:46.220
and I was dressed as an army officer, captain,

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:56.220
and the owner of the car was my driver in the picture,

00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:03.220
and on the right hand side was, on my left hand side in the picture was two soldiers.

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:10.220
The nearest one to me was, then sergeant Westfold,

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:23.220
and the other gentleman was sergeant...

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:28.220
I can't think of his name just a second.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:41.220
But anyway, the picture was, it looked as if I was just stepping into the car.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:47.220
The car was a Swift, and it was owned by the chauffeur himself.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:53.220
Somebody, he lives in Pembroke somewhere, I don't know.

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:58.220
And so that was the story of that.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:05.220
And when I was fitting for the jacket,

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:13.220
the jacket had been worn by David Niven,

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:23.220
and the hat that I had was worn by Steptoe and son,

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.220
son, Harry H Colbert.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.220
They had their names inside it.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:35.220
I thought for the next wearer, I put my name on it as well.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:50.220
My name was put forward to drive a Land Rover in the rally called Black Dragon.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:28:01.220
During that time, my navigator was then Second Lieutenant David Morris,

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:18.220
and we started the rally in Abergavenny army depot there.

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:24.220
We had to drive up as far as Chester,

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:32.220
and come all the way back down then to Sunnybridge.

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:46.220
And then we had to, it was about 154 miles over distance,

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:49.220
but I won it outright.

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:59.220
There was, I think, about 135 Land Rovers trying.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:12.220
It was previously won a couple of years before by the Royal Military Police.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:20.220
Then it was the following year or two, it was won by the Gurkhas,

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:25.220
and then it was finally won by me.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:29.220
And Lieutenant Morris was a good navigator.
