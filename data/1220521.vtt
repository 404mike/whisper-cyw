00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
Can you tell me a bit more about Habonim then? How it was organised and what you did?

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.200
Well, Habonim was largely, it was Zionist.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.600
We basically were all for the State of Israel, the kibbutz movement,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.600
because it was left-wing without being Marxist.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.400
There were different forms of Jewish movements.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:34.200
There was an extreme left-wing Marxist group, Hashomer HaTzaiyya,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.200
Watchmen of the Night. They were extreme left-wing.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.200
Habonim, the word bon-er in Hebrew is builder.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.200
The prefix ha is the definite article, and im at the end of a word is the plural.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.800
So, Habonim is the builders.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.400
What are they building? They're building Eretz Israel, a land which would be for all Jews.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:10.200
And interestingly, Zionism was the result, as Simon Schama said only recently,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.600
the result of antisemitism. Not the cause of it.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.400
Many people today think that because of Israel and Zionism, people are antisemitic.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.200
Not true. Antisemitism, in my view, is a bit like fox hunting.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.200
It's fun. Kill a Jew. It's great fun.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.800
Particularly at Easter time, you know, when the Passover and Easter relate.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.400
So, Zionism as such was the key element of Habonim,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.800
but there was a great emphasis upon Israeli folk tunes and dancing, Israeli dancing,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:02.200
and play-acting and scouting, because we did a lot of camping and trekking and that sort of thing.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.600
It was influential in a big time.
