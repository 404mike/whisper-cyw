00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
The main trade here, as you can imagine, they were the name of that fish cart, the main trade was fish.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.320
There was an awful lot of fish landed here. Fish was kippered, fish was preserved in salt,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.640
sent all over the country. They even had a trade as far as Russia, I believe, who did salt fish.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:24.720
So it was a busy little port. And there was a lot of smuggling went on. And the smuggling was

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.520
quite mundane in the sense that they were smuggling salt, because you had to pay a big

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.760
tax on salt. So there was salt smuggling going on. And also lots of other things were smuggled.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.880
You'd only have to look at the map and you've got things like Brandy Cove,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.480
Gin Cove. You can imagine what was being put into those coves. Booze from Europe, wine.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:56.480
But the official business was really just fish. But anybody traveling down this coastline had to

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.800
have somewhere to hide if the weather got bad. Imagine a ship that doesn't have an engine.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.200
It's reliant on the weather. So you needed somewhere you could duck into and get out of

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.840
the weather if the weather turned bad. And traditionally, you have the headland of St. David's

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.920
and you've got the Octopatorum. The Romans knew about St. David's. The old map mentioned by

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.640
Pliny, Ptolemy's map, the Marksdown Fish Guard and the headland of St. David's. St. David's headland

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.120
was called Octopatorum, the eight perils. And so that the eight perils was eight reefs, big reefs,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:38.960
reefs outside of St. David's. So to get around that headland was a big job. And particularly

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.200
in a sailing boat, because you don't know on which way the wind was blowing, which way the tide was

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.160
going. The easiest way of describing it is to say you had to come up on the tide. You had to wait

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.480
until the tide was right and the weather was right before you get around that headland.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.000
And the first place you came to where you could hide out of bad weather if the weather turned

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.520
nasty, which it does, as you know, quite well in Wales, was Fish Guard. And Fish Guard Harbor was

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.920
a good place to come in. Even if you weren't trading in fish, say you were trading in timber

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.240
or you were trading in any other product, you'd come into the harbor to hide from the weather and

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.520
you'd pay harbor duty. You'd pay harbor duty to come in to hide in the harbor for a couple of days

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.920
and then pass on out. And at the same time, you'd be buying local products.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.880
It was a good place to be. It made money.
