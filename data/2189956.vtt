00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
I'm Vicki MacDonald and I'm in Holy Trinity Church, Llandudno, as part of the Longest Yarn.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:13.400
And I'm now going to speak to Nigel Morgan because he's going to tell me a story about his father during the war.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.700
Thank you, Nigel. Thank you very much indeed.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.100
Not a problem at all, Vicki. Nice to meet you.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:26.400
I'm just showing Vicki a photograph of my dad, which was taken in Dieppe, in France, not long after D-Day, after they landed.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.400
So, this is my dad, Hugh Morgan.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:39.500
He was 19 years old when he made the unimaginable journey from his roots in Blenifest-Inyog to the battlefields in France on D-Day June 1944,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.100
with his band of brothers that were the RASC, the Royal Army Service Corps.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.000
I remember him telling me stories of when him and some of his mates were in a bomb crater moving forward towards the enemy lines.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
At one point in the battle, him and some of his friends advanced the next crater.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.100
And as they jumped for safety into the next muddle, the one he had just left was hit with a mortar round,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:09.200
killing all his friends that just a few short minutes before he had been alongside, he counted himself very lucky.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.800
He never called himself a hero, but he was always a hero to me.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.700
In fact, I'm just having his medals re-ribboned by James Malins, who's a local Army Cadet captain,

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.100
and they're going to be completed by the end of this month.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.800
In fact, I've just only just picked them up.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.800
And when I was sorting out the medals, I found out some of his paperwork from when he was in the Army,

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:41.200
realized he was part of the RASC, had a quick look at trying to do some research into where they fitted into everything.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.300
I looked on the Imperial War Museum and I found the actual, the RASC were part of the landing party.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.100
They were part of, normally, they're part of D-Day landings, which I never really knew before.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.400
So it was new to me and it was a huge honor.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.500
And I'm very disappointed that over the years, I never got to speak to my dad more about this.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.600
I wish I'd have known.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.900
But in order to pay homage to my dad, I've now got his medals re-ribboned.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:20.800
And this year, I'm hoping to be able to honor my father's memory and his service by wearing his medals proudly on Remembrance Day.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.200
Lest we forget.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.900
Oh, thank you, Nigel. That was a lovely memory.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.000
And yes, you will be able to wear them on your left side.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
On my right side, yeah.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.300
On your right side, I wear my father's.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.500
I will, yeah. So I'm looking forward to it. I've literally only just got them.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.100
How many did he get?

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.100
He got four.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.700
And he was in the police, so he's got a long service medal as well.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.900
So I've got three medals from a tide.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.700
And so I've had them redone.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.200
On the old ribbons, I've had them done into a small band of ribbons.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:05.900
So yesterday, I was in the fortunate position to be able to pass them on to my sister as a gift, which obviously she was very moved by.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.400
So he survived the war and he came back.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:21.100
So did he, do you think that when he was in Dieppe that he joined the rest of the forces on their way to Caen and Baer?

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.800
Did he?

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.400
Yeah, well, I was looking at the Imperial War Museum records.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.000
The RAC backed the British and the Canadian troops when they landed at Arremont.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.200
And I remember him telling me stories about Arremont.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.500
And I never took enough notice.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:48.400
And I think this is where maybe my generation missed out and we never really sat properly and listened and appreciated.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.300
I don't think they wanted to talk.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.100
He didn't.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.100
And he never did.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.700
It used to come out every now and again.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.500
He used to drop in the odd this and the odd that, but he never really spoke about it properly.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.500
The only incident I think he spoke about was the bomb crater incident.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.300
Oh, until he realized how fortunate he was.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.500
How lucky he was.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:13.100
But how desperate also the fact that his comrades who were very important to the men at the time were killed.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.500
And he must have been really, really upset and shattered.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.900
Really.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:29.700
And my dad was a real hard man, a proper rough hard man, smoker, drinker, fighter, and from the hills in Blaenaufist in Jogh.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.900
But every Remembrance Sunday is the only time I think I ever saw him cry.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.500
And that's the time he used to recap the odd story.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.500
And so we used to pick up on little memories such as that.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.000
And that was only on Remembrance Sunday.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.700
And that's the only time I really ever saw my dad moved and cry was on Remembrance Day.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.000
And that's when those little stories used to come out.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.800
I just wish I'd listened more.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.800
But hopefully now moving forward, we can show him the appreciation that he deserved.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.400
Thank you, Nigel, very much.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.900
It's a pleasure.
