My name is Joke Overdeverst. I came to live here in Wales 22 years ago.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I live in Roschfach and my place is called Brynhefryd, which means beautiful or excellent views really.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And I have that. The views are amazing.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I was looking for a place to live and we did think probably land with an old house and build it up slowly.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I wanted to milk goats. But when I did ask somebody who had goats here about was there anything he didn't like about goats,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:56.000
he told me this horrible story about if baby goats are boys, you have to sort of kill them straight away because nobody wants to eat goat meat.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And I said, well, you know, can you do does the fat come?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Or he said, no, actually not really. He gets a piece of wood and he actually kills them.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We were in such a shock that I said, oh, no, no, we're not going to do that.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We're not going to be never can do that. And my one of my daughters sat on that time.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But mama, we still going to live here. And I said, well, I don't know Joyce, her name was Joyce.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Could you do that? And she sort of said, oh, well, as long as I don't get nightmares, she said.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
But anyway, we never did that. So that was a bit of a shame because it was a bit of my dream as well.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
But we lived a fantastic and one day we went out on the bike and we went.
