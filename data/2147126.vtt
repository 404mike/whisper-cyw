00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
My name is Farzana and I was born in Pakistan, in Faisalabad.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now in English as well. My name is Farzana and I was born in Pakistan.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Where in Pakistan were you born?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I was born in Punjab, in a small town, Tomatek Singh.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
My father, when he finished his job, he came to Faisalabad.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
He lived there, he bought the shop before he was in the army.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:11.000
When he finished in the army, he bought the shop and stayed near Faisalabad, near Tomatek Singh.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I was born there, and my brothers were born there. We lived our whole life over there, in Tomatek Singh.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I have a sixth brother, only sister. I was very, very spoiled.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I always played with the boys. I do play with the girls as well, but more with the boys, because in the house it's all boys.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I was in the middle. I was four older and two younger brothers. I was in the middle, so I just always played with the boys.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I have a very happy childhood. I have an education in Tomatek Singh as well.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Because in our house, education is more important than anything else.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000
What type of games did you play?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:40.000
No girly games. I don't know the name or anything, but whatever the boys were playing, I just went and joined them and played with them.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:56.000
They always called me Tom Boy. My eyes were always watering. I'm not a crime or anything.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I did education up to GCSE in Pakistan. As soon as I finished my education, I got married. Even the result came after I got married.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:24.000
My husband and I went from here to Pakistan. It was an arranged marriage.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:33.000
We got married and he came over and I didn't come with him because I didn't have a visa.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:47.000
They always give us 18 months to apply and then they give us a visa. After 18 months, he went back and I came here.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
What would you say is your favourite memory about childhood and also school?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.000
School. I had a very good time in school.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:17.000
My aunt built the school. She didn't have any children. She built the school and all the first children were us.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000
My cousins were very nice because my nephews and nieces all lived in one area and we stuck at the school.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
After that, we were still there.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:50.000
My cousins were older. I don't know how to explain it. It was very easy in school. I'm not very good with English.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:58.000
English is terrible.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:12.000
What was that experience like being married and waiting for your results?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I didn't even know what marriage was. I was living with my father in a different area.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000
My parents were living in Tobadak. It was quite distant.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.000
They found us. He came to our house and they found us. Someone told us that they were young girls.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:49.000
They arranged it. I didn't even know what marriage was because nobody told me.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.000
I have an older brother and none of them got married at that age.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000
When I got married, I knew a little bit what marriage was like.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:14.000
It was a different experience but my husband is very nice and gentle. He's a very good man.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.000
He's a very big guy. He's of a different age. He said, don't worry, I'll look after you.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
So here I am.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Is that the time you came to the UK? When did you come to the UK?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I came to the UK in 1976. When I came here, he didn't have any homes.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
He was living with his uncle.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:51.000
After two or three weeks, he said, let's go to Scotland for a holiday.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
My sister and I went there. He said, I'll just go for a holiday.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
We went there and she said, stay here, don't go.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Because I was living alone in this big island by myself. It's an Oasis.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I said, who said this? Because we didn't have any homes, he said, stay with me.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
We stayed with her for about three months.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
After that, they had a small house. Nobody used it.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:27.000
We just got up. It's one bedroom, like a small place.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.000
We moved in, in that house. After that, we just stayed there.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Life is very different when I moved up there.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Because the people didn't have bathroom facilities.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
They used a portable toilet.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
They didn't even have a carpet or anything.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
They used sand.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
They cleaned it every six months.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Like sand, take off.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
On Sundays, you can't go out.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
They just go to the church, worship.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.000
But no housework, you can't put the washing out or anything.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
They use a peat for burning.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.000
They buy a lot in the summertime and they cut it into blocks.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
They rent the land for six months and cut the peat.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
They can bake blocks and dry it and use it for the winter time.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
We did that as well.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Once or twice a week, the barn came for the grocery.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Because there was no shop, nothing.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Fresh milk is alright because the people keep the animals.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
For the milk, eggs and potatoes, these things are alright.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
But the rest of the stuff, the barn came down and we moved by grocery.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Then my first child born over there.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
We got the house.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
He started working on the building side.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000
For a few months, I think, he didn't like it.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Then he started doing the business door to door, selling stuff.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Because my brother-in-law, he's doing the door to door business.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Take the stuff and go door to door and sell the stuff.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
He started doing that.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
We stayed about six years over there.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
My children were born on that island.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
It's a different experience as well.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
It's nice.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
But if you have to go to the hospital, you have to go to the bail land.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
That's in Glasgow.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
You have to catch the flight or the ship.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
No other transport.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
No train, no bus, nothing.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
On the weekends, nothing.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
You can't go out.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
If you want to go to the bail land, just five days.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
That's a different experience for me.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:44.000
We stayed there about six years after my youngest son was born.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
He was alright before when he was born.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:55.000
After six or eight months, then we noticed that he's not all there.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
But we still stayed there about three years.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
They said if he starts school, we have to send him to the bail land.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I can't send him to the bail land because in the hostel or whatever they sent him.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
So I asked my son, let's go back to Newport.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So one summer we just came down here.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
We didn't bring our stuff.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
We just came down to see his brother lives here.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
We just came down to see them.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
We stayed with them for about three months and applied for the house.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Then after he brought the stuff, the council gave us the house.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
We moved in and we were together.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I don't like the idea of sending the youngest one to the hostel or whatever they want to send him.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:08.000
So then they take him to the school every day.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I know I'm sending him to school and he comes home in the night.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
I was with him all the time.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
It's alright then.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:25.000
But I don't like the idea because wherever he's going, I have to be there.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:33.000
What would you say was the most important thing that you had to leave behind?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
How did you feel about it?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
So leave behind one in Pakistan and also in Scotland.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Pakistan is a family.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
All the family, my brother, everyone.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Good memories.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
In Scotland, it's a different experience.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Which I haven't seen in Pakistan either because we have all the facilities in Pakistan.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
When I came down here, the first time I saw the sea as well.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
The sea is over there as well, but I haven't seen it.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
That's different.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
When I came to Newport, that's another different story.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
What year then did you come to Newport?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
We came down here in 1983.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Since then, we just sit in Newport now.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
We moved three also.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
We moved around in Newport, but still in Newport.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
We're not going anywhere.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
My daughter lives in London.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
She said, come down here because only three of us are living here.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
My husband's passed away.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
She said, come down here.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
We'll be all together.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
I said, no, I'm happy here in Newport.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
It's a nice, cozy place.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
I don't want to leave by all these friends.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
I'm like age-alive.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Other groups I go.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Every day I go out and enjoy myself, see my friends, have a good time.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Seeing them and talking to them is nice to me.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
It's different like staying home and all that.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
I want to work all my life.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
They always call me Lady Leisure.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
I said, okay, yes.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:50.000
What do you remember or recall about the first few days or few months that you were in Newport?

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
It was very different.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
When I came here, I think it was April or May.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
What I don't remember is March.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
It's snowing.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
One week after, it's snowing.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
It's so different.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
It's cold.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
I was young.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
I didn't feel cold.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Now I feel cold.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
But everything is different.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:24.000
The way the people live.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
How do I explain it?

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
And no family here.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
It's very isolated as well.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
It's like staying in.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Only one or two people I know.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
I can go and see them.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Otherwise, not many people.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
If the people are there, but I don't know them.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Only one or two people I know.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Just go and see them.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Just busy with the children.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:08.000
I spend most of the time with my children.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Give more time to them.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
When they're not there, they're in school.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Then I go out and see my friends.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Otherwise, no.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Since they're gone, educated and doing their work.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
I was so depressed.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Because my children, my daughters, my boys, they're like friends to me as well.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
When they're gone, I was so depressed.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000
I joined one group like Asiana.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
A long time ago.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
15 years ago, I think.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
I joined that group.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
From there, I see more and more people.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
I know them and make friends with them.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Then start going out.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
I join lots of groups now.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
I can't stay home now.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
I'm so bad.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
How has that been?

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Growing more friends and connections in Newport?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
I was very, very shy before.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
When I was in Pakistan, I was different.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
When I came there, I was quiet.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
I didn't say much.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Since I'm coming to this age-line group,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
I see this friend.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000
I go out more and talk more.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
I think more socializing now.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Meeting all different backdrop people as well.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
It's fascinating.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
It's like asking them where you're from.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
All sorts of different stories.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
I really enjoy them.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
I think not any bad now.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
With Pakistan, what do you miss the most about?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Most of all, my family.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:36.000
I came here 20 years after.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
I can't travel every day.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
I went back five years after.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
To take my children home and show them.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
When they start schooling, I can't go.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
I go by myself.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
I leave them here with my husband.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
I see them because I have to see my mom and dad.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
I still go.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
I just go by myself.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
I still miss them.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
They're gone now.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
My brother is still there.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
They're living in different parts of the country.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Still in Pakistan.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
They're in different places.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
They said, you're most welcome.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Come down anytime.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
You don't have to be parents.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
You can come stay with us.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
I just go and stay with them for six weeks.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
What do you love the most about your culture?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.000
We are more disciplined.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.000
We respect our elders.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.000
We're quite sharing people.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.000
We share.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
I think I mix up quite quickly as well.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000
I'm not very religious, but I do pray five times.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000
With that, not so much about the religious aspect,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
but even so the religious aspect and the traditions,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000
what part of your culture have you made an effort to preserve or to keep?

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Keep praying.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
I wasn't praying before.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Since we opened, I started praying five times before.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Whenever I have the time, I just pray.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Since we're locked in, I do it regularly.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
If I don't do it, I miss it.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Then I always ask forgiveness to God.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
I think that's it.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Telling the children as well, pray.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Be good to other people.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Just tell them to respect.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.000
If you respect somebody, they respect you back.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
If you don't respect anybody, they don't respect you back.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
That's the first thing you tell them.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
My children do everything to me now.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Sorry.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Speaking about respect, is that something that you felt came straight away from being in Age Alive?

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
That they respected you and then you were able to give your respect back?

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
No.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Speaking about respect, do you feel that Age Alive is something that they brought to you?

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Is it the fact that they respected you?

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
He's not going to stop.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.000
When I joined the group, oh dear, sorry about that.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
I don't know how to turn it off, okay?

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:38.000
You might just say, because I really just answered, just say, oh God, can you believe that?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:47.000
When I came to Age Alive, we have a whole different background people.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
We're only a few of us Asian in that group.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
We have English and Jamaican and all other.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
We're quite a mixed group.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
We enjoy each other's company as well.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Like we have our elders, like Vanessa and all that, they always speak to us very nicely.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
They help us as well.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000
She always asks us if we see us down.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000
She always asks, what's wrong?

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
That's help as well.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Roy is very good.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
We help each other.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:56.000
I always tell them, just tell me what you want and I help you.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
I do anything for anybody.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:11.000
I always ahead of them to do something like helping, not gaining anything, just to help them.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
How do you think Age Alive, actually more so,

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:31.000
when you think about your time in Age Alive, is there one event or two, is there moments that really stand out?

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.000
First time we did a play with Roy.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000
I was talking too much now.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Before I was very quiet and shy, sitting in the one corner and don't say anything.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Roy said, no, you come and join us with this play.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
I said, no, I'm not joining. I can't.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
In front of all these people, I said, no, you can't do it.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
He helped me. He said, come on, you can't do it.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:15.000
First time I did the play in a pill some way.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
I was so scared after the play.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
I always feel so happy I did that.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:34.000
And sometime when we did quite a few times singing as well, that's how I enjoyed it.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:46.000
How do you think Age Alive supports black, Asian or other ethnic groups?

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:54.000
How do you think Age Alive supports black or Asian or other ethnic groups?

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
I think it's helped me. I don't know about the other people.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
I really enjoyed it.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000
As long as Age Alive is there, I'll be there.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
If I don't come one week, I miss them.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
I miss the company, miss everything.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Even if we don't edit, we just sit and gossip.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
I enjoyed it.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
While I was on holiday, I was thinking about the Age Alive.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.000
It's a lovely group.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Because there are all different ethnic people as well.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
I enjoy the company.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
I don't know, I just enjoy the company.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000
Have you kept any family heirlooms, like photographs or ornaments?

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
No.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Because I moved a lot, so I didn't keep any.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
I should, but I didn't.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Now somebody told me to just write down the stories wherever I go.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
I was thinking I should write it down.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
I didn't have anything.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Just photographs, that's all.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Mostly children.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Thank you very much.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Sorry, I was crying.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:38.000
I was telling Yasmin, did you know when I talk, my tears, the doctor said you don't blink.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Your eyes get dry and it starts watering.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
That's what happened to me.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Any good?

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Fantastic.
