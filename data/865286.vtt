00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Lord, know that those who were at the death of Clewellyn,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
found in the most secret part of his body,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
some small things which we have seen,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
among the other things,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
there was a treasonable letter disguised by false names,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and that you may be warned,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
we send a copy of the letter to the Bishop of Bath,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and the letter itself, Edmund Mortimer has,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
with Clewellyn's privy seal,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and these things you may have at your pleasure,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and this we send to warn you,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and not that anyone should be troubled for it,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and we pray that no one may suffer death or mutilation

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
in consequence of our information,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and that what we send you may be secret.
