00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.260
This is part of a series of recollections, memories, stories about Tiger Bay, Cardiff

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:25.060
Docks, Bute Town, that area that has generated so much wealth and culture for Cardiff and

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.060
Wales.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:35.060
Firstly let us say thank you here from HDA for the contribution of Heritage Lottery Wales

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.740
that's enabled us to undertake this short project.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:46.860
Let's stop for a moment and think about horse racing, which you may think has nothing to

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.980
do with the docks.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.220
Well, in horse racing, bloodlines are everything.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.500
A good bloodline can make a horse worth millions.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.820
Research in 2005 showed that virtually all half a million of the world's thoroughbred

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:15.820
racehorses are descended from 28 ancestors born in the 18th and 19th centuries and up

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:24.900
to 95% of male thoroughbreds can be traced back to just one stallion, that was the Dali

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.060
Arabian born in 1700.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.940
So in horse racing just three stallions are said to be the founding fathers of all modern

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.980
day thoroughbred bloodlines.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:45.500
The first was Bayerly Turk, followed by Dali Arabian and Godolphin Arabian.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.780
All three were imported into Britain.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.700
What does that have to do with Tiger Bay?

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:01.700
Well, Tiger Bay does not have an Arabian desert, but it certainly has enough people from Arab

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.420
countries, Yemen, Sudan, Djibouti, etc.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.500
But it has sporting bloodlines that have made Welsh history, driven Welsh pride and made

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.980
sing the names of those black mixed race descendants of the bay.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.860
Not just black, let me be clear, and not just mixed race.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.860
Consider a Jamaican man born in 1876 who got on board a merchant ship and ended up in Cardiff

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.020
Docks.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.460
His name was Uriah Erskine.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.300
He settled in Cardiff and had children.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:46.300
Two of his grandsons were the boxer Joe Erskine who won the British heavyweight title in 1956

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.300
in the main stadium in Cardiff.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.300
Then he won the British Empire Commonwealth title in 1967, beating Henry Cooper.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.460
Another of Uriah's grandsons was Johnny Freeman.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.180
Because of racism in Rugby Union in Wales, Johnny was to change codes from Rugby Union

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.740
and play rugby league for Halifax.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.940
He still holds the record for the highest number of tries scored in a single season

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.140
for Halifax.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.020
48 tries in 1956-1957.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.700
He represented Wales.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.140
Both Joe Erskine and Johnny Freeman were born in 1934.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:39.140
Both were born in Tiger Bay Bute Town and both have families still living locally.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.500
Maybe bloodlines can be measured by the school you went to.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.500
South Church Street School, for example, the school of Bute Town has a long list of sporting

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.260
icons that studied there.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Such as Colin Dixon, Bute Town boy that ended up playing for Halifax alongside Johnny Freeman

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.740
Colin was his captain.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:09.740
He also played for Salford and Hull Kingston Rovers and Wales.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.380
Also William John Boston from 7 Angelina Street.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.500
Four doors from Joe Erskine in number 11.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.700
Also born in 1934.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.900
He went to South Church Street School.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.500
He played rugby league for Wigan, Blackpool and Great Britain.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.620
He scored a record 478 tries for Wigan.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:36.020
It is said that he went north in part because he wanted to play for Cardiff Rugby Football

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.220
Club and knew in the end no black player was going to play for them.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.380
And then there was Gus Risman born in Sophia Street.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.540
Went to South Church Street School before moving to Barry.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.060
He played for Workington and Great Britain and has a street named after him in Salford

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.300
and Workington.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.340
Now Gus had two sons who went into rugby league.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:06.340
Bev who was an England and British Lion international and John, former Workington player and Welsh

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.180
international.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.540
Johnny Freeman, Joe Erskine, Dennis Brown, the Wales Rugby League international and many

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.020
others went to South Church Street.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.900
These are Bute Town names.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:27.900
Tiger Bay names and there are many others with family links to Bute Town, to the bay.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.020
Such as Lewis Reese Zamit.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.620
The fact of the matter is it's a small place.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:43.620
A place with a big heart but hard working working class people who also made a massive

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.620
contribution to Wales.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:54.620
Through sport certainly but also through many many other endeavours.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:02.620
So if bloodlines are relevant in horse racing why aren't they recognised in terms of people

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.620
and their contribution to the country they became citizens of?

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.620
.
