00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
Where was the date? What was the...

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.120
The 9th of September.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.600
Brilliant.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.080
Did you... 1992.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.480
Did you ask Di to go somewhere special with you?

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.160
Was there an outing?

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.000
Well, there you go. Good lucks.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.880
Thank you. Yes.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.600
What about you, Di? Why attracted you to Chris?

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.440
I can't... He gave me his good lucks and his friendliness.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.440
And we'd been on a thing...

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.360
In a lesson with Mr Kendall on a holiday and travel.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.040
Holiday and travel.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.040
That's how we got to know each other on holiday and travel.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.840
Oh, that was the...

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.840
I can help you.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.600
Er...

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.240
That was on the, erm... flat sites.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.600
Flat... Is it on a... flat?

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.440
It was... I think it was outside.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.600
Yes, it was outside Garda.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.600
Hmm. Yeah. Outside Garda, which is down...

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.280
He was living in Garda then.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.480
You go down here and turn that way and there's a few lards.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.360
It doesn't... We don't own it anymore.
