00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Yn ymwneud, roedd y cyfnod yn 1843.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Rwy'n gweld y cyfnod yma'n dda'r ddaeth, yn y ffyrdd o amser, oherwydd yna'r edrych.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Roedd y cyfnod wedi'i ddryllu yn y ddaeth.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Roedd y cyfnod yn ddaeth yna.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Roeddent yn ddaeth, roeddent yn mynd i'w ddweud, roeddent yn ddaeth yn ei hunain,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
yn y ddaeth.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Roeddent yn ddaeth.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Dyna'r unrhyw beth, Walty. Yw'r labiau yma, y gynllunau.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Roedd gennym nhw yn y ffynod yn Pencysysen.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Roedd gennym, y gai, y cyfnod yma, roedd yn cael ymlaen,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
yn y ddaeth fel hyn, a'r gai yn y ddaeth roedd yn cael y cyfnod yma.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Roeddwn i'n dweud y ddaeth y ddaeth roedd yn cael ddwy bobl i'w ddwylo.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Mae'r ddau cyfnodau ysgol, dwi ddim yn gwybod, oherwydd roeddwn yn cael gridd o'r manwl a phethau.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Ond roedd y pethau'n cael y pethau'n cael y manwl, roedd yn cael y ddaeth.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
A oes y pethau'n cael y pethau'n cael y manwl?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Roedd yn meddwl bod'r metod yn, well, yn y ddaeth yma, yn y ddaeth yma.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Roeddwn i'n fawr iawn o'r ffordd, ond roedd yna pan oedd yn ymwneud ym Mawrstyr.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Roeddwn i'n ysbwyso yn y bwt, roeddwn i'n cael fy siwr.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Roeddwn i'n ymwneud yn y nastyl. Roeddwn i'n cael sno yn y ffordd, roeddwn i'n fawr iawn o'r bwt.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Roeddwn i'n cael sno yn y bwt.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Yn ymwneud â phan o'r pethau'n ystodol.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Roeddwn i'n cael sno yn y bwt.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Roeddwn i'n cael sno yn y bwt.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Roeddwn i'n cael sno yn y bwt.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Beth oedd yn dweud fel hynny?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Roeddwn i'n cael sno yn y bwt.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Roeddwn i'n cael sno yn y bwt yn fwy fwyaf oedd oedd o'n ddaeth yn ddaeth.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.660
Gweithiwch o'r oed gwnplis hwn?

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.040
Roedd wedi cael y lwlau 70 oed, a bynogol ei alkod a godda hwn

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.160
ac ar hyn mae'n bing yn dvaeth,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.000
transgender yn JSاips yn y pastur.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.960
Yr wy朋友, sawl yology Bod yn anglo lies,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.040
ond yn mas4 fan, arrow hay,

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.000
a rhoedd hi wedi cael Fel.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.960
Felly her apus.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.960
Mae'r blod o metol yn y ffordd o'r glof.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.960
Do you remember your asbestos gloves? Asbestos aprons? Asbestos spats?

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.960
Do you want to have another brew?

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.960
I don't know why I'm looking for that film of Arthur on the tilt table.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.960
1973, Health and Safety.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.960
Arthur got three video flex houses, big collar,

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.960
and the only thing you had to protect you didn't have are gloves and boots.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.960
We didn't have goggles or anything, castings.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.960
You had to be quick on your feet didn't you?

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.960
Thick services, sweat cloth, gloves.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.960
Not even up until the end?

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.960
No, no.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.960
We do, I can't even say they could be a hindrance sometime as well.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.960
When we used to make these plates, the first thing you'd do was watch.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.960
When that even stopped shimmering, you'd see sand over the top.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.960
You were standing what? Three feet? Two?

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.960
And the further you were trying to throw it, your clothes would be wet, you'd get a smoke.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.960
And you'd be...

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.960
And you'd be...

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.960
You see, Arthur, there's something else that you said there.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.960
When the metal stopped shimmering, you'd be tapping out to the cupola as what, 1,500?

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.960
No, not quite that, was it?

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.960
1,400 recently.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.960
Tapping out, 1,400.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.960
You're casting out, but you're looking at the colour of the metal as you're casting.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.960
When the top stopped moving, you'd serve sand on.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.960
Just so thinly, that would stop the...

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.960
The way the holes formed in the top.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.960
And then, once it had set properly, you would cover it completely with about three inches of sand.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.960
That would stop your warping.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.960
You know the brown manhorns you see in the rope?

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:09.960
Yes.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.960
Most of the ones out here have got tailors' funnery on this, what we used to make.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.960
But in the rope itself, there was a frame.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.960
You've got the disc about that wide and that deep depth.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.960
Then you've got a frame about that size, with a flange on it like that.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.960
Then you've got the thing that fits the agility.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.960
Then you've got six bars coming up to support, if you like.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.960
We used to cast them upside down so that the top end was the flat bit.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.960
You were saying that if you didn't put the stuff on it, the sand on it, you'd have little pits.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.960
It'd go out like a volcano.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.960
And it'd be no good.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.960
Some of them did slip by the inspection.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.960
That was Mr. Tailor, that'll do.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.960
Turn it upside down, not the other way around.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.960
Then we used to dip them in tar, stop them on a stick.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.960
We had the tar barrel up there, it was an old tank.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.960
We used to put the three-legged crane in the foundation pentasizing.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.960
We used to have a chain, we used to dip the frame we've got in there,

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.960
and leave it in there for a few seconds when it was hot.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.960
Then we left it up and let it drain.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.960
One of the lads did one day knock the ratchet.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.960
He said, you're going in slowly like that anyway.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.960
The tar emptied, emptied over a quarter of the tank of tar all over everywhere else.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.960
The old chap from the end, I said, Berman's dad, he turned it across.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.960
What are you trying to do, lad?

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.960
I said, oh, the ratchet just went.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.960
He said, oh, look at that sheep in the corner there.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.960
The fence used to go right up to the scrap where we used to have the scrap.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.960
There was a sheep there with a big blob of tar on its backside.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.960
Of course, by the time it had cooled down, it was stuck.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.960
This poor little sheep was running about in this big blob of tar.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.960
They had the crane catted and they cut the wool off it.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.960
I've asked you this question before and I need to make a note of it.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.960
We know that in the Glasswood Valley there is a scene.
