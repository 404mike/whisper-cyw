00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The police, charging people on horsebacks, up in Ogilvie, up in Yorkshire obviously.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Scargill leading the miners, threw it onto me like, you know, I believed and trusted the guy.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
He never wavered one way or the other. Everything he said from day one, you know, he still maintains today.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Today, a lot of people have other political views. We all know about Thatcher, we all know about MacGregor,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the way they were portrayed on television.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But she's probably one of the most hated women in the world for what she did.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
She destroyed our communities, and such, and we were on different parts of South Wales,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
you know, the former coal mining communities, you know, there's nothing there.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You take this valley now, the biggest employer in the Rhondda bach is Ferndale Comprehensive School.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
There's about 60 teachers there. It's the biggest employer.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
When you consider in Ferndale alone, at one time, like over a thousand men working in Ferndale,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
same in Mardie, same in Tylestown, everything is gone.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Because when you left school, there was always a job to go to in the colliery, you know, if your parents would let you go.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Certainly mine didn't, first of all. Father was dead against it because he had a bad accident in the ground,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and he obviously didn't want me to go, but I did eventually go, but he won't let me go in the ground.
