00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.000
All that is beaming, all through the night, While the weary world is sleeping, all through the night.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:40.000
On my hood, the deathly steely, Visions of delight revealing, With the pure and holy feeling, All through the night.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.000
All to me, my thoughts are journey, All through the night.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And for me, my heart is yearning, All through the night.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:23.000
No that may not life face ever, Parting will not last forever, Yet oh, that is we never, All through the night.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:32.000
All through the night.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Alright!

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:48.000
May the marlin arms be shaking, At the coaster hills are shaking,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Rallying hours o'er sea shaking, Gathering the wise.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Hark! the thousand-warriors rolling, Let all hear all hearts and tone,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Tell the marlin, get out for me, Lead them to the prize.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:23.000
When the rumble shall be, Quietly pouring down,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The golden beat of war, The tyrants and the brown wings,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:40.000
The red-wilders waving o'er ye, Ranks on ranks, all mass before ye,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Are to this we march to glory, I'll show you why.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.000
When the rumble shall be, Quietly pouring down,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.000
The golden beat of war, The tyrants and the brown wings,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The red-wilders waving o'er ye, Ranks on ranks, all mass before ye,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Are to this we march to glory, I'll show you why.
