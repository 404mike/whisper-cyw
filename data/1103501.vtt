00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I made friends quickly at Marham. Tommy and Ina, who lived almost next door, were both Irish.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
He was a fireman in the RAF regiment and they had three children.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I can't remember their names but I think the eldest girl was Alison.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Sharon and Patrick played with them all the time. They were a very friendly family and I loved their Irish accent.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
My other friend Angie, who was Italian and married to Paul, another fireman in the RAF regiment.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
She had a boy and girl about the same age as my two. Angie gave me a Christmas cake recipe.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I still have the same paper it was written on. It's my favourite and I'd used it for birthday and wedding cakes.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We both worked together until I left Marham.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Angie had been at Marham a little longer than me and she worked in a gang of land girls going around potato picking etc.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
They were all RAF wives and I eventually joined them.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We would be picked up in a large white van after dropping our children at school.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
A tractor pulling a machine would bring the potatoes to the surface and it was back breaking work for us putting them in the sacks.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It was piece work so you had to be pretty fast and it was harder still when we pulled carrots from frozen ground.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Sometimes we would also go picking strawberries and the children would come and work too.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
They would carry the little baskets to be weighed and receive their money.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I think most of the strawberries ended up in their tummies.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Our gang even went to work inside a pickled onion factory during the summer holidays.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It was convenient because there was a nursery for the children in the same building.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The civilian women didn't like us much but I was used to that by now.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000
When we weren't on the land our gang leader would always find work for us all and I especially loved working in the large plant nursery.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
There were poly tunnels everywhere and I would have to kneel on a turned over milk crate to weed inside them.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
It was very painful but also quite relaxing and I loved the smell inside the tunnels.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
They had hose pipes outside each one as there was always plenty of watering to do.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I learnt a lot about plants from the old gardeners who worked there.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
It was so fascinating to watch them grafting small apple trees.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I was given a cotoniaster cutting, one of the not so good plants they reckon,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
but I still have it now and it's thriving by my pond.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It is covered with a mass of flowers every year and the bees love it.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Angie left the gang because she had a new job cleaning the grafting club on camp.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It even had its own cinema.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
It was much better for her, she was warm and dry working inside.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Eventually she managed to get me work there and it was very handy because I could take the children into the club

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
to wait for their school to open and I was even allowed to take them to school later.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I had to have a pass to enter through the main gate.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000
They were guarded by two armed guards and I'd have to throw my bag on the floor for them to search inside it.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Patrick and Sharon thought this was great but I found it a bit scary.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
At work we would take it in turn to go to the stores to fetch clean towels etc.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and it was quite a walk across the camp.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I had done it quite often but one day I walked over to stores and thought they were something odd because the doors were locked.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.000
All of a sudden these airmen in combat kits with leaves etc. on their helmets charged out of the bushes towards me shouting,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Halt! Who goes there?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000
It even got worse because lorries came towards me full of troops and I really thought they would arrest me.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
They thought it was very amusing and I could see a few with smiles on their faces.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
When I had shown them my pass they let me go back to work.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
The girls laughed so much when I arrived back.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
They knew there was an exercise on and that the stores would be locked up.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Apparently they had all been through this so I could see the funny side in the end but I was really really scared at the time.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
One day Ray bought home a little black kitten.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Hefyd wedi bod yn cael ei chanol ac mae'n ffrindiau hefyd wedi mynd i hefyd.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Y pŵerau wedi'i ddod yn fwyaf a roedd hi'n cael ei ddod yn ymwneud â Shiba.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Sally, ein pŵer ddod, yn cael eu gofnod ac roedd nhw'n fwyaf. Sally yn gallu llwyfio eu chytanau pan oeddent.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Roeddwn yn ffwrdd iawn i ddod o'r holl ymlaen.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
We came back for a few days to Cairnws at the beginning of September 1979.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
My brother Brian married Heather Hughes on 18 September.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.000
It was great to see everyone and the children loved seeing their grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Brian and Heather were married at St Peter's Church Machynll with the reception at the Riverside Hotel.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Ymlaen i'r holl hwn yn y ddau Bryndilas Cainws.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Yna, yn y peth, roedd yn mynd i'r rôl i'r 5 ar y Bryn a mae o'n ymwneud ymlaen i'w.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Un o'r ffotwyr ffawr oedd yn cael ei ddod yn y bach o'r hotel.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Mae'n unig gyda'r 8 o'n ni.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Sian, dyna'r fater, Alison, fi, Jennifer, Ann, mam a Brian.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Yn ystod ein bod yn ystod Cainws, roeddwn yn mynd i Llanfachrwydd i weld Dai Jen a'r plant.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Roedd yn fawr iawn i'w gweld nhw.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Sian a Patrick yn eich gwell gyda'u cwzynau oherwydd nad oedd yn gweld ein hun yn dda.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Roedd yn hollol yn gwneud yn ystod ein hun, ac Jen yn ystod unrhyw babi, Laura, yn ystod yw.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Mae'r unrhyw ddau i'n sian a fi wedi mynd i Sian a Patrick i'r arfer.
