00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So what was the next step then? You went on this first date. What happened after that?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What can I think?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I think it took quite a while after that, which was about two months to come to the decision that actually...

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Yeah, we love each other, let's make this happen.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So was that a decision that you made together or was it something you talked to friends about or how did that come about for each of you?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I can't really think why you talk some loli truth.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I can't really think how it actually all came together.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Did you talk to anyone about it, either of you?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I think I remember at the time my parents were really supportive of us two together.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I think that was really nice, that first date that my mum and dad were like, wow, sorry, give me your best for this.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Really wanting it to resonate with me.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I think having supportive friends and people around you is really, really nice.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Have they met Simon before?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Yes, quite a lot. My sister had as well.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
That first date?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Yes.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So they all knew him before?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
They all knew how much I loved Simon as well, I think, from almost straight away.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
They've always been rooting, I think.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And seeing us in the Odyssey show together, I think as well, when we've got people coming to see us performing,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and seeing how much we enjoy that side of things as well, I think that's always quite nice as well.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.000
When you've got people who come to enjoy a Christmas show, suddenly you're like, oh, okay, I think...

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Odyssey brings people together all the time.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We're really close as a unit, close as friends, and it does bring people closer.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Odyssey was really helpful, because not only did I probably get to know Simon,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.000
but we've gotten to know so many people throughout the whole decade that we've been there, that we've both been there.
