00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
I remember there was one person who'd lost his children.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:13.360
I'm not sure whether he was a local minister, I'm going back in memory.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.360
And they don't know whether they talked to him but somebody had talked to him and he

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.840
was explaining obviously the devastation of his loss.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.240
He lost a couple of children and it was awful.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.760
And that brings it personally to you.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:38.840
You know, you hear figures, there are 108 or whatever it was, people had died at Aberfan.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.480
But then this man speaks about my children.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.000
I've lost my children.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.440
And lost it.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.920
Lost your children when you think they're completely safe.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.760
And you send them to school and it's the most safe environment.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.880
Absolutely, you know, they're in the school building, everything's safe and then to die.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:10.160
And the thought of the horror that those people must have felt in the last seconds of their

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:21.080
lives when they must have looked up and suddenly this mountain had moved and just engulfed

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.080
them.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.840
And it's not like a wave in the sea.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.560
You can swim out of that.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.280
This just took them and killed them.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.840
Must have been horrific.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.400
Did the coverage affect your feelings of being Welsh?

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.960
Did you see it as a Welsh tragedy?

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.960
Well in a way it was because of course South Wales or the valleys were a coal mining area

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.800
and I've come from coal mining stock, although my father was an architect, his father was

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.480
involved in the mining industry and my mother's father was a miner.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.080
So I do have background in that.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.560
Although I've never been down a mine, I never want to go down a mine and I can't understand

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.320
how people can work down a mine.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.120
It's a horrific thing to work in my view.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.880
But it is very much a Welsh thing because Wales and the mines go together really, or

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.080
South Wales and the mines do go together.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.600
And so it was a Welsh tragedy but the whole country felt it.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.280
It wasn't just Wales, the whole country and beyond felt it.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:50.200
As you say, the eye of the world was on Aberfan because it just televised.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.640
Do you think this would have had an effect on the community?

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:05.760
I think those of us who weren't involved directly, probably not.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.560
I don't know what it was like for those who were personally involved.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.480
They were probably too tied up in their own tragedy to even be concerned about what outsiders

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:26.600
viewed, how they would view the tragedy because it was so personal to them.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.320
They were living it.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.760
Everybody else was just looking at it.
