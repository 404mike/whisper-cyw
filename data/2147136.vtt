00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'll ask the questions.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So can you please just tell us your name and where and when you were born?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
My name is Jabeen. I'm born in Kampala, Uganda. That's in East Africa.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I came here in 1972 as a refugee.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Are you okay to say that in Swahili?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Yes. Swahili I can't remember all of it. I'll speak in our own language.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
My name is Jabeen. I'm born in Uganda, East Africa.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I've been a refugee for 50 years.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
When did you say you were born as well?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I was born on the 15th of September 1958.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
First section we're just going to talk about growing up outside of the UK.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
What do you remember about the area that you grew up in?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
When I was in Uganda, we came here in 1972. I used to be about 8 years old.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We used to go to school there. The schooling was different from here because we were more in primary schools.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So when we came here they put us in secondary school so that was a very big step.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Mostly we just went to school there and we had to pay fees.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
We used to celebrate independence there, all the events because all the different people,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Muslims, Hindus, Christians, we all used to go to the same school.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So if it's Christmas we go to the church and then when it's Diwali we go to the Hindu temple.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
But Muslims we used to go to the mosque and then we had all African children as well with us.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So all nationalities were together and we all grew up together.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The English was the main language there and then you could speak Swahili.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
That's the Ugandan and there's a Ugandan language as well.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
There were many different languages but the main was English.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So when I came here it was a bit easier for us.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Because you learnt how to speak English.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Yes, English was probably there.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So what was it like growing up in the house?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
We were like a big family living in a small house and we had grandparents and all that.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So we used to go and visit them.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Then we used to, like weekends we used to go to the lake side, have a picnic.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
It was nice to go to the neighbour's house, mingle with them, with their festival and all that.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So it was completely different when we came here.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
We used to go to the markets, local markets.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
What did you kind of love the most or enjoy the most about Krona?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Growing up there the weather was nice.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
We very hardly had the rain.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
In East Africa the weather was always nice.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
A lot of greenery.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
We used to go for long walks in the riverside.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It was so safe, you know.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
You didn't hear anything.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
In the end somebody kidnapped you or abused you or nothing like that.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Everything was safe.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
You could walk miles and miles in the jungle and nobody bothered you.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
The people were very friendly.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
What did you think about your childhood?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I didn't have much childhood because we went that well off.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
We were just taking easy days to come.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So it was just a simple life, but no stress.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
We just wake up in the morning, go to school half day, come home, eat and just play outside.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
No computers, no television, nothing like that.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Just people mingling together.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
What type of games did you play?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
We used to play hip hop.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
We used to have chalk and just play on the ground.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And just climb trees picking mangoes.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And just had a few toys, not much toys like we do here.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Just had a few old fashioned toys.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
We had our grandparents get them for us.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
My mum used to cook. We didn't have cookers or anything.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
We used to just help around.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
If you do the house chores, my mum used to give us money to buy sweets.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So everything we had to earn.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And hip hop, was that with the squares?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Yes, squares.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And then you would throw?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Yes, throw.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And then skipping rope we used to use and skip.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
That was just our way of, you know, because the weather was always dry.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And we just looked forward to that.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
All the children get together from the neighbourhoods.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And we just played that.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So then travelling, I was just making sure hip hop because it was the same.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Growing up in Zimbabwe, so I was exactly the same.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I was trying to remember whether we did throw the stone and then we would go.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And have hope.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
So travelling to the UK, what made you decide to come to the UK?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:27.000
In 1972, the president of Uganda gave all white people, Jews, Asians, all mixed race people,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
to leave the country within 90 days.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So all we were allowed to do is, if you have a British passport, you can come to Britain.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So in 1947, 1960, the British used to rule everything.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And then they decided, who wants to become British citizens?

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Or you can have African status.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
So my mum decided to be British, take British passport.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And my dad was Ugandan.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
So then he had a problem coming.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
So anybody with a British passport, you have to leave.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
They came and started breaking the house and kidnapping people.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Very, very rough, like a ritual regime.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And then we were all six brothers and sisters.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
So all of us came with my mum.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
So we had to catch a flight from there.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
We didn't have ticket money or anything.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:28.000
So then we had to go to the church, temples, Guru Dwaray, and get money for the tickets to come here.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
All we were allowed was 20 shillings, that's about two pounds.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And one suitcase each.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And we were little, so we didn't know what was happening.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
So we went to the airport and waited for the flight and they brought us to Heathrow.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Because we were little, we didn't understand much.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
But I remember what used to happen there, you know.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
It was getting really bad.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And then from the airport, they brought us to Heathrow.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
So in Heathrow, we had the National Front and them.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
They said they were not coming here, there were 90,000 Asians.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Because all the Jews went to Israel and all different nationalities.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
So you had a choice.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
If you are not educated, a professional doctor or anybody, you can go to Canada or America.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
But if you have more children and you are not educated or anything,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
they send you to Mexico, Peru, or Britain had to take us.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Because my mum had a passport and we were all underage.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
When we came here, it was difficult.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
But they moved us, they put us in a camp.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
The camp is where the army stays, not like camps.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Big camp.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
They took us to London, Kensington, stayed there a few days.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
They showed us all the London.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
We had a nice VIP treatment.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
But then they didn't want anybody there because there were too many Asians already there.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
All foreign people.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
So they moved us to Kensington in Warwick.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And there we stayed like a month.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And then they moved us to North Wales, Stowin.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
There was a big seaside with all the camps, army camps, big warehouses.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So we stayed there about three months.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And then they said, right, we have to move you around.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
So they sent us to Wales, Pontypridd.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And a lot of Asians didn't want to come to Wales.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
They wanted to go to big cities like Nottingham, Leicester, London.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
But the council said, no, no more Asians here because there's too many already.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Because there's all different nationalities.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
We didn't like the way the first people.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
So to rehouse 80,000 people, 100,000 people was a big job.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So they gave us a council house.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
They made sure they sent us to school.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
They gave us all the food, furniture, everything in the house.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
New, brand new council house.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So they looked after us, you know.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
But then when we were in the camp, everybody was together.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
So when we went, it was a bit lonely.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Because when we went to the school, we went to Pontypridd.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
We were the only Asians there.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Me, my sister, and my cousin.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So because the two families, they sent there.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
My uncle and his wife and his kids.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
My dad wasn't here.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
He was in Italy because he was a state place.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Red Cross took them to Italy, Naples.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
So he stayed there.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And then after a while, he came and joined us.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
So then we grew up, they went to school there.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Like I said, the education was a bit hard.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Because we come from primary school going to high school.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
So we only lived there for two, three years.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And then they said, what do you want to do?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
I wanted to be a nurse, but I didn't have any qualifications.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And then I just got a job in a supermarket.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And my sister and everybody.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And we lived there for five years.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And then we couldn't get any Asian food or anything.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
You know, halal meat or anything.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
So we moved.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
We used to go from Pontypridd to Cardiff to do shopping.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
We used to go to the cinemas there.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And we were just teenagers.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And then my dad said, it's not good staying here now.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Because you know, like growing up, there's no mosque.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Or there's no place where you can go meet somebody from your country.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
So then they moved us.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
My dad and mom moved to Cambridge, you know, Peterborough.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And we went there as well.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
But then after when I got married, I came to Newport.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
I stayed in Newport.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And I've been in Newport for the last 35 years.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Yes.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
I worked in the hospital and moved around, you know.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
So at the moment I'm a carer.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
I had to leave my job in the NHS because I had medical problems.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Yes.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And when my disabled daughter was born, I had to leave everything.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
So I'm a carer for now.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And we formed this Age of Life.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
So when, like, there's workshops and everything in Newport.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And there's a girl called Lorraine.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
She's from Caribbean.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
When she went to uni, so she was doing a project on minorities,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
black and Asian minorities.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
So she had a little workshop.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I started talking to her.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And I said, what are you doing?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
She said, I want some Asian and half Caribbean and all that.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
So I can, what would you really like?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
I said, it would be nice to have a swimming classes for women.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Because a lot of Asian women won't go to normal classes.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
So she said, oh, do you know anybody?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
I said, I asked my sister and five of us joined it.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
So now it's 30.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And then Roy came after, you know, Vanessa and Roy.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And the group is now to 30, all different nationalities.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
So it's been going for the last 18 years, I think 15 to 18 years.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
I used to go there a lot because of medical problems.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
I go now and again, you know.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So we learn a lot, you know.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
We get together with all different cultures.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Windrush, that was enjoyable.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Brings memories back from home, you know.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
So when you tell people I'm from Africa, you know,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
they say you're not, you know, dark skin or curly hair.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
My great-grandparents came from India in 1947.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And when there was a petition there, they had to move.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
So my grandfather moved to Kenya and my grandmother to Uganda.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And then my dad and mom were born there.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
They got married there.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
They introduced you, like arranged marriages there.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And a long time ago everybody used to marry into their own,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
not like now with multicultural.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
So that was experience, you know.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Five times I took my younger daughter to see which I was born.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
The school I showed her, but you can't go out in the night.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
It's very scary.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
So we went to Kenya.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
I got family there.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
We crossed the border into Uganda.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
There's nightmare.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
It's very scary in the night, you know.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And then in the border you have to, like, they stop you, you know.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
How much money you got?

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
You know, and you're scared, you know.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And then after we went, they stayed in the hotel.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
So we were there for about five days.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Then I took her to a ginger that falls.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And I told them this was my school.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
They demolished it.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
They got big, in them days they didn't have big shopping malls or anything.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
But now, you know, they built a lot of things.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
So we went there.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
But you have to take somebody who's local or the security guard.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
So we had to look at the mall and you can get,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
we missed the food there, you know, like African food.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Matoke, that's green bananas.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And over there they make it in leaves, you know.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
We had that, we had dry fish and sweet potato, cassava, yam,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
and all those things we're used to.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
But you can get it now in the supermarket.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
But that feeling, that atmosphere is not the same, you know.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Over there people didn't have much, but you see people smiling, you know.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
We're all like a big family, you know.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
It's all of our schoolmates, all from Africa, you know.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And it was sad when we had to come here.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
But because we have been through a lot, you know,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
here everything was new.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
There was a lot of isolation here.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
So I've been there like 10 years, about five, six times,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
because I'm a family there.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And I went to Uganda once.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
After 40 years being here, to see what it was like.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Everything has changed.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
The school where we went was demolished.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
And the houses, they were breaking, making into big buildings.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
There were a lot of Asians going from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
They're there now.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
They've opened shops and all that.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
But it's nice to just go there and wander around and see, you know, the greenery.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
The people over there, they all died or passed on.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
So everything was new, you know.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
When you enter Uganda, the climate is so good.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And the mud there is all like red, you know.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And the greenery is better than Kenya, you know, in Tanzania.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
That's what you miss, you know, the food and all that.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I love to go again, because we went to visit my grandparents' graveyard.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
It was in Kalolo, you know.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And there, like, it was memories, you know.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
So whoever died there couldn't come here, you know.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
They were buried there.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
So that was a nice lifetime experience, you know.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
But now I'm too old to travel, you know.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
We need a group.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
They're doing group tours, you know, if you want to go there.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
It costs a lot.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
But there are a lot of memories.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
So now it's going to be 50 years, Ugandan Asians came here.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
So they have a celebration like Windrush.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
So they all get together.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
A lot of them passed away, you know.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
So all the youngsters, they're showing films, how they came here, how they...

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Everybody was, like, young, you know.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
So if we meet somebody, they say, so you're from Uganda.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
There's a lot of...

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Most of the people are business people.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
So when they came here, they opened shops and, you know, all that.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And the ones who didn't have anything, they started from nothing.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
But, you know, when I went on holiday there, there's too many memories, you know.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Memories and all the army used to torture people.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
So they're asking people, whoever had...

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
They were to leave everything there.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Whoever got houses, businesses, they can go back.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
But it's, you know, like, you know, it's very hard to start again.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Because the children's grown up here.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
They won't be able to live there, just...

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Because over there you have to work, you know.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Yeah, when you leave your school, you have to get a job.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
You're not like here, you know, gone the door.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
So they're very strict, you know.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Yes.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
And there was well-spoken English teachers.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
So everything was in English, you know, just like here.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
So that helped a lot when we moved here.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Because a lot of people, the whole generation can't speak English.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
So it's very difficult for them, you know.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Yes.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
So if they go like...

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
I find a lot of people from...

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
We got a lot of difference, you know, people in Pakistan, Bangladesh.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
They're very different from us.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
They don't mix.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
They have their groups, you know, on communities.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
But the ones who come from Africa, they mix with everybody.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
So we're like a lost tribe.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
We don't have anybody from our country in Newport.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Like you go to London or somewhere, they have fun.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
You meet them all there.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
But then you get used to it.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
So we don't belong with the Pakistani community.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
We don't belong to the Bangladeshi community.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
So we just like...

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
You know what you call it.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
So then when coming to this group, you know, meeting more and more people,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
we went to Windrush.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
And it was nice, you know.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
They have nice people, they have nice hospitality, their food, you know,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
similar to the one we had.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
So that was really nice, you know.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
And the whole generation, how...

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
What they've been through and what they've been through

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
was worse than what we were, you know.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Like we had 90 days to get up quickly before...

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
If you don't go there...

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
When you were young, they wanted...

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
They started about...

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
What do you call it?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
You know, over there Asians don't marry black people,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
black people don't marry white people, things like that.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
But it's changed now.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
So the president said, if you stay here, you have to get married.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Because African people, they wanted that rich, you know.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
They're not that educated at that time, you know.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
And they were like...

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
All our maidens were coming and working.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
So our parents and grandparents said, you can't marry there

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
because they haven't got a job, they haven't got a house, you know.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
How are we going to adjust?

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
But a lot of people stayed back, you know.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
It was difficult, you know.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
So it was nice to come to a new country

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
because we didn't see the hardship here, you know.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
We didn't have racism or anything.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Only once in school, a boy called me Paki.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
And I didn't know what it meant.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
So my cousin said, that means, you know, they got a name, like...

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Different people got different names.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
And then you think, these people need to be educated.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
They call you Sambu or this and that, you know.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
And with them, they can't see that all people are different, you know.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
So if you're brown or black, they think, you know, they call you names.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
So there's only one way.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
So when I was little, I said, I'm not tolerating this.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
I've got a botulinity on the head.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
You know, I was going to walking up to school.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
I said, don't you ever call me that.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
So the mom comes, she says, why did you do that?

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
I said, because you call me names.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
But that time, you can't, you know, you could hit and get away with it.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
So I got away with it.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
But I haven't had any violence since, you know.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
I teach my children to be independent, strong, you know.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Make sure they have education in life, you know.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
And I said, I don't want you to be like...

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
We weren't that educated.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
So when we left school, got a job, you know, that was it.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
I wanted to be a nurse, but I found the exams very hard.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
I couldn't do general exams for nursing.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
But now I got a full-time job caring for my daughter.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
She's 27, you know, I'm showing her.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
So she's going to uni now.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Yeah, art.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
And she said, Mom, I'm so proud of myself.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
I said, keep it up.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
So she's doing art, fine arts.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
And she's really good.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
She said, Mom, people don't understand.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
I put my feelings into it.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
I took her to Africa, but the wheelchair access was really bad.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
You know, she stayed in the hotel, you know, because the roads are not...

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
But now she won't go anywhere.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
She just goes to uni and back, you know.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
I like to get involved in more things, you know.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
I said, you're a good ambassador.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
You work for Whiskey.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
You've got good stories to say.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
But she just doesn't want to, you know.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
She said, I've done my bit.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
So I try and mix her up, you know.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
So the children, I took them to Africa.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
I said, look, this is where Mom's born.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
You know, I'd love to go there, you know.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
I got a good, nice company, going to stay a few days.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Have a break, you know, because that's where history is.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
You can go to Spain, you can have sun tan, you know.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
But the main history is in Africa, you know.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Yes.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
So what people go through, what they've been through.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Yes.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
So it's a lot of memories, because my sister, she...

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
You know, Yasmin, she came in.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
She hasn't got it. She's older than me, two years.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
But she didn't think, she didn't know what happened, really.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
But I was more like, you know, out streetwise.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Found out everything was happening.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
And then Roy was writing a book.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
So he wrote some of the book, I think.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
I was a little bit worried.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
But he wrote some of the book, I think.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
About stories.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
There's a lot of projects, people come back from, you know, like refugees.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
What stories they're going to tell.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
So sometimes when I'm, you know, well, I come and say it.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
So I thought this opportunity is nice, you know.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
So there's little, like yourself, you want to ask some questions.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
I'll tell you exactly, you know.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Yes.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Thank you.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
You know, so I hope it'll be a little bit help, you know.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Yeah, I know.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
You know, like we used to walk miles and miles and miles.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
You're never scared or anything.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
But here in this country you get everything.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
But you have too much stress.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
And you haven't got the privacy, you know.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
You can't even go out in the night without being attacked, you know.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
But over there people knew each other.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
You don't be scared, you know.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Like, you know, over there, our friends were African.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
I used to go there.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
My mom used to, they boiled food on this wood, you know.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
They eat cassava and that.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
We just sat with them and ate, you know.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
But now there's more prejudice here than there used to be then.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
You know.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Because some people don't like mixing, you know.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
But this group is good so everybody gets together.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Share their story, you know.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
I think people who came from Africa, they have a lot to share, you know.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Like some people never got back from the airport.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
They weren't allowed to fly out.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Because if it's a family, they take the husbands and the sons of them.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
They kill them.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
So there's a lot of women came with no husbands and children, you know.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
So we're lucky we didn't experience that bit, you know.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
So we're lucky we didn't experience that bit, you know.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
So we're lucky we didn't experience that bit, you know.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
So when we came in to start again, it's very difficult, you know.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
But we met a lot of nice people, English people, Welsh people.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
You know, they took everywhere, showed you Tower of London.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
You will have seen it otherwise.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
You know.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
And I thought, oh, in England, people come to study and all that.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
But these days nobody's interested, you know.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
So it's good people like yourself are doing all this.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
It's a good project.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
And it educates our youngsters, say, look what we've been through.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
And you'll be something in life.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
And you'll be something in the world.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
And you'll be something in the world.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
And you'll be something in the world.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
And you'll be something in life.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Because you'll never have a second chance, you know.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Yeah.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
That's what I said, Evan.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Yeah.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Yeah, again, thank you for sharing because all your stories are so powerful.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Yeah.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
And when you're sharing and hearing what it was like at that time of the period as well.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
And why it's important to have that connection.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Yes.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
And have the wisdom and the education that comes along.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Yes.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
And you went through actually an answer, answering the questions.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Yeah.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Fantastically in the traditions, in age alive, in moving.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
Yeah, you mixed it in.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Yeah.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Moving, coming here to Newport and Pontypryd as you said as well.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
And that's a village now, it's a town.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
It used to be that small.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
There's no Asian people there.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
And you know, when they see you, they call you names.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
The way some of the people in the valleys, I find more racist.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Because when you see some problems.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
But Turchwood in Newport is multicultural, you know.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
So you can see the people in the valleys, they're more racist.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
And you can see the people in the valleys, they're more racist.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Because when you see some problems.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
And you can see in Newport is multicultural, you know.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
So you could talk to somebody from Pakistan or Bangladesh.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
They have different story.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
What we've been through.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
That's really heartwarming, you know.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Yeah, so people want to know,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
oh, this happened.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
So now, when I went to Kenya,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
it was very, very hot, about 50 degrees.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
I found it so hot.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
That I preferred winter here.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
So when I used to work in the hospital,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
I went there, I came back, I was really, really big.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
I was very normal.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
I was like, really chocolate brown.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
And they said, oh my God, do you know Kachirat, Taniswe?

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
I said, we're only human.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
So, you know,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
a lot of English people, you have to educate them, you know.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
They said, oh, you go to Hedge Barrage?

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
I said, no.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
When we came, I found my ex-partner in university.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
But what we had a big culture shock.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
But what we had a big culture shock.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
He was Pakistani,

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
and I was from Africa.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
So they don't understand

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
cultures.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
So I had to stay in.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
And I had a tough life,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
a tough marriage, you know.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
And then I had to get out of it.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Because I said, I'm a doormat.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Either I be a doormat or just go and work, study.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
And my ex-husband didn't want me to go and work.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Independent, they don't like

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
women to do that.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
But then, slowly, you know,

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
I educated my kids. I said, go for it.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Go and do something.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Try and be to different events.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
But this angel had done a lot for us, you know.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
This was so interesting.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
This year, there are more things going on for a week,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
and the old people's stories.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
And they have been through a lot, you know.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Ours is not that bad.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Compared to what they went through when they came to this country.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
So people have more opportunities now.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
And I hope that question did help.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
I didn't hear you.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Thank you very much.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
I'll cut this for you.
