WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
Yeah, and I think you've already shared about what's going to happen.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.000
Roughly, I've just told her what kind of question and what would, yeah.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Easy enough. So yeah, so I'll ask the questions and then by all means you can translate.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So we'll just ask all the questions.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So first things, can you just tell us your name, where you were born and when you were born?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
My name is...

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm a Punjabi, just like you.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Where I was born, when I was born.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
She can say it in English, but more not being very confident.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Which is fine, I'm happy with that anyway.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
My name is Zebun Nisah. I was born in Pakistan, in Faisalabad.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
My name is Zebun Nisah. I was born in Faisalabad, Pakistan. When was I born?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
1960.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
1960.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Can you tell us about what you remember on growing up and your childhood?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
When I was a child, I was told about my childhood.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
My father was in the army.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
After two years of being transferred, he had a very good childhood.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So she said my childhood was very nice. Her father was in the army.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Every two years, he was transferred to different cities and different places.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It was a nice childhood.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Very nice, very good.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We were middle class, but...

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
It's okay.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
She can actually do it.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
When she gets stuck, I'll just help.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
She can't speak Urdu.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I used to do that.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
If there's any problem, she can do it.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
My name is Zebun Nisah Ahmad.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Before, my name was Zebun Nisah Hanif.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
My father's name is Hanif.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I was born in Pakistan in 1960.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
My childhood was very, very good.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Very nice. We had a very big family.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
All the cousins played together.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We lived in one house.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Nice.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
What was it like being in different parts of the cities?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
We don't go to many different cities.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
When we had holidays, I would go to my grandmother's village.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
No, not city, village.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
It's very nice. Very nice.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
When you were in Paris, you used to go to different places.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
How was it like in different cities?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I don't remember much.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
When I went to school, it was very nice.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The first couple of weeks were no good.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
We couldn't adjust to different cities.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
But after I was 10 years old, my father...

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
He didn't do the job.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
They used to stay in Valle, but he would travel for his job.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Because we all go to school.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
In the middle of the year, they were missing school and school admissions.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
That's why he started traveling, but they settled in as a family.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
What was your favorite memory?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
The most.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
A lot of memories are very good.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:50.000
But the happiest memory is when my father left the job and we lived together.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Nice, good, I can't remember any.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I was with my friends' family.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Also, being one daughter with four brothers and the only daughter.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Any games as well?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Yes, in our culture, it's like pithu garam.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
We just put the blocks on the top and throw them with the ball.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I love games.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
When did you move to the UK?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.000
In 1979, October 7th.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
How old were you as well?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I was 18.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
What made you come over to the UK?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
I got married.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Just engagement. I married in Newport.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And you came straight to Newport?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Yes, straight to Newport.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
What was your expectations of the UK?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I think everyone is very rich in here.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
No money problem, nothing.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
But everything is different when I came.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Nice, the first day, it was very nice.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Lights, clean, everything has changed, but very nice.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
But still I left my parents, my friends, my brothers.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Very sad. I cried all 12 hours.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And then slowly it's okay.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I know it was your family, but what was another important thing that you had to leave behind?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:58.000
My friends. Very close with my friends.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Have you still been able to stay in contact?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Yes. I lost everything, my dress, my telephone.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I put on the newspaper to find them.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And I find them.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
When you got to the UK, did you travel by plane?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
By plane, yes.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
What was the best and the worst? What was the best thing about the journey?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
It is simple. Not the best or bad.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
I think about my parents and cry, that's it.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
No other thinking.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
How did you feel when you arrived?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:46.000
When I arrived, my two aunties living here, my mother's sister, they picked me up at the airport.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.000
It's good to see them, but not happy.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Why Newport?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Why Newport? Because he lives in Newport, my husband.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And he was what, working?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
He was working, yes. He was only 19. He was working in Tesco at that time.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And what can you remember about the first few weeks or months inside of Newport?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Very, very hard. I can't sleep, I can't talk, because everyone speaks English, I can't understand, I can't speak.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000
They can't understand me very, very hard. And all English people look the same.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
If I see one and the other, I think he is the same.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000
I'm not different or anything. But it's not very good, no.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000
What are the challenges, whether it was languages or...?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Shopping, shopping is very hard. Going out is very hard. Doctor, other people make the other people.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And maid, maid job?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
No, maid job. All day, all the housework.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Housework all day. In the morning, like half past five, half past six, and twelve o'clock night.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Did any of your friends or family join you in Newport?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Two years after my brother came here. And friends, Raheela, first friend from Pakistan.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
We don't see each other much, but we still know we are here.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Yes.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And just to maintain the links, what did you do to kind of remember?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Sorry, sorry. No, no, don't worry.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000
I think he left the country and went to India.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
He stayed hard, but he stayed alive.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Very, very true actually.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000
I was thinking we should run away. Me, my sister, Yasmin, and maybe Surya Devas.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Sorry.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
That's alright, don't apologize.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I think sometimes it's good actually. I cry sometimes, oh my god, in my own time.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And I see that, you know, when you introduce me, I, you know, it's still...

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Now I can see, you know, why I'm here. You know, when I've done the work, apart from that, if I'm honest, we just survive.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Because we can't do anything for ourselves, just for other people, all the time.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Make them happy. Nobody thinks about me.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
She needs the space or happiness or anything.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:15.000
I didn't go six years, I didn't see my parents. After six and a half years, I go first time.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Would you say that it was your culture that kept you strong or kept you connected, or was it something else?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
How it's parents? First is parents, after children?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Yeah, you know, like obviously you didn't want to upset your parents about marriage or anything difficult.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
I'm very strong when I come. I'm not afraid for anyone, anything or anyone.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.000
But I'm not strong enough for decision, leave the house or leave the husband or leave the people.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
I have no guts for like this.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And it is, as you said, with the culture, it's like people talk, isn't it?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:04.000
And I always say, now, if I'm honest, with my links, with our links, there is no house who hasn't.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
There are different kinds of issues. The life has completely changed.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And especially, you know, when you were saying about the culture in Pakistan, if a son will get married, it's a different daughter, will have a different life.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:28.000
But here in this country, because people came in like late 50s or 60s, they were still stuck in that culture that the daughter-in-law is like a maid.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
It's not that she's married our husband.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.000
If he's only husband, maybe life is different. When it comes in the family, it's very hard.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And you just find yourself.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Five, six, seven, eight, nine people live in the same house and cooking three times a day.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And very young.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
What does that look like to you now? What is the culture?

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Now? 22 years I live with my in-law.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And after 15 years I live in the rent house. Now it's our house. His house, not ours.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000
I know I had everything.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:19.000
But I have no feelings for thinking or helpless, speechless, everything.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000
I can't say and I can't explain anyone how I feel.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And I want to speak on the culture and traditions as well.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Is there certain efforts you've made in order to preserve?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
We tried to preserve our culture.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
We were from Pakistan. We have established ourselves here.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
That's right. We are behind them.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000
We tried but we couldn't.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Like when she said extended family, loving family.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I can't give my children more time because we live in an extended family.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And what have you been able to do with your children that you're kind of proud of?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Is there certain things that you've done or shared with your children that you're proud of?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:19.000
We have done a lot of things to make our children proud.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
A lot of things but I neglect.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:29.000
I feel I give them more time when they need me.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
I'm always working in the kitchen, cleaning, visiting.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
But they need me.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I say, oh, five minutes, ten minutes and they sleep.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Sometimes I think I can't sleep.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Ten days I can't sleep.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
But there must be something that the children say.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
That you've done a lot for them.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
There's nothing.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
There's no discussion.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
This is the thing actually.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
You have to cut a couple of parts from the recording.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
How would it be?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
When they go into the archive, obviously the story will be there.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
But in general, it will be in a booklet.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Surely it will be 500.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
In the book it will just be a text.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
They're proud because they said, take a lot of things for us.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Don't go back. Don't leave me.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000
If I want to do anything, I get married again and leave this family.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
But I didn't do it for my children.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Nothing.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
The children do appreciate that she did go through a lot because of the children.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
But it's a different time for them.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
They've got their own stresses.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
They do value.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:50.000
But then she's staying with the extended family in marriage just for the sake of first the parents and then the children.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
I think it's more cultural, if I'm honest.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
It has nothing to do with the belief.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Religion doesn't allow a woman to suffer in silence.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
It's just because we are worried about what would my parents think, what would the community say.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
But that's changing.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
When you ask me, what culture, we try to bring it here.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
But our children do tell us, why did you suffer that much?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
They always ask me why.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Why didn't you left?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
My daughter, she's crying.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Like very loud.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Why you take everything and still taking?

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Because they are different.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
They know they have to stand for themselves but not be quiet like us.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
And you said it earlier on how they speak openly from the heart.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:45.000
But then they wouldn't be able to do that if it wasn't for you paving that path and doing exactly what you needed to do so they can't speak.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Because we give sacrifices, the children see that we give.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
So they would say, we are pleading, pleading for our mother's life, what we have to do.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
They are very upset sometimes when they talk to me, very very upset.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:03.000
They come, my youngest son comes every five minutes, mom you okay, you okay.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
But I have no feeling for anyone.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
They are my children but not inside.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
I don't know at the moment.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Is that where Age Alive, something like Age Alive has helped?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Yes, when I go regular now I can't because I have the surgery.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
But I go very, a couple of hours, all days were going very good.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Because I met all friends from different cultures.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:37.000
She's still been on a few groups but it's like help of other people comforting and making sure that people are you know who got health, that they are safe.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
This is something they look after actually us.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
How did you become involved in Age Alive?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
I think because, one of the things was because the group I was running closed.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Yes, we go regularly.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
And Age Alive started picking up actually because they were dying down basically.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
The group was set up by Leanne Taylor from Quinty's first.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
I was involved with her but then she left, somebody else employed and more or less it was.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
That's when you started.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
I go regular in Age Alive.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Not for two, three years, not regular but before that.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
What does it mean to you as well?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Very good, very helpful.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:40.000
My mind is very, like exercise classes and now she's coming for meditation.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
It's very helpful, very good.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:53.000
I finish my, like when I come regular I take off my medicine, like depression.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Very good, yes.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:03.000
And how do you think that supports Asian, black or other minority or majority groups over 50s?

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Very good, very nice.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
I talk to everyone, I don't mind, I talk to everyone.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Why is that important?

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
For peace of mind, yes.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:35.000
I love to go out all the time but now I'm with health problems.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
She wasn't going to come actually so I had to come yesterday.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:48.000
She asked me a lot of times, she said no, no, she said no come, she asked you.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
When he asked I said okay, I didn't say do anything for her.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
And you have to share, it's not all that she's doing, it's just that she wants to do the story.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.000
It is very important if I'm honest actually, you know for Age Alive because people do comfort each other.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:12.000
And when Yasmin comes, despite she is, this is one of her qualities, she doesn't see inside, she may be broken if I'm honest.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000
But she does make cracks, leaving jokes and smile and always she's done that actually.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Sometimes people can't see their qualities, very loving, caring, did her best.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
As a woman sometimes we don't value ourselves, being patient.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000
It's not only about belief obviously, she's religious but she's open minded as well.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Very generous, it doesn't have to be a bad thing.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
She's religious but she's open minded as well.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Very generous, it doesn't have to be, if she will help, it doesn't have to be a Muslim person, she has to help anybody in crisis.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Even if she's not working and she says wherever disaster is she'll pay the money actually.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Because it makes some difference to other people, appreciating what we have but helping others.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:09.000
As a woman sometimes we don't like praise, we feel sometimes embarrassed when other people tell us this is the good quality.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000
And she is when she comes and very helpful, when her health was good.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
And we do miss her when she doesn't come.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:26.000
This is helpful so thank you so much for coming and accepting the invitation to come and share because it's really powerful and really important to hear just your story.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Thank you.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
I think our message will be actually collective.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
You can always add that message actually.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Collective is the one thing that...
