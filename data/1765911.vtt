WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080
So my name is Flavia Humphreys. Today's date is the 21st of April. So you've got Robert Moore and Rob Barnsby.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.580
Yeah.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.580
And are you two friends?

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.080
Yeah.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.580
Yeah.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.080
Lovely.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.080
How long have you two known each other?

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.080
A long time, Rob.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.080
A long time, isn't it, Rob?

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.580
Yeah.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.580
A long time, yeah.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.580
I think.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.580
Yeah.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.580
Brilliant.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:34.660
Can you tell me a little bit about Paris Castle? So where is Paris Castle?

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.660
In Westbourne.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.660
And is it a big castle?

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.660
Yeah. Yeah, it's a big one.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.660
It's a big castle, yeah.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.660
And what does it look like?

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.660
It looks like a king's castle.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.660
Yeah. It's quite big, yeah.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.660
And what sort of things does it have around it?

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.740
You've got a picture going in there.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.740
Ah.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.740
So it's, I don't know.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.740
Yeah, it's a big door.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.740
It's got big doors coming in, isn't it?

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.740
Yeah.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.740
And big doors coming out of it.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.740
Lovely.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.240
Yeah.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.740
And what about the gardens and things? Can you tell us a bit about the gardens?

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.740
Um, we had the help of the gardener, didn't we, Rob?

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.740
Yeah.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.820
Ah, so there's a picture of you two sitting on a bench.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.820
Yeah.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.820
And what were you doing? What's that in your hand?

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.820
What are you holding in your hand?

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.820
A picture.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.820
A spade.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.820
A spade?

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.820
Yeah.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.820
Yeah, a spade helping the people.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.820
You were doing it, but I was doing it somehow.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.820
Yeah.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.820
Lovely. So that was through this project Trust Buddies?

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.820
Yeah.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.820
Yeah.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.900
So what made you want to join Trust Buddies?

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.900
Just thought you'd give it a go?

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.900
Yeah.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.900
Yeah, lovely.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.900
And so when you did your Trust Buddies, how many days a week did you do?

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.900
So we did it on a Friday, didn't we?

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.900
Yes.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.900
Oh, okay.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.900
Yeah, Friday, yeah.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.900
Wonderful. And how did you get to Paris Castle?

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.900
So we had somebody pick us up, didn't we, Rob?

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.900
Yeah.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.980
We went straight home.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.980
Oh.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.980
Yeah.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.980
Yeah.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.980
Wonderful. So you mentioned you did a bit of work in the gardens.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.980
Yeah.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.980
Yeah, lovely. And oh, there you are with your wheelbarrow.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.980
Yeah, that's me.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.980
Oh, fantastic. So what were you doing with the wheelbarrow, Robert?

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.060
So what we had to do was we had to take...

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.060
You were there now, weren't you?

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.060
No.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.060
Because you had to do something else.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.060
So my job was with somebody there, we had to take it to some work, I remember.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.060
So you were helping the gardeners?

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.060
Yeah, to help.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.060
Fantastic.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.060
So they had a greenhouse as well?

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.060
Yeah.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:20.140
The greenhouse down the bottom, so we had to walk a bit far to get to it.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.140
Yeah, so the greenhouse isn't really a place the public would normally see, is it?

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.140
No.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.140
So you probably saw parts of Paris Castle that visitors wouldn't see.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.140
No.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.140
Lovely. So, Rob, where did you have your breaks, your coffee break?

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.140
Where did you go for that?

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.220
I think it's...

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.220
In the big room, honey.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.220
Yeah, big room.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.220
Lovely. So that was inside Paris Castle.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.220
Yeah.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.220
Did they have a kettle?

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.220
Yeah.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.220
Yeah, they had a kettle, yeah.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.220
Wonderful. And then, did you work in the cafe?

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.220
Yes. Oh, yeah.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.220
So what sort of jobs were you doing in the cafe?

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.220
Behind the till.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.220
Really?

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.300
Yeah, yeah. Especially food, yes.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.300
Selling food?

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.300
Oh, yes.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.300
So was that the cafe in the castle or the cafe in the garden?

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.300
Um, I think it was the cafe.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.300
There's two cafes, yeah.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.300
OK. And which of you worked in the ticket booth?

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.300
Me.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.300
Ah, so what sort of things did you do in the ticket booth?

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.300
We had to fop stuff out for people.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.380
So when visitors arrived, did they show you your tickets?

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.380
Show you the tickets?

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.380
Yeah.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.380
And did you have maps that you had to give out or...?

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.380
Yeah, special maps, honey.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.380
So, yeah, special maps, yeah.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.380
Never have.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.380
Yeah.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.380
OK. And did you have many children coming?

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.380
Yeah.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.380
Yeah.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.380
OK. And was there any children's activities?

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.380
No.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.380
Yeah.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.380
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.460
I think there was, but I don't know.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.460
You didn't do that bit?

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.460
No.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.460
OK.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.460
Would you... Were you involved with the Halloween...

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.460
..the pumpkin thing?

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.460
Yeah.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.460
Oh, yeah.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.460
What did you do for that?

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.460
So we had to go...

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.460
You were there, weren't you?

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.460
Yeah.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.460
So we had to go with...

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.460
I can't remember who, so we had to go...

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.460
..down...

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.460
..to Mencap.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.540
Yeah.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.540
Not down to Mencap.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.540
Down to Oshporn.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:49.540
And we weren't very careful and we had to set up different stuff.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.540
So it was a pumpkin thing for the children?

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.540
Yeah.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.540
And then we had to talk to them.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.540
That was hard for me.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.540
Yeah.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.540
Because sometimes I'm shy.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.540
Yes.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.620
So I can't give a word, though.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.620
Did you find, as the time went on at Powys, you felt less shy...

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.620
..the more you went?

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.620
Yeah.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.620
It was getting a little bit easier?

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.620
Yeah, because it was a long time when we went...

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.620
Yeah.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.620
It was a long time because we just had to...

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.620
..stand up all the time.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.620
Yeah, so it's quite tiring.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.620
Yeah.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:30.700
Yeah.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.700
And what about the other people you worked with there?

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.700
So were they obviously the gardeners?

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.700
Yeah.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.700
Anybody else you worked with there?

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.700
The gardeners were quite happy, weren't they, Rob?

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.700
Yeah.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.700
Happy to see me and Rob.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.700
Yeah.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.700
Every Friday we went.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.700
Yeah.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.700
So, yeah.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.780
Yeah, and then we worked with a man...

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.780
..who, um, can't remember who it was, yeah.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.780
Hmm.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.780
So where did you work with him?

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.780
So, um, every Friday when we went, he was...

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.780
..standing by...

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.780
..standing by the top, and then he was waiting for me and Rob

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.780
to come in, wouldn't he, Rob?

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:18.780
Uh, yeah.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.780
Yeah, and then he had to tell us where we...

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:23.860
..go.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:24.860
OK.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:25.860
Yeah.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.860
Like, Rob went with him, and then I was with...

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.860
..somebody else to do, yeah.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.860
Yeah, so you had your own bit of work to do.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:36.860
Yeah.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:37.860
I see.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.860
So in that picture, Rob, you and Robert are in the greenhouse.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.860
Yeah.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:42.860
In the greenhouse.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.860
Ah, so what were you doing in there?

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.860
I was shooting.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.860
You were sweeping up the greenhouse?

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:48.860
Yeah, I'd bend down.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.860
Stuff.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.940
Stuff.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.940
Yeah, I was actually...

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.940
Keeping it tidy?

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:55.940
Yeah, I was like...

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:56.940
Ah, well done.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:00.940
Yeah, doing a finish my own, and putting my scary hood up.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.940
So, um, did you work with any of the other volunteers

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.940
while you were there?

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.940
Um, garners, mainly.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:15.940
Um, so we had to do, uh, sort of, not weird,

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.020
so we had to go on, like, a, um...

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.020
Oh, do you remember we went on a tractor, Rob?

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.020
Oh, yeah.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.020
I sat at the back.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.020
I got stuck, I couldn't get out of the bloody bed.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.020
It was like a tractor.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.020
Yeah.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.020
Trailer thing.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.020
Yeah.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.020
So were you stuck in the tractor or the trailer?

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.020
Trailer.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.020
Yeah, trailer.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.020
Because we had to go up one day with...

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.020
Yeah.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.100
I can't remember who it was.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.100
Yeah, a tractor.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.100
No, somebody else.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.100
Oh, yeah.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.100
So, uh, it was bumpy going up.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.100
Oh, yeah.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.100
Because we had to go...

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.100
Yeah, yeah, you got to put my bladder a bit.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.100
Yeah, and then, um, you wasn't there, were you?

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.100
No.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.100
Um, I got stuck in a van.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.100
I couldn't get out.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.100
Oh.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.100
So how did you get out?

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.100
Because, um, I was stuck in a van.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.180
Because somebody had to...

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.180
Not push me, they just had to...

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.180
Go stuck in a bloody van.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.180
How you get stuck in a bloody van, that?

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:27.180
Because we were taking stuff to the shop.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.180
Yeah.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.180
Oh, goodness.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.180
Bloody van.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:35.180
So what was your favourite things about working there, Rob?

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.180
What did you enjoy the best?

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.180
Um...

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.180
So where was that?

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.180
That was that, so...

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
Yeah, but what were you doing there?

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
Um, showing people.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
So you liked the café and the shop?

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.260
Yes.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
Yeah, and that was your favourite piece?

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.260
Oh, yeah.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
So what particularly did you like about that?

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
A manager, yeah.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.260
You were the manager?

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.260
Yeah.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.260
Well, I do that again.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
Did everybody do what they were told?

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.260
Yes.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.260
Good.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
And what did you have to wear to be the manager?

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.340
Um...

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.340
The hat and the T-shirt, yes.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:19.340
And I had the gold trousers.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.340
So would you say you had to look quite smart?

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.340
Yeah.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.340
Brilliant.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.340
What was your favourite thing, Robert?

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.340
What did you particularly like?

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.340
Smiling at people, eh?

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.340
Yeah, you liked meeting the public.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.340
Yeah, it was good meeting rather.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.420
We were very happy.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.420
Yeah.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:42.420
Nice.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:47.420
Yeah, and did you find that you felt meeting the public got easier?

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.420
Um...

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.420
Some people was hard work.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.420
Yeah.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.420
Because some people do say...

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.420
51.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.420
..where everything is, so...

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.420
Yeah.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.420
Yeah.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.420
That was a bit hard work trying to tell them where everything is,

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.500
so, yeah.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.500
Yeah.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.500
I suppose you might have some regular visitors.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.500
Yeah, from different places.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.500
Did you meet many foreign people or people from other countries?

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.500
Quite... Yeah.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.500
Quite a lot of foreign people, so...

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.500
Hmm.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.500
Yeah, interesting.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:25.500
That was quite weird.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.500
Not weird, though.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.500
Yeah.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.500
Sitting...

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.500
Sorting out and then people come on.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.500
Yeah, so...

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:35.580
Yeah.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:36.580
Lovely.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.580
And is there anything, Rob, that you didn't enjoy?

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.580
I don't know.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:42.580
No?

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.580
No? It was all pretty good?

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:44.580
Yeah.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.580
What about you, Robert?

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.580
No.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:47.580
Was there anything you didn't like?

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:48.580
No, it was good, though.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:49.580
Yeah.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.580
It was good to see different people.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:54.580
Yeah.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:55.580
Lovely.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.580
So would you say you'd do it again if you could?

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:58.580
Yeah.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.580
I would.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:01.580
Yeah.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:02.580
Yeah, lovely.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.660
Have either of you been back to visit the castle?

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:06.660
No.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:07.660
I think I have.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.660
I've come...

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:09.660
...wet.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.660
Yeah, I've been back once.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:12.660
Lovely.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:13.660
Is there anything else you want to add?

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.660
No.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.660
Anything else you think of?

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:16.660
No.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.660
That we haven't talked about?

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.660
No.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.660
No, I'm all empty.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:20.660
No?

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.660
Okay.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.660
Thank you very much.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:23.660
That was really interesting.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:24.660
Yeah.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.660
So I wasn't obviously there and it's nice to hear about it.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.660
So if you think of anything else you want to add,

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.740
you can always fire this up again and you can talk a bit more.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:34.740
Yeah, I'll go and pick...
