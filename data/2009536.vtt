00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.160
The pub was always doing gigs but for a long time it was only local bands and only on a Thursday.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.200
So yeah there was definitely a pre-lip up time when although I think even then that was around

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.680
the like crazy Newport is the New Seattle time so there was big things happening even though it was

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.120
only local bands. We were still getting Guardian reporters turning up and it was a very very strange

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.320
time to be alive. I honestly don't know because I've been asked this question a lot of like loads

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.520
of students want to do documentaries on the TJ's years and things like that and I no matter how

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.480
hard I think about it like none of the bands went on to be absolutely stellar. I mean Catatonia did

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.920
really well but none of them went on to be like your kind of like U2 Ed Sheeran level none of

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.440
them did that. I genuinely don't know it may have just been how many bands there were but then I've

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.760
been involved in scenes in other cities and they have loads of bands as well. I couldn't tell you

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.000
why the world's press decided to descend on Newport for two years it was really weird and even being

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.960
involved in it like we'd get a call you know that the Guardian wants to come and interview you and

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.800
we'd be like why why do they care? I mean even like talking to the 60 foot dolls and things they no

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.040
one knew why it got that big or what on earth you know was the catalyst for that no one could put

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.600
their finger on it. It just happened and it was really strange. I mean we were in TJ's the one

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.080
night and like there's just literally reporters from major newspapers just turning up in TJ's on

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.320
a Friday night to ask people like what's it like living here and you're like I'm pretty sure it's

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.720
the same as living in any other large town in Britain in the 90s it's a bit shit and a bit all

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.440
right it's very very odd. So I know they did um I think it was the NME decided to bring 100 numbers

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.360
in Newport from the phone directory without looking at the names and see how many rock stars

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.040
they could get hold of and they actually managed to get hold of Mike Cole completely randomly by

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.480
choosing a random number and it was like yeah you probably within 100 numbers you probably did have

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.080
a good chance of finding someone that was in a band but they managed to get hold of the biggest

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.360
band from Newport and he absolutely swears that he never gave his parents number out to anyone

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.280
so there's no way they would have like known to do it and things very odd.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.440
There's quite a few La Pop Gigs that stand out. The first couple of years after we moved the stage

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.160
there's some it's a band from Oregon called Larry and his Flask that stands out because they

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.720
Bluegrass Punk uh full brass section double bass standing drummer got stuck in the airport in Prague

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.360
not they flew in from America their driver was driving into Heathrow from Prague he got stuck

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.560
in traffic they ended up sleeping in the airport floor in Heathrow for seven hours and didn't

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.840
actually get to the pub until 10 minutes before stage time and we still managed to get them on

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.600
and the gig to go ahead and it was amazing and it was just that are they coming who knows they're

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.320
not here it's 10 to 10 they're due on and then they all just walked in with their instruments

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.400
and set up and that was a really strange but brilliant really like shows you how innovative

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.000
and amazing people can be when they want something to happen actually only about 20 people turned up

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.440
for that show but they were so good and it was their first time touring the UK so they had a

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.480
lot of dates left on the tour so they came back two weeks later and played again and word of mouth

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.040
had got around and there was 100 people there and it was amazing just within two weeks of word of

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.360
mouth they sold the place out the second time things like um Trash Talk the hardcore band they

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.520
always went down unbelievably well the second we announced one of those shows we knew it we sold

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.520
out in seconds and we knew it would be absolutely amazing and a little bit insane

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.040
that corner stage was dangerous though because Mike Cole from the 60 foot dolls once um knocked

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.680
a girl out with his bass they did a secret show and no one was supposed to know it was happening

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.480
in the way that everyone knows it's happening and I think about 200 people tried to climb into

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.920
upstairs and I missed most of it because I was downstairs on the door trying to like no absolutely

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.640
not we're full and yeah it was so yeah that's like a secret 60 foot dolls gig in lump I think it was

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.680
a warm-up for Redding festival or something literally he's rocking out like this and he

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:22.080
fell forward off the step she got smacked in the face by the bass stock massive black eye on the

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.480
floor unconscious and it was like yeah this is this stage has to go this is not safe think her

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.040
name was Julie but I can't be 100 sure but yeah he knocked her clean out she was on the floor they

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.640
showered her with free t-shirts and we showered her with free drinks like

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:49.200
please don't sue us here's all of the free stuff
