00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Hello, good afternoon Dilwyn. This is Jill Jones from Minera talking to Dilwyn Roberts.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So, hello Dilwyn, thank you very much for deciding to talk to us this afternoon.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now, would you like to start off by saying your name and your date of birth

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and telling us a little bit about your school days, early life?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Yes, I will thank you Jill. I can mention your name, yes?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Yes.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I was born on the 29th of the 3rd 1930. I started school when I was five years old

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
in the Infants Junior School, Pennegallie Road.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I was in the Infants School for over two years until I became seven.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Then I was taken to Pennegallie Junior School which was only ten yards across the road from the Infants School.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I was in the Junior School until the age of eleven.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Then I was transferred to Pennegallie Road Secondary School, Cudpoith.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Yes.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I was there until I was fourteen. Unfortunately, I didn't have any education.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Otherwise, I would have gone to Wrexham Grammar School, but unfortunately I didn't qualify.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Then I had to seek work.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Yes.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Then, in 1944, I had to leave school at fourteen. We all had to.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Yes.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I actually had an education which I did not, like you just mentioned.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Then, a little friend of mine who lived a hundred yards away, he worked in the Monero line works.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
His name was Mr. Moss Edwards and we used to call him Uncle Moss.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Yes.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
He said, is that any work, Dilwyn? I said, no, Uncle.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Looking for work, he said, I'll have a word with my boss.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Then he called to see me one day, Dilwyn. Can you start work on Monday?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I started work in the Monero line works.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:53.000
So, that sounds good and straightforward. So, what sort of work were you doing in the line works, Dilwyn?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Now, in the Monero line works, there were three railway lines.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:11.000
One going up to the number one kiln, one going up to the number two kiln, one going up to the crusher.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Yes, I remember.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Now, on the left, in the bottom, was the manager's office and the manager was called Mr. Sutton, his wife, and he had a young daughter.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Yes.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Next to the manager's office was the clerk's office and there was a general call by the name of Mr. John Roberts and his assistant called Ivor Owen Roberts who lived in Monero.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So, Dilwyn was given a job in the office.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.000
I worked in the office for three weeks and I said to the manager, I'm very sorry, Mr. Sutton, I'm not enjoying this work.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Can you give me another job in the quarry, whatever, ever?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:08.000
No problem, Dilwyn. He said, I'll give you a job in the seater room with a lovely gentleman called little Sam Bellis.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Oh, yes.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And Sam Bellis lived in Gwynedd. I think Sam lived, he was ninety odd.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I think that's right.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
He was not small, and I was, what a lovely gentleman.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And the seat room, it was in the seat room, they called it the seat room.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:38.000
We repaired the seats for when the line was burnt in the number one and number two kilns, the labors had to fill the railway wagons with this burnt line.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Then in case the weather came wet, icy or snowed, we had to cover that line with these sheets, otherwise all the line would dissolve into nothing.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So, I was in the seat room, Wyle was in the seat room, and the seat was next to the clerk's office, all them were linked together.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Yeah.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Then next to the seat room, and I'll give you the history, Mr. Hallam was the foreman, and his cottage was next door to the seat room.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
They were all linked together.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Manager's office, the clerk's office, seat room, and the foreman's, Mr. Hallam.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And he came from, he was a foreman in the quarry in Buxton, in Gavisham.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Yes.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Then, while I was working in the seat room, all the spare time I had, I had to walk to the quarry back, I can't remember the name of the main road to the Menelis, what was it called?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Mice of Funan.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Mice of Funan Road.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I had to walk a quarter mile every day, six times a day, from the quarry to the spring.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Yes.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
In Mice of Funan, to get water for the men, there was no taps there, so that they could have a drink.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Yes.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And that was my job.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And have you seen the Dutch people in Holland?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Yes.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
They had an instrument over their shoulders to carry a bucket on each of them.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Yes.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And I had one of them.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
That was my job for about 18 months.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Then, I was there, I done my apprenticeship in the seat room.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Then, they sent me to the quarry.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I was only a little, five foot nothing, and all the big snappy men, farmers, sons.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Then, I worked on the number one break, on the big drum, with Dye Evans, who was from Gwinnley.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Yes, yes.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And he also had a young son called Stan.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
That's right.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:02.000
But I, unfalterly, you've got to take my memory, I can't hold it in my head, so far, 76 years ago, I can't remember anything.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:10.000
But poor Stan, I think he had anemia, and I think Stan passed away very young, in his life.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Yes, he did.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Yeah, I can recommend that, a lovely young chap, Stan.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Yes.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Then, I was on the break with Dye.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Then, we'd supply three wagons to go down the break, and at the bottom of the break, there'd be a gentleman called Trevor Jones from Gwinnley.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Yes.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
He'd have his big stallion, waiting for the three wagons.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:43.000
The three full wagons would go down the break, and they also would supply us in the quarry with four empty wagons.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Yes.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.000
That was my job, until I became 18 years old.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Then, I was called to the National Service, and the government put Dillwyn in the Royal Air Force.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Oh, that's great.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
For two years.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Yes.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Then, when I finished in the Air Force, when I was 20, I came back to the quarry for two years.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And back, I went with Dye as a breaksman.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Yes.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Dye's assistant.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Then, I had to do alternative jobs.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
I was sent, only once I ever went, to number two kill.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Mm-hmm.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Then, Mr. Hallam finished as a poor man.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Yes.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Then, a lovely gentleman called Mr. Beech.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Yes.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
He became a, and he also came from Buxton.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Then, he said, Dillwyn, I would like you to go to number two kill.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Then, we all had to wear clogs.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Yes.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:01.000
We had to take clogs with us to work, as well as our walking boots, in case we were sent to the kill.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Because, if you went to the kill for one day, you would have no boots to go home in.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Fair enough.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
The heat was that tremendous, it would burn your soles of your shoe.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Yes.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
So, we had to wear clogs, and they were covered in iron underneath.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
All the sole was covered in iron, and the heel.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
So, that they wouldn't burn.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Right.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Then, I only worked there for two days, but I loved it.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
But, every day I went home, I had to jump in the bath.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
My feet was that sore, with the temperature.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
My mam used to put me in the bath, and she used to put some radux in the bath, so that I could get my feet.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Well, I said, oh mam, I don't like this yoke.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Well, don't do it then.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
No, I said, I won't refuse.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Mm-hmm.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Well, luckily, I only done two days there.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Yeah.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Then, do you want any more information about the quarry?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Yes, carry on.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Now, there were, there was, oh, by the way, when I was fourteen and a half, my father was in the war for five years.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
He was in India, fighting the Japanese.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Oh my goodness.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Yes, yes.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:25.000
When he come home, till when he said, I'm going to have six weeks off, spend all my immigration money from the army, the Royal Tilly.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Mm-hmm.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And, we used to go to cinema in Kapoor, Parrish Hall in Kapoor, my mam would take us there.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And, I was the oldest.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
I was nine.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Mm-hmm.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
I had a brother and a sister.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And, and we saw these ships going on all the pathing hills.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Dill, your dad might be on that boat.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
We don't know where he's going, but he might be on it.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And, he finished off Columbus Ceylon.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Mm-hmm.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Then, he come home.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
He said, can you get me a job, Dill, in the limelight?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Yes, dad, I said.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Alas, Mr. Beats.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
So, I went.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Mr. Beats, he was in the time clock, Mr. Beats, always watch everybody come in.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Yes.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
So, if you give us our job for the day.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Yes.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000
We signed on with the clock.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Mm-hmm.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Dill went, do this, do that, and he had to go.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Like, I loved every job there besides the number two kill.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
I didn't like that job.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Mm-hmm.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Two out.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
I mean, I didn't like heat.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
I said, oh, Mr. Beats, can I sit?

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Yes, he said, take him with them while everybody's coming in first.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
He went and leveled it here.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Come in the office, so everybody knows.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
My father told him, oh, lovely Dill.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And, he said, oh, Mr. Beats, oh, he's okay.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
He gets a little bit malaria, I said, but he's okay.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
He gets treatment for it.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
We've been in India.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Still, I'm sorry, Mr. Dill, when he said it.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And my dad's standing there.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
I got my dad a job there.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Yes.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
So, and my dad is there.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
That's good news.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Still, them, and I come from the Air Force.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Mm-hmm.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Now, there was ten smallish wagons on the Cloddy face.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Mm-hmm.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And there was two men, partners to each other.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Mm-hmm.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
But I can name them all, but it's either going to be at last Christmas.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:20.000
But my father was partnered with a lovely chap, Uncle Injavis, from Middle Road, Matt.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Uncle Injavis.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And his son's grandson is still alive now, but not as personally like my father.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And there was ten pairs of them, yeah.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And that's the job I was given, too.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Supplying these ten men with a wagon to fill them with limestone.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And a couple of times, I went on the little wading machine on the Cloddy.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Yes.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
And they had a little engine there.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And Alf Wild was responsible for keeping that engine in good form.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Also the big engine, Bob the Engine.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Yes.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Bob, and I think Bob was one good in it.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Mm-hmm.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000
I think so, Bob.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And Bob, my big best friend, also Daniel's, from Nants Square, Matt, good boy.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
He was the skunter on the train.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Yes.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
For the number one kill and number two kill.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And poor Daniel, he lost his sight when he was 34 years old.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Oh my goodness.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Yeah, TB.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Yes.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Best friend of mine, Daniel.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
And so it's that group of people.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Then the oldest fella next to me would be Albert Peters.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Yes, I remember Albert.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
From Buchwind or Gwinnett.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Yes.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Is he still alive?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
I don't think so.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Was his wife called Cain when?

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
I don't know.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
You don't know?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
That's all I know.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
He was in the same class as me in school, the second in school, the good boy.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Yes.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And he, Ned a go, he was from Middle Road, Nants.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Yes.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
He was the blacksmith.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Ned a go, Ned a go, his name was, go is a blacksmith.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Yes.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And Albert was his apprenticeship, apprentice.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Yes.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And Ned a go was in charge if he had a runaway on the break.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Yes.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Then, let's get down now, then a job I had was with Trevor and Joss.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Yes.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
With the two stallions.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Yes.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Trevor wasn't well, Joss wasn't well.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Billman, can you do the horses?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Yeah, I'll have a go Mr. Beech.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I done okay.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Then I used to, Trevor used to, like he was Trevor, he used to supply number one kill

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
with a limestone.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Yes.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Three wagons at a time.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Yes.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Then the next three wagons, he'd take them over to number two break, to the small break

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and the small drum, supplying number one kill.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
And Joss would be in charge of that drum and the wagons and the horse.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Yes.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Joss.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Then on a Saturday morning, Trevor said to me, we'd like extra work on Saturday morning,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
same about every six weeks.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Yes, Trevor, a bit extra work for you lad, thank you.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
We had to fill a big railway wagon with horse manure.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Right.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
And he said, where's the manure going, Trevor?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:42.000
He said, just outside, I think it is in Mach Wheel somewhere, a big mushroom farm to make

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
mushrooms.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Yes, yes, that sounds right.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Horse manure heats up quickly.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Yes.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And you've got to have heat for mushrooms.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Then when we had the horses, on a Monday morning, believe me, we, Trevor, we'd go down, Joss

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:09.000
sometimes, past the Mr. Beattie's house, Sheet Room, Clark and Mr. Sutton's.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
On the left was a big steep bank with all the wretches, the dust, lime dust.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Yes.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
And I used to work, oh, I didn't like that job by then.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
No, it didn't this job.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Anyway, I did it.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Then, lower down, 100 yards down the road, there was two fields and the horses were grazed

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000
there.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Ah, right, I know.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
And you, do you know what, do you know what, Jill?

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
We had to cook some, they were wild.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Mm-hmm.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Being let free, you see.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Yes.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
We had to cook some with hay and horse nests.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Mm-hmm.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Well, what a job.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
But they got used to us and we need being new, now and again.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
They weren't used to me, you see.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Horses, like, seen as birds, they go for colour.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Mm-hmm.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
And if you didn't like your jacket or something, you'd have a job to train them.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Mm-hmm.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Yeah.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
I found that out to Trevor's telling me all about it.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
He said to me one day, have they got a different colour pullover, Jill?

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
And I said, yeah, why?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
This horse doesn't like it pullover.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000
No?

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
And same as my birds, I keep birds.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
They don't like colour.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
No.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Anyway, so that was that part of it.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Then across, right opposite the office and all that, that block, there was a big wane

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:40.000
room where Bob the Engine, he'd bring all the wagons down with a lineman.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
He'd have them all weighed.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Then the big railway wagon from, the big train from Wrexham, number one train, come

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:54.000
and pick them up and take them to Brombeau Steel to make steel with it, with a line.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Yes.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Yeah.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Then they'd also take limestone as well.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Then in Brombeau they had a big crusher and they crushed it into dust for the farmers

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
to put on the farms.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Right.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
And Mr. Beats said to me one day, he said, you're going to have a walk in the morning.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
We gave you an accent for it.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Why, Mr. Beats?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
You'll have to walk to Brombeau for a couple of weeks every morning.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Why, I said, you're going on the crusher and to load the bags with dust, he said, for the

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
farmers.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
I was there for two or three weeks.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
I didn't like the job but I did it.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Very, very dusty.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
I had to wear a mask and glasses, you know.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Yes.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
So I did that job.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Yes, I would hope so.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Yes.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
And anyway, I'm going back to number one kiln.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
I loved landscape.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
I was a landscaper for five years.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Mm-hmm.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
From when I was 34 years old to when I was 39.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
And that's how we became landscaper.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
And I'd walk, we only had half an hour for dinner.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:10.000
I'd have a sandwich in the inn and there was lovely woodlands in the Minerva line, Maxine.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Yes.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
I don't know whether the habitat had been taken away or not, I don't know.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
No, that's all still there.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
The number one kiln, right at the end of the number one kiln, where the line completed.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Yes.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
You couldn't go any further.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000
The line completed.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Then there was a break supplying the wagons to come down.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Yes.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
But that railway line finished there.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
That's the end of it.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
The big buffers stopped the wagons going any further.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Then on the left there, there was a lovely woodland.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Shrubs away, not big, big trees.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
I used to suddenly get through them.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
I knew top of all these flowers, Jill.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Yes.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
All types.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
What's the main one, did you say, you get?

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
The one they all are interested in is the orchids.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Now, I used to see them orchids.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Yes.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Then, in them days.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Yes.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000
76.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
I used to love it.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
And I used to take some home.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Yes.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
For me mother.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
That's it.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Yes.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
The smell on them.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Oh, that's it.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
And primroses.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Yes.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000
All sorts.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Yes.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Wild flower vegetation.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
So, hopefully that vegetation is still there.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
It is.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Yeah.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
It is, because they're part of my list.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
That's it.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Because I check.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
That's it.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:39.000
And I, oh, and then there was a Percy Ellis working on the big whey machine.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Percy.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Yes.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.000
When he was working in the Sheets Room, and he married me auntie's sister from New Brighton.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Mm-hmm.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Percy did.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
So, what?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
He had married her then.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
He did.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
I found out he'd married.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
My auntie Phyllis' sister from New Brighton.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
And I used to call her when he had a bit of dinner in the Sheets Room.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Mm-hmm.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
I'd go there and I'd chat to Percy.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Yeah.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
We'd have a chat, yeah.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
And Sam Bellis used to love me when I started working there.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
I'd get a pencil and a paper.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Not bad.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
I'd take it with me.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
I used to love drawing.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Right.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Yes.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
What you doing, Dill, when you said, I'm drawing, Sam.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
What you drawing?

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
I said Donald Duck.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Never.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Sam was looking.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
D'oh, Dillwyn, that's lovely.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Do you know what he said?

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000
My son, I don't know what he said, but Jean-Ruth, I'm not sure his son's name, he used to work

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
on the face of firemen on the face of the quarry, blowing the quarry up with dynamites.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Yes.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
And he lived in Gwinnivu.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
I don't know if he was married or not.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Very, very tall.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Sam was little.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000
His son was very, very tall.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
He was a very, very tall man.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
He was a very, very tall man.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
He was a very, very tall man.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
He was a very, very tall man.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
He was a very, very tall man.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
He was a very, very tall man.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:22:03.000
I used to be a copy drawer.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
I could never draw a human being.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Never.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
But his son, he was absolutely marvelous.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Absolutely marvelous, he was.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
And he took mine home to show his son.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Yeah.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:29.000
And I used to, going away from the limax now really, I used to join Chums League in their

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
ex-sum leader.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Yes.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
There only used to be one ex-sum leader then.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
There was three every Thursday.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Yes.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
There were three.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
A big, big, massive paper.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Not like the paper you get now.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Massive.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
You'd have three every Thursday.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
And I joined the Chums League.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
I went every week nearly.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
And I'd go to Montgomery.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Cone Montgomery and South Africa, where he beat Rommel and his men.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
General Montgomery.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
You've heard of General Montgomery during the war.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Yes, I know General Montgomery.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000
And an elephant.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Yes?

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
And a lion's face on his head.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:14.200
his face and his head, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck all them. My mother had a letter, I'd

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:18.680
been working in the Linux then, and she said, I do, and he said, I've had a letter from

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:24.920
the editor, the editor of Leading. I said, yeah. He said, we're going there Saturday

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:29.880
morning, it's in Queen Street, anything, remember? I'll go on the road, I can't remember

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:38.280
where, because my memory's not as good. Look what he says, I read it, he says, please do

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:47.640
not trace your drawings. Right, my mother said, to the temper, I'm going to get a notepad

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:52.600
and a pen, a pencil, my mother, I want one, a pen. Went down there, she knocked on the

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:58.360
door, could I speak to the editor, please? We went upstairs, yes, introduced ourselves,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000
right, what's this letter you sent me? But my son says, my son's never traced his life,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.640
well, yes, Mr. Roberts, he couldn't draw that good. Right, he said, my son was brought a

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:18.040
photo of Donald Duck here, he's going to draw it for you, and I drew it for him. Mr. Roberts,

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:27.240
he said, apology, and following week, following Thursday, it was in the, what do you call it,

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:38.600
and I got an award for it, I had a book for it, an apology, and you know what they call it,

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:50.920
then a couple of weeks after, my photo of a lion was there, right, and what do you call it,

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:58.360
a girl's name underneath, I drawn it. Down, my mother went to me again,

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:05.400
yeah, oh, Mrs. Roberts, we are sorry, it's not my fault, he said, it's these people who work for us,

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:11.960
and an apology was made, and an erection needed, and ma'am, I'm not going to bother John again,

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.400
and send that episode any, that was linked to the alignment, because I used to draw for Sam

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:27.960
Billis, yes, yes, and I don't know where else he want me to go now, well, shall we stop for a minute,

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:41.640
and yes, now, can I ask you a question now, yes, I hope I am going to, you tell me if I'm making any

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:48.840
errors, or I don't need that said, please tell me, I do go on, but I got information in my head,

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:55.400
and it's coming out, yes, can I just stop you for a minute, if you want to stop me Carol,

00:25:55.400 --> 00:26:03.480
or Jill, stop me, I don't know, I'm concerned, I've got this back now, when I pressed it,

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:08.840
there was a light saying it was recording, and I think it's still recording now,

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:16.600
but I'm worried in case it hasn't captured, oh yeah, everything, everything, so I'm going,

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:22.360
I think the best thing to do is to try and check, yes, because,

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:30.760
what it did, it lights up, and it says it's recording, and then it displays some numbers

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:37.880
to say it's recording, and then it goes off, the writing goes off, so you're not quite sure

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:44.760
whether it's still capturing, or whether it's gone off, but if it's recording me talking now,

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:50.120
we should be okay, because it's, it will have recorded you too, so what I'm going to do now,

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:57.560
is I'm going to see if we can go back, so it says to play back, yes, so do I,

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:05.800
because a lot of the men you mentioned, I knew, I knew them as savers, when I first moved into,

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:15.960
any names you want to know? Not, now one thing's possible, Sam yeah, um,

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:25.800
Dye Evans, Dye, and Stan Evans I knew, yeah, did he pass away at the young stand? He did,

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:35.720
I remember my, my husband being, he died in his mid-30s, yeah, that's it, now he had another

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.720
older brother,
