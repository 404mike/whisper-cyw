00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.440
An Annuil day was meant to be the day that you celebrated your local saint, but in Llanthuys

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:24.280
case it was on the 3rd of May and not in November when the date of Sindhildids day is.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:32.400
It's supposed to commemorate the defeat of John O'Neill, an Irish pirate who invaded

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.280
the area and was repelled by the local people.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:47.800
The events took place down in the Colhew meadows behind the beach.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:01:00.480
A band led by a local dignitary would make their way down to the beach to be met by

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.720
someone playing the pirates.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.880
And a battle would then take place.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.720
It was an opportunity to crack the heads of your enemies and then make up with them afterwards,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.800
because everyone then on the defeat of John O'Neill would then march back up to the town

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.160
and drink and eat to their hearts content.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:34.420
This used to take place until the time of the odd fellows, a friendly society who changed

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:43.640
things in the mid-1850s from a revel to a more sedate march round the town, a church

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:51.400
service and lunch in the town hall, accompanied of course by copious amounts of ale.
