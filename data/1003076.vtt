00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I think now we'll hear from Bill Williams about Black Diamond, as he remembers it.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The Welsh people of Black Diamond, some of the Welsh came from Nortonville in California,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
where they had worked for the coal company, and then the coal company moved to Black Diamond, they continued working for them.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Some people came directly from Wales, some were from other parts of the country.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It is a natural thing for men who are familiar with coal mines to return to work in a coal mine.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It's often said that once a miner, always a miner. I'll disapprove of that later in my talk.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The Welsh people were organizers of churches, lodges, labor unions, teams of baseball and football, and mine rescue teams.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
They competed with teams of other mining towns.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The three churches prospered, and when one church had a social or bizarre, people from the other churches would attend.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
They supported each other. Black Diamond was a happy town. The citizens were not all Welsh.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
There were many people from other European countries, but they intermixed both in joy and sorrow.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
There were accidents in the mine, and all citizens felt the loss.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I have spoken of Welsh being leaders who stood for the causes they believed were right.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I am thankful, and I know others are thankful, that the miners persisted at the start of the big union strike, which was in regard to wages.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:02:03.000
The coal company brought in strikebreakers and guards to protect them, and they operated the mine while the union and the company worked out a plan to buy the miners' homes because they were built on company property.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:17.000
This alone will demonstrate that there was no violence, even though some of their neighbors went back to work as strikebreakers.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I wonder if this condition could prevail today without violence. Things have changed.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The union and the miners built a new town about a mile west of Black Diamond and called it Morganville.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Now we are talking about the newcomers and the union miners on strike.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:46.000
The miners had settled in their new houses, but the post office was in Black Diamond, so the former residents had to go back to Black Diamond to get their mail.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
This was always a reminder of where they used to live, but they endured it.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I mentioned to a man who lived there about the absence of violence, and he told me how near they came to violence.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:12.000
The newcomers at Black Diamond decided that they were going to go down to Morganville and beat up on the union miners.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:24.000
But one person up there who was sympathetic to the union miners went down and told the men what was planned.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So they got their hunting rifles and went out on the edge of town and got underneath a house and were ready if anything should happen.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And one Welshman walked out to meet them. He said, boys, I'd like to talk to you.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:50.000
He said, I'd advise you not to start any trouble because, he said, see this house underneath there? See those guns sticking out?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000
He said, I think you'd better go back where you came from. And they turned around and went back to Black Diamond.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I have mentioned people who have been very prominent in Welsh activities.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:15.000
But as I have not mentioned names of anything, there is one person that I would like to speak of, was Miss Jenny Edwards.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.000
At the celebration of March 1982 at Westminster Presbyterian Church, she gave a talk.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And as far as I could tell, it was all from memory. She didn't seem to refer to notes at all.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And she gave a wonderful description of the early mining days.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:48.000
So eventually these miners who had moved out to Morganville went and found jobs at other places away from the mines.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And they built, well, some of them moved to Seattle, some of them to Renton and other little towns.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And they either built new homes or lived in homes that were much better than the homes that they had lived in Black Diamond.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And I must say, in their new homes they even had indoor toilets.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:28.000
They proved that a coal miner's life was not for life. They could work successfully at other occupations.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Now I've told you about the Welsh miners. You might wonder what eventually became of the Pacific Coast Coal Company.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:45.000
They sold their seam ship line, the town of Black Diamond, 6,000 acres of land, and a new cement plant which they had in Seattle.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And the company went out of business.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:06:00.000
All of that I've told you is in the new book that has just been published called Black Diamond Mining Memories.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.000
It can be purchased at Black Diamond at the Black Diamond Museum.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:17.000
You will find most everything there in the book except there's one thing I'd like to mention that you won't find.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:25.000
My company wanted the bosses to work the miners hard.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And there were many who either got fired or left because they wouldn't mistreat the men working for them.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:43.000
And one of those men was my dad. I wondered why dad wasn't a foreman. He was at one time.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And he pulled a one-man strike. He just didn't go to work.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:58.000
The mine superintendent who knew him well because he lived just a block away went to dad and asked him what was wrong.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
He says, well, I'll tell you. He says, I won't work those men the way they want me to.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
He says, they're working hard under very dangerous conditions.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
He says, well, all right. He says, I'll find you another job. So he did.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.000
He found him a job as an operator of the water pumps to pump the water out of the mine.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So I don't want you feeling sorry for the poor coal company.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:37.000
As the saying goes, so you shall reap. They lost everything. Thank you.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Thank you.
