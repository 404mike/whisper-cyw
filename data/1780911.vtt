WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920
Things have been said to me. I'm just going to say I'm with Martin Morgan at

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:16.440
Black Rock Fishery near Chepstone. I'm okay to say near Chepstone. Yeah. Monday

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:24.960
January the 21st I think. I think. Right. Okay. Yeah this fishery was...

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.640
I'm going to sit a bit closer. There were three fisheries on the 7 Estuary of the Esk District.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.680
The 7 District and the Wye District. So it was basically that the Estuary, there was lines drawn

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.320
of the Estuary and you'd have the 7, the Esk and the Wye Districts. People often

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.720
you know sort of misled into thinking we were fishing on the Wye because people

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.480
would be told they fish on the Wye but they would actually say in the Wye

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.360
District. The Black Rock Lave Net Fishery is the last fishery remaining on

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:06.160
what was fished in the Wye District. There were stop boats, tuck nets,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.640
sane nets. Lave nets actually on the Wye but we fish in the Estuary and it's a

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.880
defined area called Gruggy Rocks and that's the last of the Wye District.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.360
Fishermen from the past there was a guy called Ron, Ron Williams and I actually

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.440
had his license. When Ron dropped the license he wasn't actually dead. He was one of the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:38.640
few that sort of gave up a license without dying. But Ron was a character, he was an ex-Royal Marine and one of the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.960
stories he told me years ago was that when he was a boy growing up in the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.880
village he came home on a weekend on a Sunday with a salmon under his arm. He

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.840
found in one of the pools, brought it home to the house and his father gave

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.920
him a good hammering and he said why do you do that? He said he wasn't for bringing the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.760
fish home at all, he was for bringing it home on a Sunday.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:20.760
He did sabbath. So he was a sabbath and he gave him a hammering but a clip-row mirror and it was purely because he did it on a Sunday.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:30.760
Mentioned it on Sundays, Doug Brown another old fisherman, picture of him on the wall there through his years.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.520
Dougie was a keen fisherman, sort of started off when he was a young boy, sort of

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.680
coming down with the older fishermen, sort of looking after the boat and it was a habit of

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.520
them to go across the estuary from Black Rock to the English side, there's a hotel,

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:56.520
what they call the New Passage Hotel and they would go over there for a pint on a Sunday and any other day they could as well I think.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:05.520
But especially on a Sunday because Wales was dry and pubs weren't open on a Sunday and Dougie used to say

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:15.520
they would go across on a boat, row across on the path of the New Passage and Doug would be left at the pill there on the other side to look after the boat

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.520
once they went in through the booze up and then come back.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:32.520
And they would also, with the boat they would go upstream as well and there's a per-but, I can't remember the name of it but there's a per-what's it called?

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:42.520
Anyway, it wasn't unusual for them to travel around the estuary for their fun and having a drink and meeting other fishermen.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.520
It was a different time.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.520
Ron, well Ron will get up to another story.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.520
Bob Leonard and Pete Leonard were fishermen in my day.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.520
Their father Grant Lee also fished.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:17.520
Grant Lee was a bit of a character. Bob used to say he liked a beer, he liked a butcher, a coalman, sort of everything really, jack of all trades but also a fisherman.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:25.520
When Grant Lee died, on the day he died, there used to be a path from Blackrock through to Port Scud and Subrock.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.520
You could get a car along before the cliff all fell in.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.520
They were taking Grant Lee's coffin along the cliff path there.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:46.520
I always think of it as Grant Lee's last fish because as they were going across up the path they looked over to what we call the salmon pools and there was a fish kicking up in the pool.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:05:00.520
Bob said he looked at Pete, Pete looked at Bob and Pete had run back to the house, got his waders and his net and went down and picked the fish up on the day Grant Lee's been gone.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.520
That's fantastic.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.520
Oh, what a good story.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.520
I told you the one about Bob and the...

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.520
Prince Philip?

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.520
Prince Philip, yeah, I told you that.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:20.520
Bob was back in the 50s when my great grandfather caught the monster fish.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.520
I told you that story.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.520
He actually said that the following day he went down there and he seen an even bigger fish.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:40.520
He said he stood there in the same place, in the hole, just off Subrock, and a fish came through at about half tide and he said the water, as the fish was coming through the shallows,

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.520
was going as high as the top of a Land Rover, sort of, with the power of the fish going through and he reckons that was bigger.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.520
Sounds like a shark.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.520
Yeah, that big old fish.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.520
Have you ever found any unusual fish out there?

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:09.520
Yeah, the most unusual fish I ever caught out there was a common carp in the 7S tree, which is, you know, only the year of it I'd seen one once and it was on.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:19.520
On an occasion that my brother and I had been fishing down the hole, again, down off Subrock, and we caught a salmon.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:32.520
We had a salmon with us and we were coming back, part of the boat up in the bay at Black Rock, and we were walking past what we called the pool, and there was a fish moving in the pool.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.520
I can see the mark of it, sort of a bit of a ripple on the surface.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:48.520
So we opened the net out and jumped in, scooped the fish up, and to my great surprise, at the bottom of the net was a carp about four and a half, five pound.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:07:00.520
And it's not something you would usually get in the 7S tree, but at that time we were having torrential rain, constant torrential rain, and when we were actually fishing in the S tree,

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:11.520
you'd be stood mid-channel and looking back upstream to the old bridge and it would just be like a forest with the amount of wood washed out of the rivers.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:18.520
There was so much wood being washed out, so much fresh water coming into the S tree.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:26.520
I mean, there was just hundreds and hundreds of trees and branches and, you name it, it was in the beer garden tables.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:32.520
So what had happened there was a fish somewhere along the line had been washed out of a river.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.520
I think it's someone's pond.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.520
It's a bit of the most unusual fish I've ever seen out there.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.520
We've seen porpoise out there, you know, whilst we've been going fishing.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:51.520
Seals, seals have come through one day. I wasn't actually fishing, but there were three or four of them stood in what we call the gut.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:59.520
There was a massive seal that went through there, sort of, we don't know how much water it got through there, I don't know, but it went between the fishermen.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.520
Then it was as big as the fishermen as well, it was huge.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.520
Oh, wow. Yeah.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:09.520
But we often see a seal out there during the season.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:20.520
I noticed there was somebody put something up on one of your Facebook posts and it was a woman talking about nets at Camp Road or something.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.520
She, I can't remember the name of the woman.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:35.520
Yeah, she bought my great-grandfather's, my grandparents' house, 13 Camp Road, which I say back in the day was called HQ.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:41.520
And there had always been laid nets at the back, sort of left there.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.520
And when they bought the house, there must have been a couple of old nets left there.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:52.520
But yeah, the back kitchen was where they brought the fish and put them in a tin bath.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.520
That's enough back in the day.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:06.520
But the back of that garden comes out onto the sub rock camp and then it was a short walk down for them down onto the cliff, down onto what we call the Winkle Beds.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:16.520
The Winkle Beds, which is a little reef just basically right in front of the house sort of thing in the estuary.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.520
So you were going Winkle Picking then?

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.520
Winkle Bed, no.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.520
There were Winkles there, not in any great quantities when I was a kid.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.520
I mean, you did see the shells and you could, if you wanted to, guess, but I've never done it.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.520
But somebody at some point in time must have collected Winkles down there.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:41.520
The pollution situation down there was so bad, I can't imagine in the 60s and 70s anybody would want to eat a Winkle.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.520
Is that because the ship building nearby?

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.520
No, it was the paper mill discharge point was not too far from there.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.520
And that area was heavily polluted, very heavily polluted.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.520
And you had Britannia Sink in the estuary opposite.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:04.520
I read a book recently, a MacGreen piecebook, and it recommended that basically you don't eat the fish.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.520
Or if you did, you don't eat very much of it.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:14.520
You know, sort of the, you know, the cellulose flounders, things that live in the estuary, shellfish, daffodil would be a big no-no.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:24.520
I was speaking to somebody last week and his great-grandfather used to climb the cliffs that overlook the Wye towards Chepstone.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:28.520
Towards Chepstone for seagulls eggs. Did anyone ever do that?

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:33.520
Yeah, that was my great-grandfather William Corbyn.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:44.520
Their family is from Chepstone and he got his nickname Nester from his habit of climbing the cliffs in Chepstone collecting seagulls eggs.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:52.520
And he used to do that and also used to dive or jump off the old rowey bridge, crossing the Wye as well.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:11:04.520
He also with Nester, William Corbyn, my great-grandfather, there's a rock named after him out in what we call the hole.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:17.520
And Nester's rock is the name of the rock and all it is really is a small rock about three foot by three foot, 18 inches high.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:30.520
And he was quite short, he was perhaps, I don't know exactly, five foot four, five foot five, a worry little fella.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:39.520
And he would always be last out of the boat and he would always stand on that rock because it just allowed him to get out of the boat a little bit earlier.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:45.520
When you start fishing the water is sort of up to the top of your chest where you just put it.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.520
Nester's rock and that rock is named after him.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:54.520
Do you know anything about the fisheries that are downstream like Goldcliff?

00:11:54.520 --> 00:12:05.520
No, I don't know a huge amount about them really. They were mainly basket fisheries.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.520
And by that do you mean like putcher?

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:15.520
Putchers, yeah, conical baskets originally made from willow and hazel.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:23.520
There will be hundreds of baskets in some ranks set to a scaffold usually facing the ebb tide.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:30.520
They aren't set on a slight incline and the salmon swim in, they've got no reverse gear, they can't get back out.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.520
The tide goes out and the fisherman comes along and collects the catch.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:47.520
The ones in sort of recent times, not recent times, in memory then, the Undy putcher rank, the Porton putcher rank and the Goldcliff putcher rank.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.520
There's three main ones.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:13:01.520
And they know that the Undy rank was, what happened there was that the number of baskets was reduced down to 150 baskets,

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:11.520
perhaps in the 60s by the Natural Rivers Authority and it became uneconomic to use.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:26.520
Porton, I'm not sure when that closed, but Goldcliff closed in 1995, bought out by Anglin Interests and the Environment Agency, but closed down, all never to return.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:33.520
The other basket fishery was not salmon fishery, it was putts or kipes.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:46.520
They were medieval baskets fished in groups of perhaps six, seven, eight and they were used to catch white fish made from hazeln and willow as well in three sections.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:57.520
I can't remember the four wheel, I can't remember the names of them, but a kite or putt was used to catch white fish and shrimp.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:10.520
Same thing applies with face the ebb tide, the fish pushed in by the tide and then the fish will come along at low tide when they're dry and take the end basket off and take the catcher.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:24.520
We found baskets buried in the clay that are kipes and putts or these things at hundreds if not a thousand years old on the estuary.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:29.520
Just amazing. Did you ever lay eel traps on the reams?

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:44.520
No, no, no. We've never trapped fish in the reams, but as a kid we would catch stiltbacks and eels and newts and the like in the reams. They seemed to be a lot cleaner back then.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:49.520
But I've never seen locally anybody trap fish like that.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:15:05.520
We used to fish, as kids we'd go fishing in the in the in the pills we used to call them sort of San Pierre pill was a good one, sort of very natural sort of pill.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:15.520
Not been evened out, scraped out, it was just like a meandering sort of brook really, but still a pill.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:21.520
And we'd fish with a rod and line for you get flounders and little eels and things up in those.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:35.520
The only other fishing we really done sort of, you know, obviously rod and line fishing, but we'd also go congering years ago, sort of out on the bedwinds at low tide.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:48.520
And that involved walking out to rocky areas in the estuary with a bar, iron bar and poking it under a rock, rattling the rock about and then hopefully there'd be an eel under there.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:52.520
And he'd come out and you'd take it and kill it at the table.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.520
Into an egg?

00:15:53.520 --> 00:16:02.520
No, just that it would wriggle out onto the stones, onto the shingle or whatever and you'd just dump him on the head and take him out.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.520
You'd have to be quick wouldn't you?

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.520
Once they're out there they've got nowhere to go.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.520
Right, they're really quick.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.520
Is a conger eel different to an eel?

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.520
Just bigger generally.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.520
You wouldn't get those up in the reams then?

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:29.520
No, no, no, not in a ream. You'd have a green eel, what you'd call a green eel, and silver reels, hidden reams and alvers, live in reams.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:34.520
But do you know that reams, they're very unique to this area, aren't they really?

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:40.520
So is it something as a kid, young children did, they just played in around the reams?

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.520
Yeah I think they would.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.520
Were there many reams? Do they have different names?

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:49.520
No, I can't think of any names from reams at all. It would just be pills.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:56.520
I mean, all the reams run out of the pills then into the estuary.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:06.520
As far as the Black Rock, Lavenette fishing grounds go in the surrounding areas, I mean you've got San Pierre pill, and reams would run into that.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:16.520
The pill is the outlet to the estuary, isn't it? But the reams run into the pill.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:21.520
And then you've got what we call little pill, again, reams run into that.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.520
And then you've got Calicot pill.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:35.520
And then you might have got, after that, no sorry, going back that way again towards Chepstow you've got Mathen pill.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:44.520
So west of the sub-rook you've got Calicot pill, Collister pill, and then Magor pill.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:50.520
Might be a couple more further west again. But basically all the reams run into those, and that's the end left of the estuary.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:18:04.520
It's quite interesting, Calicot pill, when the, what was it, the Troggy River, Troggy, T-R-O-W-G-Y, was diverted.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:10.520
Don't ask me when. Then it was diverted into Calicot pill.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:23.520
And Calicot pill runs out across the foreshore, through the seawall, and then out across the mud to the black bed winds.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:33.520
And then empties a mile offshore into a fishing place we call the Luby, which is a pretty popular,

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.520
it used to be a popular, a pretty popular fishing place.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:44.520
Out there you've got various gullies that used to be used for fishing, for whitefish.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:52.520
One is called the cannibal gut. And cannibal gut, gut is a name we use for a channel basically.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.520
Is that G-U-T-T? Yeah, G-U-T, just gut.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.520
And that's the channel used for, we fish in.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:08.520
And that cannibal gut, we call that the cannibal gut because it's about the only area on the estuary we find cannibals, obviously.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.520
So hence the cannibal gut. You find cannibals? Yeah, lots of cannibals out there.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:18.520
Really? When we were kids we tried to carry them back and sort of get halfway back and just dump them.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:25.520
But yeah, there's two sizes, one's just behind you there, there's two behind me.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:32.520
Oh my god. We're not sure if a ship sunk or if it was, we just don't know.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:40.520
There's one specific area covering five or six hundred meters, sort of where there's cannibals.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:44.520
That's amazing. Do you ever find the remains of old boats or anything like that?

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:52.520
Yeah, there's one, the John, that was run aground on gruggy rocks in, I think it was 1942.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:58.520
She was, I think carrying coal, wrecked on the rocks.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:06.520
And she's well broken up now, but you can still identify the riveted construction, the portals, the chain.

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:16.520
Oh gosh. We found a wooden boat or parts of a wooden boat in the sands, on the Bedwind Sands.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.520
It was out there recently actually and she's covered up again.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.520
You put that on Facebook, didn't you? Yeah.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:29.520
You can just see the keel. No, no, no, that was a rib, we found that was just a rib.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:36.520
It is on Facebook somewhere, but that was just a rib we found.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:40.520
I was walking out there and I found a rib of a boat.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:53.520
But also in another spot, there's a wooden boat, plenty of iron on it, sort of the brackets that's what we first spotted.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:59.520
Went back out there and then more of the boat had been exposed, but a few weeks ago she'd been covered up again.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.520
So things on the sands, it's constantly changing.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.520
It's a shifting sand type there, isn't it? Yeah, it changes every day.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.520
It depends which way the wind is blowing.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:13.520
And part of the fishing is keeping an eye on things every season.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:20.520
We like going out there, not all of us, but there's three or four of us that spend quite a bit of time out there.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:25.520
We look after it, make sure there's no netting and all the rest of it.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.520
But of interest is things you find.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:35.520
Clay pipes, Roman pottery, all sorts of things.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.520
And it's just people are going out there forever.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:44.520
A couple of weeks ago, it was quite funny really.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:52.520
I was out there and I found a pelvic, like a bonesy pelvis sort of thing.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.520
You're joking.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.520
I found a few things and I was carrying it around.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:11.520
So I got back to the car and I found, I think it's something to do with target practice on airplanes, but again I put it on Facebook.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:16.520
And I sent two photographs to one of the boys.

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:20.520
We got like a WhatsApp thing for photographs.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.520
So I sent it to him.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.520
Don't pick these up.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.520
It's afternoon.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:32.520
Anyway, within 15 minutes, Matthew, one of them, come back.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.520
He sent me some pictures.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.520
It's human.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:43.520
And I'm looking at these pictures now and I'm looking at the bone and the sockets and all the rest of it.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.520
That's weird, Martin.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.520
I know.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:47.520
What are you doing?

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.520
I'm looking at it.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:53.520
So I found, we got in contact with one of the Coast Guard guys.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:58.520
Richard, he always wants, if you find a bomb, he wants to know and stuff like this.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.520
He keeps them in work.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:06.520
So I said, Rich, I think, I'm not sure I said, but one of the boys has just sent me a picture.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.520
And I've just phoned somebody.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.520
They might be human.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.520
He said, right.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.520
He said, well, do you want us to come down now?

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.520
I said, no.

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.520
He said, not tonight.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.520
No.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.520
I can't have the police up my house.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.520
So we'd sort it out tomorrow.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.520
So they come down to Blackrock.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.520
I brought it down there and they took it off.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.520
But only yesterday.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.520
I didn't say nothing about it.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:30.520
But yesterday, he texted and said, it's not a human remains.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.520
So it's not.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.520
God knows what it is.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.520
It is then.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.520
You'd be a big, big cow or something.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.520
A sheep or something.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.520
No, I didn't know.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.520
No, you wouldn't, would you?

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.520
And the more you looked at the pictures, it looked...

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.520
You were convinced.

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.520
Yeah, we all...

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.520
And Matthew then texted me.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.520
He was still out there.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.520
He said, I've got it in the back of the car.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.520
I said, I've been carrying it around for now.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:58.520
And he said, how big is it?

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:02.520
And I put a tape on it when I got home.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.520
And I sent it in the measurements.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.520
And I woked it off my phone, but it was absolutely comical.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.520
Matthew was a big lump.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.520
And he's there in his kitchen now.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.520
He's measuring it.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.520
And then he said, I think it's human.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.520
The way he said it.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.520
See, that thing's just...

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.520
But yeah, a day in the life of somebody.

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.520
Have you seen bodies out there?

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.520
Richard found one, yeah.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.520
Richard found Derek Upton.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:33.520
He found two.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.520
He found one on the way.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.520
He was canoeing, kayaking up the way.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.520
And he came across one.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.520
And he phoned the coast guard.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.520
And they sent Sarah out.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.520
And they said, can you hold on to it?

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.520
He said he's drifting away.

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:50.520
So you have to sort of catch hold of it with a stick or something.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.520
Oh, dear.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:55.520
And then, a few years back now, Richard was...

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.520
Derek Upton, I don't know if you heard of him.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.520
He's a big guy.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.520
He was involved with a lot of the findings out there.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.520
He was kind of like a pill fella.

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:08.520
And he used to take the archaeologists out there.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.520
Sort of off Goldcliff.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.520
They found these footprints and all the rest of it.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.520
And he spent a lot of time out there.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.520
He knew it like the back of his hand.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.520
Like if you were arrested.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.520
And he don't know what happened.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.520
They don't know the personal side of it.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.520
But anyway, eventually he went down there.

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.520
He shot himself.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:32.520
So he shot himself down on the foreshore.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.520
And I think they found the rifle.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.520
But they couldn't find his body.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.520
So they searched around a bit for it.

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:44.520
Sent a few search parties down there for a week or so.

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.520
And no sign of him.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.520
They just assumed he'd gone.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.520
Anyway, my brother was down there doing what we do, I think.

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.520
And he found the body.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.520
Didn't have a mobile.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.520
So we walked up to the phone box.

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.520
Said he found the body.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.520
And within seconds he was like, please guess.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.520
A grim discovery though.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.520
That must impact on him a bit.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.520
Yeah.

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.520
Not very nice.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.520
So yeah, Richard, when we was talking to him.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.520
He said there's still, when we set up the pelvic bone.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.520
He said there's still three or four in the cabinet for us.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.520
There's people jumping off the bridges all over the place.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.520
Did people jump off the bridge?

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.520
Oh God, yeah. All the time.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.520
What, the Seven Bridge?

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.520
No, the other one generally.

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.520
I think he said about the Clifton Bridge.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.520
I don't know if they put barriers up on the Clifton.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.520
They try and stop people jumping off.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.520
But they don't publicise it anymore.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.520
Because it happens quite often.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.520
It puts it in people's minds, doesn't it?

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.520
I had no idea that happened.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.520
People are jumping off every day, but it's several a year.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:59.520
It's very sad. Desperate people must feel to do that.

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.520
Yeah, it is sad.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.520
Changing subject.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:08.520
What about knots? Were you taught knots?

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.520
Because you were using your boat in your morgue.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.520
Obviously to knit the nets.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:19.520
Using the sheet bend to knit the nets.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.520
You're using a sheet bend.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.520
Sheet bend.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.520
As in bed sheet.

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:30.520
Knitting the net around the wand and the needle and everything.

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:34.520
That's basically as far as late net fishing.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.520
That's the only knot you need to know.

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.520
Because I got an interest in boats.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.520
I mean bow lines and stuff like that.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.520
Clove hitches.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.520
It's part of it.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.520
Boating.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.520
About women. Did you ever get women to knit fish?

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.520
No, never.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.520
It's not a reason why they couldn't do it.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.520
It's not a reason why they couldn't do it.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:05.520
I've never known anybody, not a woman, do that.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.520
No.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.520
What about words that go with the area?

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.520
The estuary, the black rock, the levels.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:17.520
Any particular words that, like you said about the guts for example?

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:22.520
Well yeah, I mean there's the monkey temp.

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:26.520
Which is behind a reef that's behind that hole.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.520
There's quite an interesting story with that.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.520
What year it would have been I just don't know.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.520
But around war time, sort of that time.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:44.520
Four soldiers stole the boat from the fishermen.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:52.520
And they tried to get a couple of girls from the village to sort of go in the boat with them.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:57.520
And in the end the girls didn't go.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.520
Anyway the soldiers went off in the boats.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.520
And the guests from the bay.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.520
And rode out into the estuary.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.520
And landed on what they call the monkey temp.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.520
At lower tide.

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.520
Got out of the boats.

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.520
Started to walk around the reef, the island.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.520
Didn't secure the boat.

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:25.520
The tide started to come back in and wash the boat away.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:32.520
And Bob used to say that if they watched them, they couldn't do nothing.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:39.520
So the tide came in and people were saying, get another boat, go and get them.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.520
They just sort of said, too late.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.520
Why?

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.520
Too late, they couldn't get to them.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.520
Because the tide is so strong?

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.520
Because the tide is coming in so fast.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.520
And they just watched them.

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.520
How awful.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.520
Oh my god.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.520
Drammed all of them.

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.520
All of them lost.

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.520
Was it called monkey temp before that?

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.520
No, we don't know where the name monkey temp came from.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.520
But generally the monkey temp comes up.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:12.520
It's an indication of the time when you start to see the monkey temp come up in the distance.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:19.520
That's when you set off from the bay to go to the hole in the boat to start fishing.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:24.520
There's another stone out there called, just again close to the hole.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.520
Called the sugar cube.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.520
Sugar cube.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.520
It's a big, massive square rock.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.520
There's two ways of getting out to the fishing.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.520
If you're going to fish a grand stand in the hole.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:43.520
And that was either by boat and you're looking for the monkey temp coming up.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:51.520
If you're wading from the shore outwards, you stand on the edge of the water as the tide is going out.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:55.520
And then you start to see the top of the sugar cube up here.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.520
As the tide is ebbing.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:03.520
And as soon as the top of that stone starts to show, that's when you're starting to wade out.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.520
That's what you're looking for all the time.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.520
So you know exactly the right signs and timings.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.520
You're reading it all the time, aren't you?

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.520
Yeah.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.520
There's certain things you look for all the time.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:24.520
When you're fishing out in Gruggy, which is mid-channel, close to the main shipping channel.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.520
You can get cut off quite easily.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:31.520
When you're on foot, you're going to drown if you don't come back at the right time.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:38.520
So what you're looking for is the tide rising in the shipping channel.

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.520
That's what you do.

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:42.520
People, if you're looking around you, you think the tide is not coming in.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.520
But what we do is pick out black.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.520
You're looking for black.

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:47.520
That's what they say.

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:51.520
Look for the black, which is stone.

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:58.520
So as the tide is ebbing, you can imagine, you get a rock shot.

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:01.520
And then you wait a little bit longer.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:04.520
And then you look beyond that for another rock.

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.520
And then another rock will start to show.

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.520
And you keep looking beyond and beyond and beyond.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.520
And you're looking down into the shipping channel.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.520
And then you're looking around.

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:16.520
And then you look glanced back.

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.520
And that rock is gone.

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:22.520
So that's the only indication you've got that the tide is coming in.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:27.520
Because you can't see around you, where you've come from, to the east or the west.

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.520
You're just looking at that.

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.520
So when the tide is starting to rise now,

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:35.520
and that's your first indication of you've got to be thinking of leaving.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.520
So you're reading that all the time?

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.520
Yeah.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.520
The most important thing is safety.

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:45.520
And they say if you see a fish at the end,

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.520
when the time comes to leave, you leave.

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.520
You don't sort of hang about.

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:54.520
So you're constantly reading the water, looking at the turn of the tide.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:58.520
And when I was a kid, I mean, you could actually hear it.

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:02.520
I can always remember, I'm going back a long time, but...

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.520
Before the bridges?

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.520
Before the bridges.

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.520
Before the bridge.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.520
If you hear the bridge now, you can hear the drone and the traffic.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:12.520
And sometimes it's a lot worse than that in the fishing areas.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.520
You can be stood in the hole and fishing,

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.520
and I could be there with my eyes closed,

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.520
and I would know exactly when to come back.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:24.520
Because not only are you looking, I would know exactly when to come back.

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:28.520
Because what happens in the estuary is that when the tide starts to flood,

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:31.520
you don't sort of just pour in straight away.

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.520
It's as if you reach a sort of a level.

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.520
The tide starts to rise and rise and rise and rise,

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.520
and then it reaches a point and it goes...

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.520
Like that, and it starts to come in.

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:46.520
So, as long as it's flowing, flowing out,

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:50.520
you will always hear the water going over the rocks.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.520
All right? So you're listening.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:56.520
So if you were blind, you couldn't see, you would hear it.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:00.520
That ripple in, that water going over the rocks.

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:03.520
When everything becomes equal,

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:09.520
for 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, there's no noise.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:13.520
So you know then, just before it's going to tip.

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.520
That's interesting.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:19.520
So that sense was heightened even more so when the bridge wasn't there.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:20.520
Yeah, exactly.

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.520
You could hear it much better.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:27.520
Yeah, it was a definite sort of thing that you would listen for.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.520
The turn of the tide sort of thing.

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:34.520
But with the background noise, that's sort of lost now.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.520
If you really, really sort of listen for it, you can...

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:44.520
Yeah, but it was, like you say, well defined and sort of before the bridge was there.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:48.520
So this is your chance now to tell me anything I haven't asked.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:52.520
Or also what this place means to you.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.520
Well, the fishing.

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.520
Black rock.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:00.520
Black rock, it means everything to me.

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.520
It really does. It's sort of...

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.520
Had I not been taken out fishing when I was a kid,

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.520
I mean none of this would be here.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:13.520
I never thought it at the time that I'd ever be here,

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:17.520
all these years trying to hang on to the fishing.

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:21.520
It's a massive part of my life sort of thing now.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:25.520
And who would have ever thought it?

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:28.520
It was tetra on the brink of going.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:34.520
And the hard work that I put in, my brothers put in, the other fishermen have put in.

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:39.520
And sort of it just means everything to me, really.

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:44.520
And I just hope it stays forever.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:47.520
But yeah, a massive part of my life.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.520
It's become more so as I've got older.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:54.520
When you appreciate things that have, you know...

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:59.520
It's a material world, but some things are worth more than money.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:04.520
And this is a gift to me, really.

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:10.520
When the fishing time comes, you can't think of anything else, really.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.520
It's like drawn.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:19.520
Like the moon draws and the sun controls the tides, the drag.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:24.520
The tide, you sort of get drawn to the estuary as well.

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:27.520
It's a massive part.

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:33.520
I wouldn't say I'd be lost without it, but it would be a crying shame if it went.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:35.520
It really would.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.520
There's no reason for it to go.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.520
We have no effect on stock at all.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.520
I'm proud of the way things are now.

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:50.520
It's become not just a big thing for me, it's become a big thing for the village, the county, everything.

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:57.520
I could never have imagined how things would have turned out.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:04.520
Heritage fishery, tourist attraction, I suppose.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:13.520
We've given a lot back to Mormon ship, one way or another, and Wales.

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.520
It does really mean everything to me.

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:18.520
It really does.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:24.520
There's nothing else I'd rather be doing, really, than leave the estates.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.520
Thank you.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.520
It's only been quite emotional.

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:33.520
It is, I mean, it is.

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.520
It's quite an emotional subject, really.

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.520
There's a lot to lose.

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:43.520
We fought hard to keep it, and we're still fighting even now.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.520
Who knows?

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.520
It's out of my hands.

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.520
What will be will be.

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.520
Watch this space.

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.520
We'll give it your best shot next week.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.520
Yeah, we do. We'll certainly do that.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.520
Thanks, Martin.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.520
It's all right.

00:37:58.520 --> 00:37:59.520
Thank you.

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.520
No problem.
