Yeah, change of view patterns, in the sense you don't get any Welsh programmes on BBC One anymore, do you?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Which we used to get, and I couldn't complain about it, you're an incomeer aren't you?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
You can't come to Wales and say, oh I don't like the Welsh language, or you know, big fuss about that.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But what I used to find, it used to annoy the non-Welsh speaking Welsh people, of which I worked with.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But I can always remember the TV, I think about 20 to 7, it would chop and you'd say, oh now it's heavy.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So you'd switch over to something else.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But S4C as such hasn't affected my view at all, except for the fact there's no Welsh programmes on.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Although they do have some subtitles sometimes, and Poblokwm's very popular isn't it?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I don't watch, but I know I've got English speaking friends who do, and they think it's great.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
But no, Cilly Artists, no it hasn't, no, no.
