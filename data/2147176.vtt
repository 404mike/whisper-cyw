00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, you ready? Comfortable?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Yes, I'm fine.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Again, you can talk to myself or the camera is totally up to you.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
However, you are comfortable. Do you want a glass of water or anything?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
No, no, I'm fine. Yes, I'm fine.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So, first is up.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What do you... Can you first of all give me your name?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Yeah, my name is...

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And where you were born?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
My name is Musharraf Hussein.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I was born in Pakistan.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
My date of birth is 1950.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
But on my passport, I'm 1949.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And I educated in my own country. I did GCSE.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I belonged to a middle class family.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
But all my family is very educated.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
My brothers, sisters, everyone, they're all professionals.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I came through...

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I had a good life in school and I've been in a college as well.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You know, back home.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Let's talk about some of that then.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Right, yeah.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Do you remember what your childhood in Pakistan was like?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It was... It was all time. It was very good.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
At first we were very free. There was no restrictions.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We played with the boys. We played with the girls.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We went out. We played in the house.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
We went to the village.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
You know, we did all sort of things.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
What was the enjoyment that time was available.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
We did all that. All that.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
What was it like for you to grow up there?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
What kind of fond memories do you have?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It wasn't... We belonged to a very religious family.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
It was average.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
We used to do everything in Ramadan.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
We used to have our fasting.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And we used to pray in the morning and pray at night.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And when we were in school, my mum was very strict.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And we got to do everything on time.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We got to do our homework.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
We got to do some religious study.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
We got to do housework and school and college.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Whatever was available and shared with the family.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I always belonged to that.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
We were eight members, eight brothers and sisters in the family.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And my mum and dad.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
My dad was an engineer in the biscuit factory.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Back home, Pakistan.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
My dad was an engineer.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And my mum was a housewife.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
She brought us very, very well.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
In a very good way and in discipline.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
We wasn't left out for a while.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
What part of Pakistan is this?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
That time we lived in Sahiwal.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
That was near Lahore.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
It was between Lahore and Multan.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Do you remember school?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Yes.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
What education?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I was in a pilot school.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I educated in a pilot school.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
There was an English medium.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
It was all Urdu.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
After class five, like you can say eleven,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and then we learned English as a subject.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
But before that, it was all Urdu medium.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
We used to have a math area, we used to have science, we got social studies, you know, all that.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
But that was in our own language.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Did you have a favourite subject?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Or one?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I can't remember now.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
It's a long time.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
How about playing?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Do you remember playing?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
What did you have fun games?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Did you enjoy playing as a child?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Yes.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I used to play all with the families, but not in a school.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
I didn't play anything in school, no.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I wasn't.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
What kind of games did you play?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
What did you do to pass the time as a child?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Eh, brother and sister, you know, you just sit and play Ludo, and we play hide and seek.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
You know, just small plays that time.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
The media wasn't there, no gadgets, nothing.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
We hardly had, when we were little, we never even had a TV that time.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
TV came long time after.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:22.000
But we just played with the kids, like, you know, dolls and, you know, small things like, you know.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
So how about for celebrations, birthdays and weddings?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
What did you do? Tell me about some of those.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Tell me about some of those.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
We never, no, we never used to have any birthdays.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
No, we never.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
But we used to have a celebration.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000
We had an Eid, and we had weddings, and we used to dress up and go accordingly.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:51.000
What the people used to do, you know, we just go and just mix with them, and do the things like, you know.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:02.000
But actually, I was little, and I don't remember those sort of things, but it wasn't, that time, it wasn't very advanced.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.000
You know, it was, people had limited money and limited sources as well.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Just the same as everybody, you know, that time.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And that is my sixties, like, you know.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
You mentioned you pray in the morning, pray at night.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
That's right, yeah.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000
What are the traditions or practices, family day practices, do you remember?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Do you remember any family day activities when maybe Dan came home or when there was a wedding, did you do anything?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Do you remember any traditions and celebrations?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
No, we didn't do much that time.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Actually, when I came to this country, I was very young.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Actually, most of us, I adopt here.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
How big were you?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
No, I wasn't that young, young. I was eighteen.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I married and I came to this country, I was eighteen.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Because before that, I was in a school and I was in college.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I was busy studying, so I didn't have much activities like, you know, play with the brothers and sisters in a house or play with the friends.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
But it wasn't, not more than that.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
So let's go there, travelling to the UK.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
What made you arrive in the UK and what was it? Was it for work or study?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
If it was to study, what did you carry on studying?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Actually, my husband was my friend, my brother's best friend.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And we got married. I was only eighteen when I got married.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:50.000
I just finished my GCSE, you know, I was in the first year in A-levels.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And I got married and within two months, I came over here.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And the rest of the life I spent in here with my husband.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And after that, I started my family and I had my children.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Do you remember the first journey over?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
How did you feel when you were coming over, were you nervous?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Crying, crying, nervous because I came from the big family.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And when I came over here, I was on my own.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
I had no relatives. I didn't have no member of the family, only my husband.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
I didn't know anybody at all. It was a very, very bad experience.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Very, very bad.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000
That time there was no telephones back home here, like, you know, not in every household.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Actually, in here, people did have the phones in every household.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.000
We used to go to the public phone, you know, in the street to phone someone.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And there wasn't many phones that time. People were just surviving, you know, it was good like.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:11.000
The phone was only ambulance call or call someone, you know, very, very, very, very less.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Most probably you wasn't born that time, you know, when we came to this country.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
What year did you arrive here?

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:24.000
I came here 24th of February 1969.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
What do you remember of the temperature, the people, the food?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Very, very cold and snow and everywhere snow, mountains and snow.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
One finish, another one came. It wasn't finished, the other one was came.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Even in June and July, we used to have snow.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And in August this time, we used to have a water snow.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And we never thought about the jackets, never thought about sandals, never thought about.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
There was no jackets, only different coats people used to wear.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Good, it was very, very cold weather.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And big thick shoes like with a grip.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And hats and scarves, even when my children started school.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Like in September now, like next month the kids be going to school.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And we used to buy for them, you know, duffle coat and shoes and burleys and hoodies.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000
You know, it was that time, you know, it wasn't no heating in the houses.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
People used to burn coal.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
But fortunately, my husband had an English friend.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And when they saw I, when I came, I was very young.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And my husband put me in my house. I had a gas fire.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
I was lucky to have a gas fire in my house.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And I had a carpet in the room. And I had a new sofa.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000
But people, you know, around they come in and surprise, oh, you got a carpet in the room.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And you got a new sofa in the room.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And you know, that was a luxury life that time.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
People used to have only a piece of carpet in the middle of the room.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And the people used to burn coal.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
So it sounded like you had to adjust.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Yes, yes.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
How did you maintain or manage connections back home then?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
So was it letters? Was it a call?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Letters, letters.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Tell me a bit about how you maintained some sort of connection.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Actually, when I came, because I came from the big family.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And there was my some college friends and my school friends.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
And my own two younger sisters.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And every morning when I used to wake up,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
I used to run down the stairs because the bedroom was upstairs.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Run down the stairs if there's a post.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And we see a blue letter.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
It was an airmail.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
We used to say airmail letters, you know, the blue ones.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And come and, you know, this without wasting time,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
without taking a breath, you know, open and read all about the family.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And then sit down and most of it, we read about six times in a day.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:38.000
You know, just sisters and brothers missing me and telling me what happened.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000
So and so had a child, so and so is ill, so you know, all those sort of stories like.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And they used to write back letter.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
And I was on my own.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
I used to writing a letter.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
I'm crying.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
I go emotional about it.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And managed, managed, slowly managed.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000
What helped you manage?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
What helped you while you were here far, far away in a cold, cold land?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
What things helped you manage that process?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Was it people and places?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Actually, my husband, he was a very, very loving husband.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
He cared for me a lot.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
He cared anything and everything.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
So even I was lonely, I wasn't feeling that bad.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I was missing my family, but he used to do anything for everything for me.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
He was 10 years older than me.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
But he was a very nice person.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Can you tell me about maybe life here then?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Let's say the first five to 10 years.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
How did that feel?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
After two years when they came after two years, I gave birth.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I had a daughter.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
I came in 69, early 69 in February.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And in 70, my daughter was born.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And I was a bachelor and I got very busy as well.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.000
But before I came, my husband had some English friends, you know, the family.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And they didn't have any children, but there was, her name was Roma.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And her husband was Teddy and was Dad.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And they used to worry, they care for me a lot.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
They used to come every evening and sit with me and talk to me.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
I didn't know a lot of English at all.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Nothing.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
They used to come, because I was nearly married when they came.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Used to just talk.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
When I was speaking, I was speaking wrong.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
I didn't know anything about it.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
I only read a few books like, you know, English books.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
But my grammar wasn't very good.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
My speech wasn't very good, you know.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
And they used to come and sit by me and talk to me about this and that.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And what I used to do, when they were talking to me, I was correcting myself.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
What they saying, like I said something.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:35.000
I used a grammar past, but I was talking in presence.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And future, you know, so I didn't know.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
But when they used to sit and talk to me, what happened?

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
You shut up. What you do? What you do in Pakistan?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
What your sister does? What your brother does?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
You know, keep me going.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
And I learned.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:01.000
And very quick, very soon, I start speaking.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And I became independent.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Like some people took them years and years and maybe 10 years and 20 years.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
But my husband let me go.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
He said, if I went, first time I went to the doctors, he went with me.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
You know, registered me in.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Next time I went, I had a flu or something.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
He went with me in a drug procedure.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
He sat on the bench and he said, you go.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And I said, what to say? I don't know.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
He said, no, you go.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Explain to him what's wrong with you.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
I said, I will say something wrong.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
He said, oh, Macha, you say wrong.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
He will understand.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000
If you won't understand, then he might call me and I'll come and explain.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:05.000
And very quick, I start taking my own weight on my feet.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
And I had one child, two, three, four.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
I had four children.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
No, and my husband started a business.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
I started helping him as well.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
He had a shop, ladies wear fashion.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
And I used to go to one place and my husband used to go to the different one.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
And my kids started going to school and all that.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Slowly, I became a bit independent.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
My kids grown up and I thought I must do something.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:49.000
And I had some, I had a training, teachers training.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:18:01.000
And after I became a teacher, I taught in different high school, Urdu language, the kids.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:10.000
And while I was there, I became, I worked for government.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000
I worked for social services in a child protection team.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
I worked there a few years.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
And whatever I could grapple, I was doing it.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
I worked in a crush a couple of years.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
I did home caring.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
I did fostering.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
I did multi-skills.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000
And I started cooking and I did some catering as well.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
And wherever I got a chance to learn something, I went for it.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
And I did it.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
And now it's all around.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Pensioner.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
But I had a lot of experience in my life.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
What was the UK like?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Can you remember in the 70s, 60s, 70s, what was UK like?

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:12.000
It was like, when you think about the Newport, I can tell about the Newport, and a bit of Cardiff.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
This Newport was different altogether.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:23.000
This building started in 1974.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
1974, they started this building.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
On the bridge there was nothing.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
There was shops when it came very first.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000
On the bridge there was shops there all the way till the roundabout.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
And where is the roundabout?

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
There was a lights, satellites.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
And go straight and there was a high street.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
There was shops there and there where the King's Head Hotel is.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
I know all Newport.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:05.000
The library built after, Kings were built after, and they...

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
You know, Kings, what they done?

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
They built in shops.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Long time ago there was a Tesco.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
They knocked that down and they made in shops.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:24.000
And after that, there's a Friar's Womb now.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Dublin was in there.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000
What was the... I mean, back in the 60s, 70s as well, there was more Asian people arriving?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
There wasn't that many people.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000
There were Pakistani people, but there was very few Bengalis.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Bengali families wasn't that much.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
There was a lot of Pakistani people.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
And they was all from villages.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000
And they... they was much older than me.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Like you can say my father's age, you know.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
And they was all illiterate.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
They couldn't speak.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
The wives couldn't speak English, not a word of English.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
And the men, they all worked in the factories.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
There was a girl in factories and there was...

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
there was a crunch and something.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:29.000
There was a battery factory with that transporter bridge on the other side of that.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
And there was a lice shed.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000
There was a quite big factory, Spencer Wigs.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:42.000
And it was different altogether.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
This one is all new.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:54.000
But old one, I can just close my eyes and I could see what was there.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
Because I seen it with my own eyes.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
And I saw it alteration.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000
You know, they altering this one.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
They demolishing this one, putting a new stuff there.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
They demolishing there, putting a new stuff there.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
And like that River French wasn't there.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
They used to have sand ships.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
They come there and they empty all sand.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
And people buy sand from there, you know, for the buildings.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
So you've raised four children here, is that correct?

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
That's right.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Yeah, so...

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
My children got children.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Tell me about what it's like to raise children here and how they connect to Pakistan.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Do they or how they?

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Actually, it was alright.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Because I didn't have many difficulties.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000
I was...

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
How I can say?

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:07.000
I altered myself according to the culture.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Not in very advanced way, but where it was needed.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Where it was a good things, I adopted that.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
But I didn't let adopt my kids the bad things.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
And I didn't adopt the bad things.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
You know, to be a Muslim.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:33.000
So you got to go accordingly, like my daughters, I had two daughters.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
I didn't let them go to westernize, not as now the English people are.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
They wouldn't let them, the way they close, the way they were.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
I wouldn't let them out like that in the evening.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
No, there's a limit.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
So, I mean...

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Mementos and heirlooms.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Do you have mementos and heirlooms that exist from back then?

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Things that you prize.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
It doesn't have to be a physical thing.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Maybe it's a practice or a photograph.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Do you have things that you maintained from Pakistan?

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
I used to go every year, normally see my family.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
When I came after that, my family went to live in Islamabad.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
But Islamabad is a very modern city.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
It's like here.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
So there's nothing backward, nothing.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
It's very, very advanced.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
It's like London, you can say.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
It's a very advanced city.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Everything is new.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
It's a brand new city.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
And it's becoming better and better all the time.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
So I always went there.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000
My kids went there.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
So my children didn't have any bad experience from there.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
They love to go and see the family.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Because my family is educated.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
And they learned the good things, you know, nothing bad.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
So I'm proud of it.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.000
I fit there as good as what I fit here.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
That's good.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
That's a type of integration.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Question is, do you have any photographs or memorabilia, letters, documents

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
that you may be happy to put in the People's Collection website?

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
So the IGER is the People's Collection is a massive website

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
of stories of thousands of people that moved here from around the world

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
and different things.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
And in amongst there, there'll be like a transcript of the interview,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
some audio, maybe a picture of yourself.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Do you have anything you may want to add to that?

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
I've got to see.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:55.000
I most probably have got some photographs, but not a very old one.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
They're probably in the 70s and 80s.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Yeah, that's right.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Maybe like only those sort of photos, like with my kids,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000
or in a party, or in a house, or on birthdays, you know, something like that.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.000
But nothing more than that.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
What would you like to pass on to your children and grandchildren

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.000
that would sum up your life in the UK?

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Actually, I have got eight grandchildren.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:43.000
My one grandson, he's 27, and he's graduated.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:52.000
He did a master two years ago in HR, and he works in London.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
He works in Canadian E-Walk offices.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Is there something you would like to pass on to them, a message,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
or if they come back to visit this interview in 20, 30 years,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
anything you would like to say to them?

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
I won't be here.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
This is why they were interviewing, anything you would like to say to them,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
or mention to them?

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:23.000
My son, and my daughter, and my daughter is 23.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
My daughter is 53.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
And the eldest son is 31, my eldest daughter.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000
And then I have another daughter, and I have got a son.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
My daughter got three boys.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:57.000
My son got four daughters, and my youngest son, he got just one boy, 19 years.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Is there something else you would like to add to all this?

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:06.000
And my husband is a very nice man, very, very nice man, religious and everything.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:13.000
We've been to, we've been quite a lot of time.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
We've been to Hunch, and we've been to Omra.

It's not only religious tours we've done.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
We've been to Cheikh, if you chime.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
We've been to Spain once.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
We've been touring everywhere.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
We went to Scotland.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
We went here and there, holidays.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
It wasn't we only concentrated on our house.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000
We really had a good life, very, very nice life, Mashallah.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
And now, four years now, my husband passed away.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000
That's it. I'm on my own now.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000

One my sons and his son, and one my daughters' son.

They want to, they don't want me to live on my own, so they are living with me.

Well, thank you very much.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Is there anything else you would like to put on the record?

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000
I don't know.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
It's what you think.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000
I think that's great.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
I have missed anything.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
No, we asked all the questions.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
We talked about your experiences.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
We talked a bit about heirlooms and mementos.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Actually, when I was years ago, I worked for, I'm forgetting things now.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
I worked for GEMS, actually.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000

And I can speak Hindi as well.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
And that is fluent.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
I don't know what you thought about my English.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
I don't know.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
It seems like Asian English.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Like, you know, you think I speak fluent.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Like, you know, anybody can understand me.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Are there any mistakes?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
I don't think so.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
I can understand you.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
So, yeah, thank you very much.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
That's almost 40 minutes.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
If there's nothing else.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Anything else?

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
No, we've gone through all the lists here about your experiences arriving.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:31.000
We talked about, yeah, customs.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Yeah, we've gone through everything here.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Just a few questions from Roy.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.000
How did you hear about A.J. Live and how was it introduced to yourself?

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Actually, about more than 20 years ago, 25 years ago,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000
we used to go to a place called Asiana.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
It was in a community house.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
We used to go there that time.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
We based that place.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Rahila used to run that.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
And we named that place Asiana.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000
And after that, we used to go there and all.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000
And then we used to go to the one club.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
You hear about the other one.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000
You know, so and so, so and so.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000
And then, now about more than 12, 13 years now,

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
since I've been going to A.J. Live.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
You know, from there.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000
Did you know anything about A.J. Live before?

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Or did you just arrive?

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
No, when I arrived there.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000
But I was an actor member.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
I used to participate in everything.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Like, you know, there's the parties.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
And it was anything, organizing, wherever we going.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
I was the one, you know, always ready, my hands up.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
But now I am a bit slow with age.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
And I have got health issues, quite a few health issues.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:07.000
So now I go, but not as much as, you know.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
So what has it meant to you as a group, as a collective,

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
as a community project?

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
What has A.J. Live meant to you being a Newport resident?

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
Good.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
I never thought to go anywhere else.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
I don't want to.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
I spent all my life here, actually.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
You know, I was, I would say, more or less,

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
I was a teenager when I came to this country, you know.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
And I grew up, I learned everything afterward,

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
you know, after I got married.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Before I didn't know much about it.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
I mean, that was my experience.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000
I learned everything, anything and everything from here,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:55.000
from people, with my life experience, with my partner.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Because my partner was a great partner.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
That's it. Thank you very much.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Thank you very much.
