00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.240
I was born on the 11th of the 1st 1930 in Welshpool and I lived in Welshpool until I

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.240
went into the RAF at 20 years of age.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:21.320
I came out of the Air Force in 1952 and I bought my old ironmonger shop down Bridge

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.040
Street and we came to move into the big house that was part of the business.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:32.800
My father always used to come to Lambullin on a Thursday which was market day in Lambullin.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.960
He had some very good friends at that time and these were on singing together.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.520
My father was a real singer, he followed anywhere for a singing and spent the afternoon there

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.720
with the master of the dolly.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.960
He was a big singer and they'd go everywhere, they had a choir in Lambullin.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.680
Actually he'd have some of the inmates of the dolly in the choir and my father would

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.800
go and pick them up and help to take them to wherever they went.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.480
I mean little villages and singing around the place but it kept the inmates, I don't

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.480
like that word.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.640
Well they kept them happy, they went out for a little bit of an evening out and a cup of

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.920
tea singing at the different villages and they got on well together.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.440
There were some young people there as well, people that were homeless because circumstances

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.920
made it that way, nothing else.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.720
And then there was some of the tramps they used to call him in my young day, I remember

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.200
one George the Tramp we called him and he used to do the garden for us when we were

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.720
living down Bridge Street and he did it for a good many years and I think all he used

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.160
to come for was to come for a meal that's what he said because he used to come in his

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.080
dinner ready and I go to be a little loved if he'd sit in the household, it's raining

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.640
today, he'd say I can't go out.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.480
So he'd sit there all day with us.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.120
And then at night he went back to the dolly?

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.680
At night he'd probably have to have somebody take him down in the car or something or he

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.760
could slip away and have a pint.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.360
Can you remember the name of the person who came after?

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.240
Davies his name was.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.240
William Thomas Davies?

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:17.680
He had a son Ryan he was Ryan and they were on the telly call and they were both beautiful

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.680
singers.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.560
I can see him standing on the street in Lanluttenia now, he's standing outside where the spa

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.560
used to be.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.800
He'd be standing on the corner and he would always dress the part of an actor or something

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.800
like that.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.640
He'd have one of these trench coats, a silver hat, a cigarette in his hand and he used to

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.640
talk to him for ages.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.920
Before long they'd have a gang around and they'd be all singing and before you could

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.280
say anything half the Count Valley or they'd be coming out and joining the choir outside.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.560
It was great days in those days, Lanluttenia was a great place to live.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.760
So that would be sort of late 50s?

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.040
Late 50s, early 60s.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.520
It sounds from what you're saying the town had a good relationship with the Dollies.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.600
There wasn't any bad relationship, I think there were a lot of snooty people living in

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.600
Lanluttenia.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.120
They didn't like to be associated with the Dollies.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.200
Well that's what they called it in Lanluttenia, the workhouses and of course that didn't

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.200
go down with them.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.920
So you'd say there were mixed attitudes then?

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.720
Mixed attitudes yes.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.560
It had quite a bit to do with the Dollies because you know when they'd garden stuff,

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.960
the seeds and things we used to deliver it down and anything they wanted from the Iron

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.160
Wungry that we used to sell we used to go down there, go in and have a cup of tea with

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.160
them.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.040
We used to have a lot of laughs with them down there.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.800
Really they were some real comedians.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.920
Do you remember it as being full?

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.040
Oh yes, yes, a lot of people.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.160
On the whole I think they all got on pretty well together.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.440
They had a good home there.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.960
It was a bit rough and ready but they had good food.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.600
They were restricted to a few hours and things that they did, some of them didn't like.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.400
They liked to be able to walk up to the pub at night going out fighting and perhaps they'd

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.760
forget to come back.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.520
They got on very well with people indeed.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:26.640
In the forest, the forest church mouses we used to say, you could always get on and this

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.640
is both nicely to them and treated them as it.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.160
There used to be one old chap.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:41.560
I think he stopped in the Dollies in the winter but he used to sleep under the stars through

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.680
the summer.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.080
He could tell you some tales he could tell you but it was nearly all in Welsh.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.360
He used to say the most beautiful poetry so I'm told.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.360
All self-taught.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.000
They say if you could understand it, something they did was, but there was a little to his

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
voice as well like he.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And he was a chap of about six foot four.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
A big chap and he built like a tank.
