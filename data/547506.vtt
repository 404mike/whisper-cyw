00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I am lost and clear and I, a girl near all I miss.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I am lost and clear and I, a girl near all I miss.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I am lost and clear and I, a girl near all I miss.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I am lost and clear and I, a girl near all I miss.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:43.000
From angels bending near the earth to touch their hearts of gold.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Peace on the earth would build to him, a man of gracious king.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:11.000
A world in silence, clear as day, to hear the angels sing.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
In Welsh, Alhananos and Gleed and Thar.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Here, a free one.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I am lost and clear and I, a girl near all I miss.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:45.000
It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:58.000
From angels bending near the earth to touch their hearts of gold.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And I am in this covered place, round down my rock in hell.
