00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600
Do you ever think you would go back to South Africa?

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.360
I would.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:15.760
At the moment I want to just pack my bags and just go over and never return.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.280
But I know for a fact that if I do that I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing now.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.360
I wouldn't be independent.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.720
I wouldn't be working.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.880
I wouldn't be jumping on public transport.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:42.280
So in that respect I think I am lucky to be here.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:50.200
If I could just pack my friends in my bag, miniaturise them and pack them in my bag and

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.800
bring them over here I think I'd be happy.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.200
I own the sunshine as well.
