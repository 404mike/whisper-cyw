hands the size of saucepans you know a gardener at the hall his life really friendly friendly bloke

but you know would sit in the happy union smoking his pipe in the same seat in the in the corner

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:46.080
and always you know just a friendly tale to tell so we've just got lots of people that are

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.920
our characters Glyn the Dolly which is a new house at Lace Dee but he's called Glyn the Dolly

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:59.440
um and was nicknamed the uh the what was what did Paul the Hall call him it was the Russian

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:07.120
Ministry of Agriculture Russian Minister of Agriculture and even when he was shaved he had

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:14.880
hairs coming out of his shirt and on his neck and um and a big bear of a man that would have an open

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.760
shirt and a string around his trousers um all the year round whatever the weather and he was the

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.120
one man that you had to avoid on new year's night otherwise he'd be kissing you men and all

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.400
with these great he'd rub your face raw with his his big hug and a kiss wonderful chap you know

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:43.200
we just have lots of them you know and and I think it's those people that um make a place

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.280
but actually Abraham was named after two local characters so um you've got A.B. Wusencraft who

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.600
is still with us and lives just over the the hill along the Llewyn Lane over there and he

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:05.680
still comes to church and A.B. Menace-Lise which is a farm up on the hill by Lace Dee again up there

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:14.400
and he was such a character a gentleman a really thin wiry man that used to wear a little spotted

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.880
bow tie and he was a well traveled man a very well read and well spoken um farmer

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.880
and between the two of them we knew these two Abrahams and I just thought oh what a strong

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.360
name two strong characters and that's why we named him Abraham
