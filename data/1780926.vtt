WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
So I wonder if you can just say who you are and where we are.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.280
Right, I'm Martin Morgan and I'm secretary of the Black Rock Labenet Fisherman's Association,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.520
an association of traditional salmon fishermen founded by my great grandfather William Corbyn

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.960
on his return from the First World War.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.400
Now I didn't know that.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.800
Yeah, that's...

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.520
He did...

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.400
They fished before that, but when they returned from the First World War...

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.240
Can I switch this a bit closer, Martin?

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.040
Sorry? Yeah.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.880
Just so I'm sure it picks it all out.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.640
When he returned from the First World War, they fished prior to going off to war.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.160
He was one of four brothers from Chepstow that went to war.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.040
And he grew up in Chepstow.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.400
His nickname was Nester because he climbed the cliffs of Chepstow,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.320
the Chepstow Y, collecting seagulls' eggs for food.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.400
And that was his nickname.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.080
And his paddy trick was to jump off the railway dive, actually,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.600
off the railway bridge that goes across the Y.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.000
Are you kidding me?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.280
That was when he was a young boy.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.720
That's fantastic.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.920
When they returned from the war, they found that the fishery had been let

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.520
by the Y board, I think it was, at the time, on the fishery,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.440
to a guy from Gloucester, a merchant from Gloucester, called Purcell,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.160
Mr. Purcell.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.680
And there's records of this in the Newport Museum, I think,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.000
or the records office.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.920
When they returned, it had been let by the Y board to this Purcell fella.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.080
And he said to them, you can fish in the fishery,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.640
but you've got to sell the fish to me at my price.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.880
So obviously, they weren't going to have that.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.320
And there's records of a little bit of a fight they wrote to their MP

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.000
in the day, and the sort of powers that be.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.920
And it's unclear what happened, but shortly afterwards,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.720
they obtained a lease of such and such a board.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.240
So they got the fishery back.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.480
What year was this?

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.600
This would have been around about 1920.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:25.440
So again, I've got a copy of the actual first lease of the fishery.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.440
From that day forward, people from Subrote Portscuit Caldicot

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.480
fished on what was the ancient name, was the Gruggy Rocks Fishery.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.040
And that was our local fishery.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:49.840
So every year up until we were stopped in 2007 or 2008,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.960
I can't remember which now.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.680
And they refused to.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.960
It became like a lease in inverted commas that was renewed every year.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.520
But there was no formal agreement other than the formal agreement taken out

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.560
all those years ago when my great grandfather took one out.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.760
So they then insisted that we had a lease.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.440
So they being?

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.680
Sorry, the Environment Agency Wales.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.640
The Environment Agency.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.680
So they refused to let us fish until we signed a lease of sorts.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.520
So that was negotiated.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.400
That's another story.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:36.800
Yeah, the fishery, there were nine licenses granted by the Wye Board.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:46.880
As I say, people, my great grandfather, Brooke Beasley, John Mason,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.440
Herbert Williams, Bob.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.000
That's the names.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.640
It's a picture of him there in the net.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.040
They were some of the original fishermen back in the day.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:04.280
So when you say fishing, fishery, what sort of fish?

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.280
Right.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.880
The Grungy Rocks fishery and the Black Rock Lave Net fishery is a salmon fishery.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.800
That's simply that.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.240
That's what they were fishing for, salmon.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.120
It's not anything else.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:32.400
But adjacent to that, back in those days and up until roughly the,

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:39.520
I would say the early 80s, 1980s, there was people also fish with a type of lave net,

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.640
very similar, for whitefish.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.880
Now, there was no license required for that.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.760
No license at all.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.520
People just done it.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.040
It was a common sight.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.680
And if you spoke to anybody in the local villages,

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.920
they would fish for whitefish with a lave net.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.880
It's completely different to the salmon fishing.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.400
It's a completely different thing.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.240
Salmon fishermen wouldn't be seen dead fishing for whitefish.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.840
They were fishermen, proper fishermen, if you like.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:15.280
But people fished for whitefish, for food for the table.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.960
It wasn't a commercial fishery or anything.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.800
It was just subsistence.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:28.600
And those fish would have been mullets, soul, flounder, and eels, perhaps.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.360
It was done in a completely different area.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.360
It was a local area, just offshore.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.680
But there were different names for these areas, the lubi and the bar,

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.520
the bedwins and the lake.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.560
They were the whitefish fishing areas.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.600
But a completely different method, but a very similar net.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.440
Yeah, that was.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.080
So when you talk about licensing, this is licensing to fish for salmon?

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.040
Yes, yeah.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.280
You needed...

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:12.640
This fishery, this area is regarded, is said to be owned...

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.520
It's been handed down through...

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:22.240
I think it originally belonged to the St. Pierre manor house, the fishery.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.800
The fishing area, if you like.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:35.480
That was then gifted to the Wye Board, which then became the Rivers Authority, is it?

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.240
NRA.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:42.840
And then the Environment Agency, and now of late, Natural Resources Wales.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.440
So the title to the fishery has been handed down.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:53.480
So to fish in what is termed a private fishery, you need permission to fish.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.920
And that was, you know, in the Great Grandfather's Day lease agreement,

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:02.000
and then in Aero Day laterally, sort of a lease agreement, permission to fish.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.040
In addition to that, you then need a license to fish for salmon,

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.120
as a Ron Angler would, a license to fish for salmon.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.320
So, but you need the two things to be able to fish out here,

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.760
because it's deemed a private fishery.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:21.760
Now, in the late, I think, late 70s, early 80s,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:28.800
the River Board tried to prosecute somebody fishing for whitefish with a lathe net.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.040
Now...

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.800
Here?

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.080
Here, in Subrock.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.200
Toomla was handled the case, the solicitor.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.680
The guy's name was Ted Beaman.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.280
Now, as it happens, his nephew fishes with us.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.960
He's got a license to fish, you know, for salmon.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.520
But we can't get the information off him.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.200
We've been trying to get...

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.440
They reckon they win the case, but who knows?

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.160
You know, it's just sitting in the pipeline.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.320
We're going to try and get that information

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.840
regarding that sort of aspect of the fishing.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.560
But they tried to prosecute him.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.920
It went on for about five years, apparently, this case.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.880
Why?

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.520
So, but he must have had, what do you call it,

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.680
when you don't pay for legal advice.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.120
But, you know, again, that's another story.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.160
But it sort of died out anyway.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.520
You know, things changed.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.520
People, you know, drifted away from the estuary, perhaps,

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.000
certainly regarding getting fish.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.480
So, before your grandfather came here, what was here?

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.400
There was a fishery here?

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.120
People, local people, would have fished for salmon.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:45.360
There was no formal arrangement, as far as I understand,

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.080
that people would have fished for salmon.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.240
But people probably didn't know about it.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:56.240
You know, it was just coming from years, years and years back,

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.720
people just fished for salmon.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.680
They just went out there and fished for salmon.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.680
But then things, I think, started to get a little bit tighter.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.680
You know, perhaps after the First World War,

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.280
and things changed as such.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.760
Because the fishery,

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.040
my great-grandfather's day was secretive, super secretive.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:18.040
I mean, it was, how can you say?

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.160
They were told, they were explicitly told,

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.040
you know, or knew, not to talk about salmon fishing.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:27.880
Why?

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.200
Because of money.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.080
Because they got money?

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.920
People would be jealous.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.320
I don't know how much money was involved,

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.280
but they wouldn't brag about fishing.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.720
They wouldn't tell anybody about fishing.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.880
And even in my day, sort of when I was a kid,

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.920
if you walked up to Doug Brown, one of the fishermen,

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.680
said, any fish about Doug, he'd have one under his arm.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.400
And he'd say, no.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.960
They were that sort of, and fast.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.760
And nobody outside sub-Rook,

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.920
and possibly probably knew about lay net fishing

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.440
until I came into the fishery, and my brother.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.880
It was super secretive.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.880
So nobody would really have known about this fishery.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.600
So they were quite protective about it.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.160
Protected about the bounty?

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.000
It's, well, yeah, probably that.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.400
You know, it's their patch.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.840
You don't want anybody coming poachers, for instance.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.600
Once you start knowing that there's people,

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.760
there's fish there, and there's a way of catching fish,

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.040
and there's, you can get out there.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.440
You know, nobody, it was a deadly dangerous river.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.000
But if some people knew somebody was making money

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.000
by catching salmon, and there was a way of getting out there,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.120
they'd be watched, and people would follow them out there.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.560
So, you know, it's all, people just kept it close.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.520
And it was, as I say, up until, I would say,

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.400
probably, with our first war with the environment agency

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.280
in the late 90s, nobody knew about it

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.480
other than people, local people.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.320
And then-

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.400
That's really interesting.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.360
Yeah, it's, the only reason people know about it now

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.400
is because the environment agency tried to stop it.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.040
And it's been a, you know, a difficult thing,

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.520
but some good has come out of it.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.560
They sort of, you know, I first,

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:14.040
the license is, you know, I fished with the license first.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.040
Sorry, fished with the lead net first

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.640
in when I was about 10 years of age.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.680
I was born in 1960, so I was probably about 1970.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:27.920
With your dad?

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.080
No, all the fishing is on my mother's side of the family.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:36.080
So, my mother, my great-grandfather, William Corbyn,

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.840
and my grandfather, Jack Harris,

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.920
all the family grew up in the same house,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
13 Cam Road, Subrock, and that was known as HQ,

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.680
Immigrant Grandfather's Day.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.520
Really?

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.480
By locals and-

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.480
Yeah, everybody.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:57.480
Because all the salmon were taken to HQ

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.360
prior to being sent off to Billingsgate or wherever

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.760
back in the day.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.800
And they'd be tipped into a tin bath.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.320
My mother used to say that, you know,

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.480
she'd have to wait until the bath was empty

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.280
before they could have a bath.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:19.280
So, the back kitchen was where they brought the fish.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.240
What, like cart or?

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.440
No, no, well, carry it.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.600
They wouldn't have that many fish,

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.800
but they would just bring, any fish they caught

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.320
would be taken there and then taken off

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.840
to Port Ski with a station,

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.800
because there was a station there, you know,

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.840
going back to the 20s and 30s,

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.240
that sort of date, like, you know, sort of a long time ago.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.000
But 13 Cam Road, I spent a lot of time there

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.560
and sort of grew up there.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.240
I was always there, seeing my grandparents,

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.880
and there was always a lathe net there.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.160
My mother had three brothers,

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.200
and one of them was quite a keen fish,

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.360
well, actually two of them were fishermen.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.680
One was quite keen.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.560
They never had licenses, salmon licenses,

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.280
but they fished for whitefish,

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.080
and I'd always been nagging to be taken out.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.080
So, one beautiful summer's day,

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.800
I was taken out onto the estuary.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.480
In a boat?

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.040
No, we walked out from Severock across the Roman camp there,

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.680
down the foreshore, and then through the mud and gravel

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:31.680
out to a place they call the Luby, L-U-B-E-Y.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.680
And we fished the tide out,

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.160
and we stood on top of the camp,

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.880
and my uncle said to me,

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.880
as soon as the black stones show,

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.560
the black bedwinds start to show,

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.960
that's when we start walking.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.760
It was quite an easy walk then, sort of through the mud.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.440
I never had waders, I'm not quite sure if he did,

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:57.240
but you'd have an old pair of boots,

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.960
some jeans, and a T-shirt.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.920
And the way that was done,

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.920
you had a bit of a lathe net cobbled together,

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.800
nothing like a salmon fishing lathe net.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.760
The lathe net, was it a monofilament one,

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.840
or it was a XCM?

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.840
The one my uncle had was made from some sort of,

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.800
it wasn't hemp, I don't think, but it wasn't mono.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.280
But mine was made, basically made from garden sheeting,

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.600
so that it was just anything we could find to make it

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.000
knock up a bit of a lathe net for me,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.600
a little tiny makeshift, half-size,

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.600
tiny lathe net, just to have a go.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.360
So I was taken out, I fished.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.360
What you first do, you sort of get to

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.320
where the black bedwinds start,

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:45.480
and then you wait for a gravel bank called the bar,

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.440
B-A-R, to show.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.760
So you fish there for about 10 minutes.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.120
Because it's safe, you mean,

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.000
that's when you wait for it to...

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.360
The water level is dropping,

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.760
this is done on a spring tide when you fish a tide out, okay?

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.640
So you're waiting, you stood there,

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.200
the water's up to your waist.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.560
Oh my God!

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.200
And you stood there with a net in the water,

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.920
the same principle as the salmon fishing,

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.160
you put your hand in there and you feel for a fish.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.360
But you're not looking for a fish with,

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.480
when they fish for white fish,

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.840
you're just feeling for a fish going in there.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.560
And the first fish I caught was a green eel,

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.600
big green eel, about two pound.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.880
And he asked me if I wanted to keep it, I said, yeah.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.600
So I picked out the net and dropped it into a Hessian sack.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.400
Because again, that's what they used to use,

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.960
Hessian sacks over your shoulder on a string,

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.880
and put it in there.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.560
As the water level drops there,

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.080
you wade onto the bar,

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:45.080
and get onto the bar, which is a high gravel bank.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.480
And then you work your way down there as the tide is dropping.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.720
One interesting thing in those days was that

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.480
you'd probably catch a soul there,

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:58.040
which is, you know, don't get too many soul out there

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.360
in the late night.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.640
I've always floundered.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.040
But the interesting thing back in the day,

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.640
I can remember saying to him, why is the water red?

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.880
And he said, well, that's the mill, the baby mill.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.000
And so you're up to your waist in what was basically

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.080
the effluent from the mill.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:21.120
So the, and it was just pure red, and you could smell it.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.200
Why red?

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.280
Because that was the color of the effluent

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.680
that used to come out of the paper mill,

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.920
Ashton paper mill at the time.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:27.760
Really?

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.200
It was pumped out.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.440
They had a license to discharge effluent.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.280
So I think it was one hour or before,

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.480
and high tide, and two hours afterwards,

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.600
two and a half hours after.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.880
You know, don't quote me on that,

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.040
but it was roughly those sort of times.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.360
But they pumped it out 24 seven, forever.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.800
24 seven.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.720
And it was filthy down there.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.120
Dead zone, really.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.320
Sort of, but-

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.160
Gone now though, isn't it?

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.680
Gone now, it's been closed down for a few years now.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.760
It's houses being built on it at the moment.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.200
But I can remember saying to him, you know, what's that?

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.040
And he said, obviously, effluent from the mill,

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.520
but you know, it didn't bat an eye.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.960
They didn't think it bad for me to be studying it,

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.200
or I never knew about effluent or paper mills

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.920
and chemicals and all the rest of it.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.320
I'm still here to tell the tale.

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.400
So perhaps it wasn't that bad.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.160
What's, do you remember your impressions

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.320
being that first time?

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.920
Oh yeah, I mean, it was just a massive adventure.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.400
And you know, sort of, and he sort of planted the seed,

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.560
you know, sort of back then.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:34.560
And you fished in, and it was so exciting,

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.640
you know, waiting for that fish to sort of bump the net.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:41.520
And then you tied his head in a way,

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.040
you're walking down the bar,

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.800
and they said, right, time to go now.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.240
We walked to the next mark,

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.200
and you sort of walk back up the bar.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.960
It's now dry, and into what they call the luby.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:58.800
And again, it's like a channel, a channel that dries out.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.080
When you get there, it's quite wide,

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.960
not much tide running through it.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.840
Again, the interesting thing about that is that

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:12.840
where the tide in the estuary ebbs from east to west,

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.600
in the luby goes in the opposite direction.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.440
It runs out from west to east,

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.280
because in what it is, the higher ground to the west

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.200
of you is sort of draining out through this particular gully.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.760
And it's, I suppose, two or 300 yards wide at the start.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.800
And then as the tide, the ebbing tide goes on,

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.600
the current, the run gets faster in it.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.520
And then you start, the fish start to come down,

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.200
and back in the day, you might get 20, 25 flounder,

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.640
a couple of millet, perhaps.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.640
What are the dangers?

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.560
Dangers, I mean, you get washed off your feet.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.440
I mean, we hadn't heard of life jackets in those days.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.080
You sort of get cut off by the tide.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.760
Oh, God, you just, I mean, that's,

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.160
did that ever happen to you?

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.240
Cut off by the tide.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.800
When I was a kid, yeah, I mean, several times,

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.120
we never had tide tables, and sort of,

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.720
we'd be out there sort of playing, fishing,

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:17.360
collecting things, and just exploring generally.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.920
And several times, we had to swim across gullies,

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.040
and sort of, you know, sort of,

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.160
you just don't think anything of it, do you?

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.400
I mean, I learned to swim out there.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.200
I mean, it's, you know, your mother,

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.200
and all, keep out the estuary, keep out the estuary,

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.080
and there's, you know, a course of all the local boys,

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.160
that's where we spent all our time.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.000
In the estuary?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.920
In the estuary, sort of swimming, exploring,

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.160
fishing, digging bait, collecting, fishing tackle.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.840
I mean, that's where it all started for me, really.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.360
Sort of, you know, fishing with a rod and line, hand line.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.680
It's quite funny, really, out fishing with the boys

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.720
on the boat and everything, with rods and lines,

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.680
and, you know, I'm thinking to myself,

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.040
shall I say it, I first started with an hand line.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.440
You know, we didn't have a fishing rod.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.440
You know, you just didn't have a fishing rod.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.400
You know, you'd have to make up a bit of a hand line.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.760
Can you explain to me what a hand line is?

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.840
Hand line, well, just a piece of,

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.160
you know, you'd have a stick, basically,

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.040
and you'd wind line, any line you could find, basically,

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:24.720
and a bit of monofilament tied to the end of it.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:29.000
And even that, you didn't, you know,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.480
we didn't go to tackle shops or anything.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.080
We just collected stuff that other people lost

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.560
off the foreshore and tied it to the end of a line.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.400
And then you'd dig some garden worms at the back

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.560
of the grandparents' house,

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.720
and you'd be using garden worms for baits, sort of thing,

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.880
or kipper for cong reels out there.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.280
So if you were growing up here,

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.440
this is part of your childhood,

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.160
going out there fishing and swimming.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.000
I mean, that was it.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.280
I mean, our childhood was, you know,

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.840
when you think about it, pretty tough, I suppose,

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.760
but it was, you know, we had the estuary to play in.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.680
I mean, we'd swim in there endlessly.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.680
We'd swim from the several dock to Black Rock,

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.800
back at Tye Tide, sort of, you know,

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:15.400
with the last of the flood, we'd get it diving off the dock,

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.240
swim to Black Rock,

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.080
and then go back with the first of the ebb.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:18.920
And...

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.480
Did anyone get into trouble?

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.200
Never, nobody.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.400
In my time, I never heard of anybody drowning.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.520
I mean, we had a few close calls.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:32.240
I can remember a boy, I won't mention his name,

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.080
but...

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.960
We were all swimming in the dock,

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.200
with the water from the seven tunnel pumping station

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.680
is pumped out.

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.800
We've got a good swimming area in there,

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.760
pretty cold, the spring water,

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.520
but it was high tide,

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.840
and somebody pushed the one boy in,

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.320
and he couldn't swim.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:58.160
So, you know, which they thought was great fun, like.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.200
So he's flapping around in the water,

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.120
floating, quite sort of big lump of a boy,

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.560
you know, one of the bigger boys, like.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.120
And he's there in the water flapping around,

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.920
and all of a sudden he said, I can't swim,

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.280
and he just went straight down, gone.

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.520
And there's no tide in there as such,

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:17.680
but it's pretty deep water.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.440
So of course, two or three of the other boys

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.160
dived in to catch hold of him and pull him out.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.040
And he was so big and strong,

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.640
he was just fighting everybody off.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.040
Yeah, well that's a scary bit, isn't it?

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.600
And then he goes straight back down again,

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.080
straight back, and he didn't want until he was full of,

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.200
you know, full of water, and sort of quietened down a bit,

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.520
that they were able to sort of drag him out.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.120
Oh my God.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.000
But that was just part and parcel of the day.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.600
I mean, it was, you know, fishing,

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.600
and sort of, as they say, collecting bait,

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.600
collecting, you know, looking for fishing tackle,

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.440
running around the rocks.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.760
And it had been for your parents and your grandparents too,

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:53.600
you know, generations.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.560
Yes, oh yeah, I mean,

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.520
yeah, they've all sort of grown up there,

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.720
and sort of, you know,

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.360
it was a pretty idyllic life when you look back at it,

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.120
as far as, you know, you didn't have to,

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.160
nobody was watching you, you just got on with it,

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.320
and sort of, you didn't, when you went swimming,

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.400
you didn't have a towel, you'd dry your jumper,

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.920
and sort of, you know, that would,

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:14.800
think nothing of it.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.600
You know, today, your parents would be horrified

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.560
what we were doing.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.880
They're perhaps overly protective, I don't know,

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.040
but we were just, as long as you come back

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.880
at the end of the day, it was no problem.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.320
You'd have a mobile phone to check, you know, it was strange.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.400
Oh, God, I know.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:34.440
But, yeah, it was a different world, a different life.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:39.440
But, for me, it planted the seed of fishing,

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.960
being taken out there when I was a young boy, come back.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.480
When I got back, my eel had gone through a hole

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.800
in the corner of the Essie and Sack,

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.520
but we had a few flatfish,

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.200
and my grandmother would cook them up with chips

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.240
in blooming, a great big, I can't remember it now,

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.680
a great big chip pan full of white fat.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.520
Whatever it was.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.360
Every house had one of those.

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.280
Yeah, so, but she'd cook lovely, beautiful chips,

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.680
and she'd fry the flounder up for me,

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.560
and that's what we used to do.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.440
So, we went out then, anyway, time went on.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.120
Eventually, I'd sneak out there on my own,

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.200
if I could find that old net and be out there

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.120
with the boys, two or three of us.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.160
One of the fishermen now, Paul Watkins,

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.760
he would grow up with me, a year or so older than me,

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.080
but he'd come out there, two or three of the other boys.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.720
We'd sneak out there, and we'd be up to all sorts.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:35.240
We'd find any net we could, and sort of peg it out there,

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.120
and fish with the lathe net, fish with the rods.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.960
Turn over rocks looking reels.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.600
Just endless sort of fun.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:51.600
Then, of course, you'd have all the life in there,

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.000
and you'd wind up until about 14,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.280
and then other things kick in,

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.760
and you sort of drifted away from it.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.760
And then, exams, school.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.560
Women.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.920
Women, yeah, all that sort of thing.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.240
And then, well, before you knew it, apprentice,

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.360
and then before you got married quite young,

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:16.240
and sort of house, mortgage quite young.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.920
And then, I spent the next 20 years,

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.440
until I was about in my late 40s, sorry, 30s,

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.240
working seven days a week.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:30.720
So, it was, you know, all of a sudden,

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.000
any thoughts of fishing, really,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.320
even the odd rod fishing trip, you know, were gone.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.840
I had other things on my mind, other sort of things.

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.400
And fishing was forgotten, really.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.360
It was time moved on.

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:48.320
And then, in the mid-90s, 1990s, mid to late 1990s,

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.400
we had a phone call from the secretary of the association.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:57.440
They didn't call it,

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.240
they may have still called it a syndicate then.

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.880
Dick Obede, he was the secretary then.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.680
He was based in the shipyard at Sobrook.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.080
And he phoned up and he said,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.320
would you like to have a license?

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:22.920
And a late night fishing license?

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.480
And you and your brother?

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:28.120
And I said, yeah, of course we would.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.160
I don't know where they got our names from,

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.320
but at the time, one of the old fishermen,

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.960
Ron Williams and Doug Brown,

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:40.200
who we vaguely sort of would bump into a new ex-fisherman,

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.000
it was their licenses, basically.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.840
Because what would happen is that these fishermen

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.640
would stop fishing,

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.760
but they would not give up their license.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.080
They called it dead man's shoes, locally,

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.200
because, dead man's shoes,

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.720
because the license would only sort of turn up

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.080
when they were dead.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.800
And that's one of the reasons

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.400
why the fishery was sort of dying.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.640
The sort of numbers were dwindling.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:17.080
So we had the call off deck, Richard Obede,

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.640
and we said yes.

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:23.760
And he said, well, what do we do?

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.040
We'll just turn up down Black Rock in the fishing season.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.000
It was basically it.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.480
So we were rushing around.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.760
Now we had an idea of how to make a net,

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:38.760
and so we cobbled together the net the best we could.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.960
But then Richard Obede,

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.680
he knew of your family's connections.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.760
Yes, yeah, yeah.

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:45.960
They were all several people,

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.760
and sort of they would have known it.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.520
They weren't, sort of,

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:55.720
they were a quite close-knit bunch, really, all of them.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.240
But they would have heard our names,

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.720
knew we were interested in fishing,

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.920
and so on and so forth,

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:06.040
and obviously known the family.

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:11.040
But it was fate, I think, all of it.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.000
Fate that I was taken in when I was a young boy.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.640
Fate that all of a sudden those licenses

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.440
became available when they did.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.040
So we grabbed them with both hands,

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:24.960
and cobbled together a net of sorts,

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:29.960
and turned up one day on a fishing tide in season.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.240
Sent a gay dick our money, our licensed money,

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:38.840
and got our licenses, turned up fishing,

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:43.840
and we knew Denny Lee, who was still fishing, Bob,

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:50.520
and Dick rarely fished, I'd never seen him fish.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.080
But basically when we turned up,

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:58.080
there was just Dennis Lee and Bob Leonard fishing.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.160
It was Peter, Peter may have had a license,

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.480
Bob's brother at the time as well,

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.720
but didn't see too much of him in the early days.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.560
So basically it was me, Richard, my brother,

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.400
and Dennis and Bob fishing.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:18.400
And they quietly introduced us to it,

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.880
and started to show us the ropes, not immediately,

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.920
until they check you out first,

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.200
you know, on your attitude and all the rest of it.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:34.200
But quietly we sort of become, you know,

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.800
members of the team sort of thing.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:41.800
And then, a year or so later,

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.720
you had the first sort of thing.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:50.720
I'd never sort of thought or heard or sort of understood

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.000
or had anything to do with politics,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.920
and especially fishing politics.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.120
And before we knew it, you know,

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:06.560
you had this, the 1999 Salmon Baseline Laws or whatever,

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.080
come about, and that was when 60% of the season

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:13.520
was taken away to protect salmon stocks.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:18.520
And it's funny, you know, when you look back,

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.520
because what are we gonna do?

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.960
We're not having any effect on salmon stocks.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.880
You know, why would they do that to us?

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:31.880
So we basically wrote two sentences to that effect.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.800
And I got the letter at home,

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.600
someone wrote a copy of it, and everybody signed it.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.720
And it's like signatures, just like all over,

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.160
like you're doing school, some of the, you know,

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.880
one diagonal, you know, just all over the sheet of paper,

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.240
just send it off.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.440
And then, you know, of course that didn't do any good.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.600
So that came back.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.720
And anyway, it was a national thing, really.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.360
I mean, they were gonna do it, and they'd done it,

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.520
and perhaps, you know, it needed to be done

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:04.520
to a certain degree, but, you know, there you go.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.720
That was, we'd been in the group five minutes,

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.640
and all of a sudden, 60% of the season had gone.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.560
We used to start in February.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.000
February the 2nd was the start date

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.440
for salmon fishing on the estuary.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:21.440
And then, another year or so passed,

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.440
passes and seven estuary action plan.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.760
That was the next thing.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.920
And the writing was on the wall with that.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:38.320
They basically, all the other salmon fisheries

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.520
had been closed down.

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:42.560
It was just us on the Welsh region of the estuary.

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.160
Where were the others then?

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:48.040
Goldcliff, Butcherank, Undy Butcherank,

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:52.240
Port and Butcherank, the stop boats in Chapstow,

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:55.680
all over like a 30-odd year period, one by one.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.640
St. Nett's, Mathurn, Slime Road,

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.240
that's drifting into England, perhaps.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.640
But all the Butcheranks, you know,

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:07.800
it sort of, you know, bar a few upstream on the Severn,

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:08.640
had been closed.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.760
The Welsh region, there was nothing other than us left.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.000
Had they been closed because of the declining salmon numbers?

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.800
Well, that was the reason in behind it.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.800
You know, bought out, closed down by, you know,

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.880
one by one, chipped away.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.960
There had been a decline in salmon stocks

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:30.880
and the Environment Agency or the Natural Rivers Authority,

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.560
they had a program, really, of closure,

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:34.760
as far as I can see it.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.040
And then there was just us left.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:41.800
And when the Severn Estuary Action Plan,

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.240
the proposed action plan, came out,

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.720
it was obvious to us we were next in line.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:52.720
And Dick, Richard Obday, phoned us up

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:56.280
and said, look, they want to meet us at Subrock Club,

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:59.200
the Subrock Non-Political, not, sorry,

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:02.640
Subrock Non-Political Club in Subrock there.

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.800
So eventually that was arranged.

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:10.800
And I was, what, 39-ish then, 40 perhaps,

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.000
I don't know, full of fight, obviously.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
And my brother, you know, I had my brother with me as well.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.640
There was Dick Obday, I think Pete Leonard,

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:27.640
Dan Lee, and Bob at the meeting.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.800
And two people from the Environment Agency turned up,

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.560
and I think it was some head of enforcement,

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.400
I can't imagine his name,

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:41.400
but another nice enough guy, Mr. Purvis.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:47.400
And they sat down and sat and ran through it all,

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:51.600
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you know, all the spiel.

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.880
And I said to my brother, previous, I said,

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.640
right, you sit right at the back, I said,

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.120
and everything they say, write it down,

00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:01.760
and make sure that they see you writing in ten.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.560
So anyway, there was a nerve in him a little bit.

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:08.880
And anyway, I said, that's fair, I said, fair enough,

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.880
I said, you know, we understand that,

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.600
and what you said, but can we show you this?

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.520
And I brought out a petition that we started

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:19.920
against further restrictions.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.400
Well, if I did, the head of enforcement,

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:25.800
you just hit the ceiling basically, sort of.

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:30.800
And whereas we can close you down anytime we like,

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:37.720
and of course, the red rag to a bull to me.

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:38.560
Can they?

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.120
No, basically, they need to go through,

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:46.920
so do certain things to be able to close us down.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:51.920
But he went off on one, and it was, you know,

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.080
some of those things he said.

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:59.080
But anyway, that sort of showed us really

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:00.720
what they were about.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:05.720
And apparently, they were gonna publish this report

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.320
after, I think it was six weeks or eight weeks.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.920
It took them a year to do it,

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.120
because immediately, we were invited to the Welsh Assembly

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.320
with like a three and a half thousand signature petition.

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.440
We met, Kamie Jones was the Minister

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.000
for Rural Affairs at the time,

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:26.760
Rodri Morgan, just when the national,

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.800
the Welsh Assembly was formed.

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:32.440
And we all went there with all our little placards,

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.400
a few little posters and things.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.840
It was quite pathetic, really.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:40.600
I mean, a couple of things stuck to cardboard things.

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:45.080
But they welcomed us, and Kamie Jones, he said to me,

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.960
he said, look, we were chatting,

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.760
and he said, look, they gotta come through me.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:54.040
I said, but, but, but, but, and he said,

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.480
he just looked at me and said,

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.960
they gotta come through me.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.920
So it never happened.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:02.760
It took them over a year to publish a report,

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.560
and we were okay at the end of the day.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.760
Get ready to go fishing again already, look.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.000
Ah, yeah, everybody.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.680
Well, obviously, it's been like May, June already.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.320
Yeah, not bad, is it?

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.200
I can't believe it, I don't know what's going on.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.840
It's really weird.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.560
Everything's bloody.

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.200
Like, there's some marigolds coming up,

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.280
the rosebushes, bloody, they're flaming.

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.000
Oh, yeah.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:24.820
It's weird.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:25.660
Seasons, isn't it?

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:26.480
It is.

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.320
I mean, it should be foot deep in the snow or whatever.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.920
That might happen yet.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.240
Yeah, we'll have it.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.400
We are worn, don't we?

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.680
Went out fishing, got the ties we left yesterday,

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.360
a long one, then went to the end

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.160
and fished that back in from the lower,

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:45.120
took the lower, and, got one little codling, that was it.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:47.320
Yeah, quiet out there, isn't it?

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.400
It is quiet out there.

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.800
Everybody's been saying that.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.200
There was a match, Newport,

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.000
Newport,

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.880
sea fishing, sea anglers,

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.600
on the South Brooklyn on here.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:01.440
Oh, yeah.

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.640
I'm trying to get the report on it,

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.480
but I can't find the report on it, I think.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.560
I expected it would be online somewhere.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.920
Yeah, yeah, he did send me the site,

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.840
but I went on it, it was not gonna put it up.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:11.680
Yeah.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.400
I thought there were five fish in the tree.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.520
I think one fell out.

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.760
Or somebody whipped it, I don't know.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.040
Mm-hmm.

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.440
Oh, that was far gone, wasn't it?

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.360
Yeah, it was...

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:34.720
Oh, there you go.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.560
Ready, buddy?

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.840
Can we just go back to the very beginning,

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:45.520
your great-grandfather, William Corbyn.

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.440
Tell me about him.

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.040
Yeah, William Corbyn, right.

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.640
He, as I say, grew up in Chapstow, Nester,

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.440
and went off to war.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.480
I mean, he died when I was,

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:01.760
perhaps six, seven, eight, that sort of age.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.960
I could always remember him.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:07.160
My brother can't remember him,

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:10.920
but I can remember him in Cameroon, Subrook, not fishing.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.520
He was too old then.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.200
They had a massive cast iron range in the kitchen,

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.360
in the back room there where they lived.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.480
My great-grandparents lived in one bit,

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.280
and grandparents in the other.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.120
But I can always remember,

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:33.400
I have three or four memories of him, and that's all.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.040
The one is sat in the chair.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.720
Always his chair on the one side of the fire,

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.120
and my great-grandmother on the other side,

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:42.960
on the rocking chair,

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.960
wouldn't have rocking chair on the other side,

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.960
and he was in a big, soft, high-backed chair

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.440
on the other side.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:49.760
I always remember him doing that.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:53.960
I can remember also them walking me down the Cliff Road,

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.440
at the back end of Subrook there by the shipyard,

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:01.800
and I can also remember him making me a whistle.

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:05.520
A wooden whistle?

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:09.480
No, it was made from a big bulb of seaweed.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.800
If you look in seaweed down there,

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.440
you get sort of a bladder rack,

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.400
I'm not sure what it's called,

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.640
but one of the bigger,

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.360
I don't know how he'd done it,

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.760
but I can remember him with a little knife

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:28.640
bringing up a piece of seaweed with a big bulb,

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:31.000
and making some sort of whistle.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
And sat on the Roman camp,

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.720
just at the back of the house there,

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.960
on the point by the Holy Trinity Church,

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:39.800
right on the end there,

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.320
and there's a little depression on the end.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.840
And I was sat there with him, and he made a whistle.

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:49.880
I can also remember him with his tobacco 10,

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.160
mixing two types of tobacco,

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.400
making a roll up, and sat there smoking it.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.160
But apart from that, you know.

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.760
So has he been a fisherman before the war?

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:02.760
He must have been, yeah.

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.600
Yeah.

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.440
Yeah, must have been, must have been.

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:07.200
You know, they say there's a lot of fishermen

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.560
in his family, sort of thing.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.840
He was a Victorian.

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:16.360
I mean, he was, you know, a Victorian, you know, sort of.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:21.160
But as I say, he fished up until he was,

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.160
must have been in his late 70s.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:31.080
And Bob, the fisherman that trained me and Richard,

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.160
fished with my great-grandfather.

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.760
So Bob would have been a young boy then.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:41.760
So Bob, even though my great-grandfather

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.920
didn't pass down all the summer fishing,

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:48.000
Bob did, which again, I think was probably fate.

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.960
Because Bob was the youngest of the fishermen.

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:53.880
What was it, Bob?

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.840
Leonard, Leonard.

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:58.040
That's in beyond the picture, isn't it?

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:00.280
Here.

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.120
Yeah.

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:01.960
That's in over there as well, isn't it?

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:06.960
The Wye Valley Tourist People have come down

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.600
to take a picture of us.

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.280
And that's the picture.

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.280
He was in all the publications.

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.720
Bob turned up there.

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:20.040
He said, Bob, you haven't had a shave.

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:24.240
And he said, what's about your mouth?

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.240
He said, I forgot my bottom teeth.

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:29.240
Oh, that's great.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:30.920
So he looks a little bit...

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:31.760
Oh, that's great.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:32.880
But yeah.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:37.880
But yeah, I mean, Bob showed us everything, really.

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:41.640
But when he fished with my great-grandfather,

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:47.600
I mean, they were pretty close as well.

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:52.600
And the classic tale is, Bob repeated endlessly,

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.600
was that they were down the hole,

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.680
the other side of the bridge fishing,

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.800
my great-grandfather, Bob, and two or three others.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:05.480
And my great-grandfather had a fish in the net.

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.760
He couldn't pick the net up.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:11.640
He was 77 years of age, and it was his 77th birthday.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.480
Luckily, there were men either side of him

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:14.440
to catch all of the reams.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:18.360
They pulled it up, and the fish was 57 pounds in weight.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.560
Monster fishing.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.520
Most fishermen, late net fishermen,

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.360
never seen a fish over 40 pounds.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.200
57 pounds?

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:25.040
57 pounds of net.

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:25.880
Salmon?

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:26.720
Yeah.

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.560
Wow.

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.200
Is that what they call an American trunk?

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.040
God knows.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.040
But it was quite impressive.

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:37.000
But that was taken to a Bob, again, to tell a story.

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:40.880
He took it to a hotel in Chinchon,

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.680
knocked on the back door at night,

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.440
which also sounds a bit dodgy to me.

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:47.360
But it's sort of, and...

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:53.120
Oh, he must have had a sort of contact to sell it.

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:56.600
And the guy, he showed him the fish.

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.440
He said, never seen a fish like it.

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:03.000
And the hotel owner had a party of anglers in there.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.040
He must have, I think he owned a fishing beat, Bob said.

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:09.480
And Bob took it in and rolled it out on the carpet.

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:13.400
And the landlord said, that's just your tag

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.400
for tomorrow, boys.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:16.640
Why?

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:17.640
That's a great story.

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:18.480
Yeah.

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.840
I think Bob may have added a pound or two to it

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:22.680
over the decades.

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:23.920
Oh, I'm the one who does that, don't they?

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:24.760
Yeah.

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:27.000
But that was his thing.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.640
But he'd say that my great-grandfather

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.880
was mad keen for it all the time.

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.840
Bob would say that it would be a stinking night.

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:37.760
It would be tipping down with rain.

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:39.480
The wind wouldn't be quite right.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.440
And Bob lived on the farm.

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.640
He would look down towards the boat.

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.360
It'd be pitch dark at night.

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:52.920
And he would see a dim light on the boat.

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.760
And he'd know then that that was my great-grandfather

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.200
down there, so he'd have to go down there to fish.

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.240
Oh, gosh.

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:02.520
So fishing at night time isn't unknown.

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:04.040
No, they would fish at night.

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.440
They would fish at night.

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:09.120
There was more fish back in the day, years and years ago.

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.240
And there would always be a chance

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:12.560
of a fish swimming into the net.

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.560
Because with a lave net, you're fishing in two ways.

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.160
It is completely different to anything else.

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.440
When I mention white fishing and all the rest of it,

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:25.440
you're out there standing in a traditional spot.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:29.560
And even though the fishery is defined,

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:32.760
there is a line running from Caldecott

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.800
right up to the chutes in the middle,

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:35.880
right up to Black Rock.

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.760
But people think you can just fish anywhere, and you can't.

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:41.040
You can fish only at specific spots.

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:43.920
Is it possible that fishermen

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:45.520
have stood in those spots for hundreds of years?

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.720
Oh, yeah, definitely, definitely.

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:49.760
There's all sorts of things down there,

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:54.760
what we call stanks, which are lines of rocks on edge.

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:57.920
That, you know, air fishermen didn't put them there,

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.640
but they put there long, long before that.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:07.760
But yeah, I mean, there's specific spots

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:11.520
with names already known by the fishermen out there.

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:15.800
You run through them, the Guts, Lighthouse Fier,

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.000
Gruggy, the Marrow.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.600
Then there's the Hole, and then there's the Ground Stand.

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.360
That's the salmon fishing spots.

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.080
But there's also other names out there,

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:31.120
Monkey Tump, there's another one.

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:34.000
But these were names that don't appear on maps,

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.960
and sort of used by the fishermen to describe where they fish.

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:38.800
And the fishermen...

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:39.640
Oh, wow.

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:43.640
So that's just something you all share anecdotally.

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.680
It hasn't been ever logged on a map.

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.760
Again, we, you know, in recent years,

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:49.640
I mean, obviously, we've tried to get the fish in,

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:51.440
sort of, you know, out there, you know,

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.440
and you can see, you know, what we've done.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.160
But years ago, you could talk in a pub,

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.240
and nobody would know what you were talking about.

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.080
Oh, but...

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:03.120
It's a secret language in the way.

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.760
Well, sort of, yeah.

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:07.800
But we, you know, we have typically meat here,

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.040
we've laid that fish in.

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:11.800
It's all about three things.

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:15.080
It's about the size of the tide, height of the tide,

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.400
which we get from a tide table, the Aerosmiths,

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.560
the direction and strength of the wind.

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.000
Okay, you want it as calm as possible,

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.600
and light as possible, the wind.

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.520
But winds in certain directions,

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:29.360
you would select certain fishing spots.

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.360
So, say we had a southeasterly wind,

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.040
five mile an hour, you know, 10 mile an hour,

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.880
you would choose to fish in what we call Gruggy.

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:38.720
Okay.

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:42.000
Because when, what happens, you can either walk,

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.440
we wade out, or we take the boat.

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:48.160
And when you get there, you put the net in front of you,

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:50.880
open the net out, unfold it, put it in front of you,

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.360
put your hand in the net to feel for a fish swimming in.

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:55.120
Years ago, if more fish about,

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:57.720
you'd have more chance of one just actually

00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:59.040
swimming into the net.

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.800
But the second part of it, you're looking,

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:04.120
continuously scanning and looking for a fish.

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:06.920
So does that mean you're reading the surface of the water?

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.960
Yeah, the calmer the better, so the flatter the better.

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:12.720
So you're looking for a ripple,

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.720
the wake, the loom of the fish,

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:15.720
as it swims through the water.

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.840
And this might only happen-

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.200
Wake and the loom?

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.920
We call the wake the loom,

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:20.760
the sort of-

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:21.600
Oh, do you?

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.080
The line going through the water.

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:24.920
Is that unique to you here?

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.040
I don't know, but that's what we say.

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:30.760
We say we're looking for the wake, the loom,

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.840
the mark of fish swimming through the water.

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.800
And that might only last for a few seconds,

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.760
and then you dip down and be gone.

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.600
So if you miss it, you won't see the fish.

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.680
In the summertime, and when we fish now,

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.000
we can only fish from the 1st of June

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.400
to the 31st of August on paper.

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.680
Bob always used to say that the water become warm

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:57.200
and the fish always go slow and quiet.

00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.680
Okay, so they're moving very quiet,

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.000
so you might only get one chance to see them.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.800
If you see the fish, you pick up the net,

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:04.640
he's not gonna come to you,

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:07.360
and then you've gotta try and get around the fish

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:10.400
onto his nose, no good being behind him or on his side.

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:12.960
So you gotta move through the water as quick as you dare.

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.560
And you've gotta know what's under the water to do that.

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:18.200
Because some areas is full of holes and gullies,

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:19.040
others-

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:19.860
He might drop something.

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:20.960
You break your leg.

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:23.600
And there's a particular gully out there now

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:25.360
that never used to be there.

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:27.920
When they built the second seven crossing,

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:30.760
they ran a trench from the crossing

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:34.520
to the red beacon on the lady bench,

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:38.760
which is about two foot deep and about 18 inches wide.

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:40.400
There's a cable running through it

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.240
to take electricity to the beacon.

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.040
They didn't fill it in properly with concrete,

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.960
and it's right behind what we call the pillars,

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:53.240
two little rocks where we fish in, Gruggy.

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.600
And with a gully like that,

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.960
you will break your leg if you run through it.

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:02.320
So we try to show all the fishermen,

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:05.120
train them sort of not to do that.

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:07.240
But when they see a fish, what do they do?

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.520
So this might sound like a stupid question, Martin.

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:14.640
Why do you use nets and not a line?

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:17.200
Well, in the seven estuary,

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:23.040
you couldn't fish for salmon with a line.

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:29.360
You know, it wouldn't work.

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:30.560
You know, you can't do it.

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:34.760
I mean, it's completely different to rod and line fishing.

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:39.880
It's quite annoying really that, you know,

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.960
you get all the time with your powers of B,

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:46.640
you get this rod fishing, net fishing thing.

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:48.880
It's all lumped into one.

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:50.920
Well, it's a completely different thing altogether.

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:52.480
You know, completely different thing.

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:56.680
It's okay, you catch fish,

00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:58.760
but it's like comparing a cat and a dog.

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:01.120
It's all got four legs,

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:03.000
but it's a completely different thing.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.520
You know, it's our way of life out there,

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.000
you know, sort of fishing with a laid net.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.720
You know, it's been passed down to me,

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:12.480
and I hope to pass it on to others.

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:16.120
So who taught you how to make nets?

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:19.200
Right, when I came into the fishing in the 90s,

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:23.160
all the nets were not hand knitted, okay?

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:25.840
They still made the frames exactly as we make them

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:29.080
from willow, ash and pine.

00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:30.360
Crop nearby?

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:33.720
Each fisherman would make their own nets,

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:38.720
and perhaps not always the case,

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:40.920
you know, because you get some more proficient

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:42.640
and more sort of keen than others

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.640
and more handy if you like,

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:47.640
but they still made the nets from the,

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:50.000
willow for the reams, pine for the headboard,

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.160
ash for the rock staff.

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:54.320
But what had happened over the years

00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:57.880
is that up until the 1950s, 60s,

00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:01.000
the nets were made from hemp twine, okay?

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.560
And there was one particular guy in sub-rock

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:06.440
that lived next door, 12 Camp Road,

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:11.000
Smacker Williams, that was proficient in knitting nets.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.200
And Bob used to tell us that you could knit a day

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:15.960
and a half.

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:16.800
Really?

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.240
The net is a horseshoe shaped,

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:20.800
but I think it was probably a family effort.

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:23.080
They would hang it up on a bar in the living room

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:26.760
or a rope and knit off that, but a day and a half.

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:29.680
Hemp twine would only last for two seasons,

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.840
so they would be constantly knitting nets.

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:36.840
Of course, come say the 1960s, modern materials come in.

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:40.480
This stuff, polyester nylon.

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:42.320
And,

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:49.480
you know, no doubt Smacker knitted all the nets.

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:52.800
And these things are virtually indestructible.

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:56.440
Okay, so all of a sudden, the nets were not being remade

00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:58.040
and the skills weren't being passed down

00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.000
because they all had nets.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.600
And then five years, 10 years passed.

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:04.520
What happened?

00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:08.840
Nets, eventually they get ripped and all the rest of it.

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:11.480
Lost and one thing and another.

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:13.160
And someone like Smacker Williams,

00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:14.680
would it have been a full-time job?

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.400
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.280
He was,

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:20.920
it was old.

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:22.680
Nobody really made a living out of this fishery

00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:24.040
after the Second World War,

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:25.560
what we would call a living.

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:27.200
It was subsistence.

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.280
They would get a few bob.

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:34.080
You know, there was no living to be made out of it.

00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:37.720
No, for a long time back, really.

00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:39.680
It was just in addition to whatever else,

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:43.440
he'd done their pension or their bubbles and their jobs.

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:45.600
It was quite a sort of life.

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.720
It was just a little bit extra, I think.

00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:49.600
Do you know when your grandfather died then?

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:54.200
So who did his, was it his daughter who,

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.680
so you said it was passed through your mother's line?

00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:57.520
Yeah.

00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:00.320
My grandmother was his daughter.

00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:02.440
And then,

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:07.040
my grandmother had four children,

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:08.880
my mother and four boys.

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:12.640
So did your grandmother have anything to do with this?

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.160
No, nothing at all.

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.640
Even my great-grandmother, you know,

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:18.440
I can't, don't recall her sort of having anything to do

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:19.800
with the fishing, really.

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:22.560
And my mother, no, not really.

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:24.680
You know, it was all really, I mean.

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:26.000
Your grandfather?

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:26.840
He did, yeah.

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:28.360
My grandfather fished a little bit.

00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:31.200
He'd never had a license, but he,

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:34.480
fished for whitefish.

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:38.800
But I don't recall him ever saying he went

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:41.200
sort of salmon fishing, sort of, you know,

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:45.080
not 100% sure about that, sort of, but,

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:47.640
what can I say?

00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:49.840
But it was mainly my uncle sort of,

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:52.800
that sort of, you know, told me about it

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.680
and sort of showed me how to do it, like said before.

00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:55.520
Who's your uncle?

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:57.040
Philip, Philip Harris.

00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:00.080
And then he, you know, not long after he took me to,

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:02.560
He's the one who took you out the first day?

00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:04.280
Yeah, yeah, Philip.

00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:08.880
Not long after that, he emigrated to Australia.

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:12.480
Sort of, 10 pound palms at the time, you know?

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:15.280
Sort of, so a few months.

00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:18.040
So what other exhibitions with your uncle do you remember?

00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:19.600
What sort of things did you do?

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:22.480
He was a young man then.

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:23.880
He was a young man.

00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:26.840
He was a rod and line, he fished with a rod and line,

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:28.920
but he also did fish for whitefish,

00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:31.680
but he never had a salmon license either.

00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:36.480
The oldest brother, son, Uncle John,

00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:40.640
he was taken out by my great-grandfather.

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:42.680
He told me that, fishing.

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:49.120
But, they didn't sort of hit it off.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000
With my great-grandfather,

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.480
everything had to be done right.

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:56.680
There was no, you know, you didn't talk.

00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:59.040
If you were out there, you would not utter a word.

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.080
And, you know, what he would think of some of the boys

00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:04.040
we got with us now on their phones every two minutes

00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:05.240
and all the rest of it, I don't know.

00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:07.400
But, you would not utter a word,

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:09.880
and you would do everything to the book.

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:13.280
With us out there, you follow a set routine,

00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.680
and that's what keeps it sort of safe, you know?

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:18.040
Sort of, but he would, you know,

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:21.280
he was a Victorian type, Bob used to say.

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:22.840
And, he was a boat builder.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:24.840
He was a boat builder?

00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:25.680
Boat builder as well.

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:26.520
Your great-grandfather?

00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:27.960
Yeah, he was shipwright.

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:28.800
Really, where?

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:33.080
I don't know, he was shipwright by trade.

00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:33.920
Really?

00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:37.800
He would say he could put a roof on a house with, by eye.

00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:38.640
Wow, yeah.

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:39.480
Something like that.

00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:43.840
There was a picture of him on the Facebook repairing a boat.

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:44.760
Really?

00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:45.960
It's quite an interesting thing.

00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:48.200
We're at Facebook again saying about that.

00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:54.400
A guy got in contact, Duncan, I can't remember his name now.

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:57.200
But, he said, we may have some pictures of,

00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:00.520
you know, this lot there, this lot, sort of back in the day.

00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:03.000
And he sent us a picture of Grantley,

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.200
which was Bob's father, with a salmon,

00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:08.600
which has got to be 40 pound, stood there.

00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:10.080
We got no pictures of Grantley.

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:16.520
And, he said, how they met was,

00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:22.800
they lived in a pill, not, not, not pill.

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.120
On the other side somewhere anyway.

00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:28.200
Somewhere anyway, of the estuary.

00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:31.760
His family set off, or his, you know,

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:34.080
his grandfather or his great grandfather set off

00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:37.360
on the seven estuary, in the boat, with a couple of others.

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:39.160
And they got into trouble.

00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:42.840
So they eventually come in, Black Rock.

00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:45.080
The home guard arrested them,

00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:48.720
or took them into sort of custody, you know.

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:49.920
Something they were invaded.

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:51.240
Yeah, something like that.

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.720
Anyway, but eventually, anyway,

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:58.760
they sort of met Grantley and his wife at the time,

00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:02.920
who lived just on the cliff edge, just up there.

00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:07.920
And I think, they all then sort of become sort of involved.

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:11.640
Like there's lots of, there's a picture of them all,

00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:13.600
sort of, you know, they become good friends anyway.

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:15.640
So, they came off to the other side of the estuary.

00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:16.520
Like, yeah. Really?

00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:20.640
It was, and the picture on the website is,

00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:23.080
the great grandfather repairing one of their boats, I think.

00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:24.720
Really? So, on the Black Rock face of things?

00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:25.560
Yeah, on the, yeah, yeah.

00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:27.040
Oh, really? I'm gonna look at that.

00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:28.760
Yeah, it's quite interesting.

00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:32.920
But he's there, he's only a little, small, wiry fella, like,

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:34.800
and he should work.

00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:37.280
So, it functioned during the war, though.

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:40.840
So, this was still running, Black Rock.

00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:42.960
Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's second world war.

00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:45.040
Yeah, yeah. Must have been, yeah.

00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:47.720
So, I wonder if it was an important source of food.

00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:49.600
Well.

00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:50.960
Or did most of it go off to London?

00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:53.200
I honestly don't know, really.

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:55.040
I mean, they would have sold it.

00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:56.520
But people never starve down here.

00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:58.240
I mean, my grandfather used to say,

00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:00.760
you'll never starve and you'll never freeze

00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:04.520
because you could go there and catch a fish,

00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:05.560
anything you like.

00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:08.120
And you turn over a stone down there

00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:10.640
and you get a fish, you know, an eel.

00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:14.400
The other thing, regarding keeping warm,

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:16.200
I mean, they used to have a bit of coal,

00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:17.920
but normally it was just wood.

00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:22.960
And just off Subrook, just off the camp there,

00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:26.160
you've got an area called the Wharf.

00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:27.200
It's not like it is today.

00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:28.520
It's all filled in there.

00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:32.120
It's all this green stuff, this mass grass type of stuff

00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:33.720
they've planted years ago,

00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:37.240
has completely changed the foreshore front

00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:39.960
from Magot to Subrook.

00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:42.600
It's not like it was when I was a kid at all.

00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:45.360
And at the Wharf, it was like a bay,

00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:48.400
and you had actually a shell beach there,

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.800
you know, and they used to call it the beach.

00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:52.800
That's where they went to the beach.

00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:53.640
Really?

00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:54.480
Back in the day.

00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:55.320
Yeah.

00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:56.160
It was.

00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.680
You wouldn't go off to, you know, wherever.

00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.520
There would be, you know,

00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:01.960
people with no money would be down on the beach.

00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:03.360
Not even in your time?

00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:04.200
Yeah.

00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.040
You know, when I was a kid,

00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:06.680
there was still sand and shell there.

00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:07.520
Why?

00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:08.360
It caused sand.

00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:09.200
Yeah.

00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:14.040
And you get a lot of wood washed up there.

00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:19.040
And what they used to do is put a stone on the wood.

00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:21.240
Yeah.

00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:26.240
So anybody who, if you've seen a stone on top of a log,

00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:27.720
somebody claimed it.

00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:29.640
Oh my God, really?

00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:30.480
Yeah.

00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:32.240
And I can remember a little cat in the back yard

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:34.400
of my grandparents' house,

00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:35.440
and that's what they would use.

00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:37.800
They would go down with a cat and bring the wood back

00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:38.920
and chop it up.

00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:39.760
Amazing.

00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:40.600
Yeah.

00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:43.520
So tell me about Bob Leonard.

00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:45.600
Is he a chap who passed away last year?

00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:49.360
Yeah, he passed away this time last year, January, February.

00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:53.480
And the nicest bloke you could wish to meet.

00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:57.920
And he grew up, his dad was Grantley Leonard.

00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:01.200
He was one of several children.

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.520
And Grantley, his father was a fisherman.

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:08.040
A lot of the fishermen in the group,

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.720
they were all related.

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.640
Cousins, Dougie, Jim Foster.

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:17.080
There was like a little hamlet down here.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:17.920
Okay?

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.360
His dad was like a butcher.

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.880
And they butchered cows down here,

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.440
sheep and all sorts down here,

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.800
McCollum and all sorts.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:32.880
And Bob, I'm not sure if he was one of the youngest,

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:37.880
but he was brought into the fishing

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.040
when he was a young man.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:44.040
He worked in the brewery.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:47.360
He finished up in the brewery anyway.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.600
He'd done loads of different jobs, Bob.

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:53.720
But he was basically the one who taught us how to fish.

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:57.280
As I say, when we joined the fishing,

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:01.400
he took us under a wing and we had a little boat.

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.680
And they weren't at that time,

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.640
they were struggling to get it into the water

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:08.640
because it's quite laborious trying to get that boat

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.520
down from the foreshore,

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:13.120
down onto a mooring, what we call the bay,

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.960
onto a chain mooring.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:19.000
And they were basically just fishing in the gut,

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.960
just off Black Rock Bayer.

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:22.520
They weren't able to go sort of offshore.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:27.520
So Bob was glad in a way that we served a purpose really,

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.400
I suppose.

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.240
Two young lads.

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.600
Two young boys come in.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:35.600
And over the years, we sort of got closer and closer,

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:38.640
you know, sort of Bob, me and Richard.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.080
And basically at one point,

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.160
it was just me, Bob and Richard fishing.

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.200
And Bob, I'd say to him,

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.480
it could be quite rough down there.

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:48.280
And he'd say, I'd say, where do you want to go, Bob?

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.280
Down the hole.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:52.320
I'd say, a bit rough, Bob.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.680
No, it's all right.

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:54.600
And off we go.

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:56.040
You'd always want to go down to the hole.

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.160
He said, we'll get a fish down there.

01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:58.000
We'd get a fish down there.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.720
And off we go and sort of down there.

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.360
Was he actually right?

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.480
Well, you know, it was always a chance,

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:05.320
but he loved it.

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:06.960
It was his favorite spot as such.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:07.800
You know, he'd always want to go down there.

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.320
If the wind was right,

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:10.640
because you always got to go with the wind,

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.880
you can't go against the wind.

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:17.880
But he was a sort of,

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.680
he showed us the ways.

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:24.000
When my brother and I come into the fishing,

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.440
the one like it is today, okay,

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.800
is you have to do it for yourself.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.400
You have to make your own.

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.240
No, they would,

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.480
and the youngs just come into the fishing today.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:35.680
We help them sort of, you know,

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.080
we'll help them make a net

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:38.600
and all the rest of them show them the ropes.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.880
But they sort of, you know,

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.080
they would not show you a great deal.

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:45.080
You know, it was just different completely.

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.440
Bob did take us under our wing

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:49.320
and he'd tell us all the old stories

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:52.280
and sort of, you know, show us how to fish,

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:54.360
what to do, what not to do.

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.120
So what sort of things did he show?

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:56.960
Sorry?

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:58.160
What sort of stories did he tell you?

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.040
What sort of things did he show you to do?

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.040
I mean, he told us one story.

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:07.000
He told us the other one was,

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
there's a railway side in Justin Blackrock

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.000
where the queen, the Royal Family used to come in overnight

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:17.920
to stop on their way back to London.

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:21.480
And one day he sat there and he said,

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.360
yeah, me and Doug were walking back from the fishing.

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.280
We had two salmon and who should we bump into?

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.440
It was Prince Philip.

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:32.440
No, he said, don't go back, this must have been the 50s.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:36.640
And he said, oh yeah, he sort of said hello, good morning.

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:40.080
And ended up giving them a salmon.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.720
So that was on the road.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:45.320
Because there was a line of cottages on the side end.

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:46.520
They'd gone there.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:50.680
And with Dougie and a few of the others lived.

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:52.720
They'd all been, and they were walking on

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:53.560
and they bumped into Prince Philip.

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:54.400
That's hilarious.

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:55.480
And he wouldn't lie.

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:58.280
I mean, he sort of, he did.

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:01.200
So I'd often attempted to write to Prince Philip

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.080
to ask if he remembers the event.

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:08.080
But yeah, I mean, he'd tell you about, oh crikey.

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.840
We would, they'd been converted now,

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:13.680
the houses that you drove past.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:18.680
I think it's the first house, the stone house.

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:21.000
And when we first started off,

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.200
that's where we used to keep the nets.

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.520
They'd always kept the nets in there.

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.400
It was just a Bob's band.

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:34.200
We'd done a little exhibition for somebody in there.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:39.120
I'm going back, 15, more than 15 years ago.

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:44.600
And we were in there, setting out all the pictures

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:45.440
and all the rest of it.

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:49.440
And I said to Bob, I said, what's that?

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:54.440
And there was a wooden post with a ring in it

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.320
in the corner of this band.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:04.920
Post was, oh, post with a big steel ring in it.

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:09.080
And he said, oh, that's where we used to draw him in.

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:11.160
I said, what?

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.680
We'd draw him in on that, he said.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.920
You know, as a matter of fact.

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.280
I said, draw what in?

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:20.960
He said, the beast.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:23.800
I said, what?

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.000
And he said, yeah, we put a rope through there.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.800
We'd pull a beast in through the door in the back

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:33.360
and then, boom, hit him over the edge of the sledgehammer.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:34.440
Yeah, I'm not joking.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:37.800
He was a country man.

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.400
And they say his father,

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.920
they used to be a butcher and all the rest of it.

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.400
Even on the door frame of that particular building,

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:51.160
there were two real hooks, if you like.

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.040
And again, there was one missing,

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:55.720
but the one little forged hook.

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.000
I said, well, what's that in, Bob?

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.720
And he said, well, that's where we used to hang up the sheep.

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:03.560
Wow, yeah.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.320
And there'd be blood running down the rubble,

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:06.280
don't you think, you know?

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:07.120
Yeah.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:10.480
So, you know, that's how they done it in those days.

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:14.600
So what sort of cautionary tales did he ever tell you?

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:17.560
Black fog was a big one, I suppose.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:18.400
Black fog.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.240
Yeah, black fog.

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:21.800
He used to tell us,

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.080
beware of the black fog, you know,

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.720
when we started off and all the rest of it.

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:30.400
And, you know, yeah, we'd take all the pinch of salt.

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:38.600
What happens is that you can be out there fishing

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.000
and the fog will descend

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.280
and you just can't see nothing, basically.

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:47.280
And he likened it to somebody just turning off the light.

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:52.440
And I think he was probably talking more so

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:56.280
when it's dark, you know, in the evening, perhaps.

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:58.000
But he would always go on about,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.720
be very careful of the fog, you know,

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:00.920
the fog and all the rest of it.

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:02.720
Take your compass and, you know,

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.600
sort of know what you're doing.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.600
But we would, we'd take it with a pinch of salt.

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:09.440
We'd never seen nothing.

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:12.440
And it sort of just didn't bother us, really.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:15.840
But then my brother one day was out there in Gruggy

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.320
on his own.

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.480
He hadn't been fishing that long,

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:21.480
but he's a river fan I like

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:23.400
and he sort of knows about the estuary.

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:24.680
He spent a lot of time out there.

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:26.480
And he said he was at the,

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:27.960
20 minutes before the end of the fishing,

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:30.080
bloody and calm morning, early morning,

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:34.320
when we were able to fish in the early part of the year.

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:35.880
And he looked to the west,

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:37.840
there was a bank of fog coming in.

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:41.320
And he took the compass bearing,

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.400
picked his net up, gone onto the bank.

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.560
It was there in mid channel.

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:49.600
And it enveloped him within minutes.

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.960
And he couldn't hear the traffic on the bridge.

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:55.240
Couldn't hear the water coming out of the pumping station,

01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.400
seven tunnel pumping station,

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:57.880
where it flows out by the dock.

01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:01.600
Could he just close all the noise out completely.

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:03.880
And he couldn't see his hand in front of his face.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:04.720
It was so thick.

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:05.720
Oh, that's scary.

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:08.240
So he knew he had 20 minutes to get back

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.680
to the last channel, the gut,

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:11.800
before he started filling up behind him.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.600
So he got across a reef called the Lady Bench

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.640
and another little gully,

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.040
onwards then to the gut.

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:23.320
So he was picking his way back as best he could.

01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:25.440
Sort of had his beer in,

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:30.120
sort of knew the terrain differs all the time.

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.800
He got a good understanding of that, watching his feet.

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:34.240
Try not to panic.

01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:37.960
When he got to the guts, the last gully, it had filled in.

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:40.000
And he went through all his tiptoes.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.120
He had no radio, no phone, no life jacket on that there.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.040
So he was very lucky to get back.

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.560
Yeah, very, very lucky.

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:48.960
But yeah, he'd...

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:51.920
Because I'm always amazed

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.880
when you put these photographs up.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:57.560
I'm thinking, because I've only crossed the estuary

01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:58.840
on the bridge, you know.

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:01.400
And it always looks like such a treacherous stretch

01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:02.240
of water to me.

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:03.320
Oh yeah.

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:04.160
It's deadly.

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.000
I mean, it's...

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.520
You get caught in the wrong place at the wrong time

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:10.840
and you're dead.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.240
There's no way you will drown.

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:15.400
But it was...

01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:16.520
It's unforgiving.

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.880
I was out there a couple of times

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:21.160
I nearly came unstuck.

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.760
One was, I used to work in a steelworks,

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.920
non-shifts, and I would do anything

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:31.200
when the tide was right to get out to go fishing.

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:34.120
So I'd be on a night shift and they'd always say to me,

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.440
why do you always take your holidays?

01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.840
Two hours, you're in two hours there.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:41.120
And I would just, you know, it'd be 10 till six at night.

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.720
And I'd be wanting to get out to the Abbas

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:44.280
two in the morning, sort of thing.

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:45.840
And you just knew it.

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:49.400
But anyway, this one morning, I was pretty tired, right?

01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:54.160
And the fishing was at Abbas three in June.

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:56.120
So you're talking about just getting light

01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:58.520
when the fishing starts, which is what these days

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:01.160
is when we, the only time we'll ever fish in the day.

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.640
So I finished work Abbas two,

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.800
drove down to Black Rock, nobody asked down here,

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:09.960
so I'm on my own.

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:13.760
So off I go, it was pretty calm, I'm on a bad tide.

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.400
So I thought I'd go down the oar,

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:18.040
denied the engine, so I had to row down.

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:21.560
And we always used to keep three oars in the boat,

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.360
two for rowing, one for sculling.

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:26.920
So jumped in the boat, took it off the mooring,

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:28.840
rowed out into the stream,

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:31.000
heading down towards the bridge

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:33.280
and then went under the bridge.

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:35.160
Just starting to get light.

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:38.720
Again, in those days, we didn't have life jackets

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:40.280
or nothing really.

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:44.640
And the way to do it,

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:47.240
when the hole is quite a treacherous place,

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:52.240
because what happens, you've got like a deep area

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:55.200
and a shallow area and then another deep area.

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:59.840
And the idea is to anchor on this rocky reef,

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:01.000
we call the hole.

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:05.480
And there's a bar that makes it so,

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:08.880
in theory, you can't go wrong.

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:11.040
With an engine, you'll go past the bar

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:14.040
and then come back up against the ebb and tide, okay?

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.880
It's got, it's impossible to row against the tide,

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:19.600
the tide is so fierce, it might be five or six knots.

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:21.760
So it's just tearing through it.

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:25.320
So what you do is stop well before the bar and the reef

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:28.600
and turn the boat around with the oars,

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.640
whip it around with the oars,

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.280
and then bring the oars in

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:38.840
and go forward to the anchor.

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:40.960
And as the boat goes back down backwards,

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:44.520
you throw the anchor out and hopefully you'll grip

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:46.360
and you'll end up in the right place.

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:50.640
So I row down, I spin the boat around,

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.720
position the boat the best I could,

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:57.720
going backwards down with the tide now to my mark.

01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:01.320
I run, well not run, I try to get forward as quick as I can.

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:04.360
So I mean, I read to get the anchor down

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:07.800
and I get my foot caught in an oar on the way forward

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:09.680
and I go over the side of the boat.

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:12.320
So I'm half in, half out.

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:15.080
The oar flew up in the air and it was gone.

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.720
And I'm hanging there.

01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:19.520
So I let go of the anchor, sort of,

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:21.960
sort of, and it was a nightmare.

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:22.800
And I just-

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.120
Oh, how frightening, were you scared?

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:25.520
It happened so quick.

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:29.760
And I just, I was there, I'm in, I'm out.

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:33.320
Just managed to drag myself back over the boat was tipping,

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:36.240
but I just managed to pull myself back into the boat.

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.280
Nobody would have known how did it go.

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:39.120
So just like that.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:39.960
You were lucky, weren't you?

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:40.800
Yeah, very lucky.

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:41.640
Did you stay or did you come back in?

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:43.480
No, I carried on fishing.

01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:47.760
So it was just, you know, a wake up call, like, you know,

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:51.280
really, and, you know, I hasten to say that these days,

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:53.480
you know, we all got life jackets and all the rest of it.

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:56.040
When I started, none of them wore anything like that.

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:58.240
Most of them couldn't swim.

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:00.000
Not that swimming's gonna do you much good out there,

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.600
but we said, what are we gonna do?

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:02.760
We used to say, well, we can do it.

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.600
The boat goes down all the way, it's a mean going.

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:08.240
They would just say, do this, do that.

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:09.080
You're just gonna drown.

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:10.520
You all got waders on, like, you know,

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:12.160
you just got no chance.

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:14.040
We're pretty safety conscious these days.

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.160
So you're also often posted about

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:19.080
some of the amazing things you find.

01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:22.560
Yeah, I mean, it's, oh gosh.

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:24.640
What have we found over the years?

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:27.040
I mean, you know, somebody asked me that today,

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:32.040
and probably the most, you know,

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.400
the best thing we've found, I suppose,

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:37.440
is the fishing baskets, the ancient fishing baskets

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:40.600
that were found on the fishing grounds.

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:42.640
Now, when they built the second seven croft,

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:45.040
when we were kids, we would go out

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:49.280
and find baskets occasionally, okay?

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:50.120
These fishing baskets.

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.960
You mean like this, putchers you mean?

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.440
No, no, not putchers.

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:56.440
Like this.

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:57.800
Oh really, okay.

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:00.880
Okay, off sub-rock you would find them.

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:03.840
And they would be uncovered one day, gone the next.

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:07.120
Covered back up, I should say, the next.

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:09.760
When we were kids, and never give it a second thought.

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.800
When they built second seven crossings,

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:15.160
they altered the estuary completely.

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:18.640
I mean, you wouldn't believe the changes out there.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.000
What do you mean?

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.720
The foreshore, for a start.

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:26.680
I mean, there were fishing communities in Caldicot Pill.

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:30.360
Not salmon fishing, whitefish fishing communities

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:33.720
that used to walk from Caldicot Pill,

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:37.480
Carver's Town they used to call it,

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:42.480
out to the Luby and the man, and the Bedwins,

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.280
and the lake, beyond that.

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:45.120
Yeah.

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:50.120
You know, there might be dozens of them in there.

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:53.840
Used to fish on a regular basis to submit again subsistence.

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:54.680
Yeah.

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:57.600
And they would walk out, in Caldicot Pill,

01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:01.360
and the mud and shingle would be no deeper than that.

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.480
Okay, ankle deep, thigh deep, not sorry, thigh deep.

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:06.160
Ankle deep, calf deep.

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.880
Easy walk, anybody can do it.

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:11.680
When they built the bridge,

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:14.160
the mud level increased substantially.

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.880
It's now, you'd be up to your thighs,

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:19.280
it's impossible to do it.

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:20.880
Absolutely impossible to do it.

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:24.960
It's changed that much out there.

01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:26.880
It's getting deeper, I think.

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:30.880
And that's in the Caldicot, sort of suburb area.

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:34.800
Again, when I used to walk out when I was a kid,

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:35.640
it was quite easy.

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:39.480
Now, when you get sort of anywhere near the Luby out there,

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:42.920
it is almost impossible.

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:46.280
But that's one big change.

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:50.880
And also, behind the caissons, some of the caissons,

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.680
you've got massive gravel banks built up, loose stone,

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.680
which is off to the floor of the estuary.

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:01.200
But the main one, I'd say, is the depth of the mud

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.680
on the foreshore, quite substantially.

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:07.320
And those, it's impossible to walk out there now from there.

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:12.080
It must be a thrill finding something, though.

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:16.080
Oh, yeah, I mean, finding those baskets,

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:17.720
as I say, when we were kids,

01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:19.800
we used to see them occasionally and thought nothing of it.

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:22.000
And then after the bridge was built,

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.840
certain areas out there started to scour away.

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:26.120
It's constantly changing.

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.920
You've got pools where there were never pools before,

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:30.840
banks where there were never banks before.

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:32.160
And then the one day we were out there,

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:36.680
it was 2006, I think, after a winter storm.

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.520
And we stumbled across not one,

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:43.080
but about two dozen of these baskets.

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.360
Also, hedging, putts.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.880
Hedging, did you say?

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:51.880
Hedging is like a leader that leads into a bigger fish trap.

01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:54.880
You've got those big putts there.

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:57.240
There's a copy of, we found those out there.

01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:59.600
All turned to peat as such, not peat,

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:03.320
but, you know, sort of old, very old.

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.800
Because what happens, the silt is scoured away,

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:08.720
you get down to the blue clay,

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:10.440
and that's where the stuff is, okay?

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:14.440
And we had never seen so many.

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:17.480
And again, we sort of hesitated a little bit,

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.760
so left it, and then before long,

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:22.000
it wasn't getting recovered like it did years ago.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.200
It wouldn't get recovered.

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:24.720
It was just scouring and scouring,

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:26.880
and the rocks would roll across the entry bed

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.120
and smash them up.

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:29.880
So we thought we'd better do something about it.

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:32.760
So we found Caddo and a guy called Rick Turner,

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:36.920
who again, has recently passed away.

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:41.000
So Rick come down, and he had a look,

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.480
and then he got ready and university involved,

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:45.120
and they, Cab and dated.

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:47.360
They took samples, we took them down,

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:52.080
on a terrible, terrible January day,

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:53.720
like it was Halloween Gale,

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:56.040
and they were really sort of impressed

01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.000
with what they were seeing,

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.600
and they were taking Cab and samples of all these baskets.

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.120
And they were, you know, lots like this,

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:04.760
this ear and shape, lots and lots,

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:05.760
but there were others as well,

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:08.680
that were completely different, so older.

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:11.720
And you look at them,

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:14.480
and some of them look like they were made yesterday.

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:15.760
Do you know how old they were?

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:18.080
Yeah, they were Cab dated

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:20.920
till between the 11th and 15th century.

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:22.760
Are you kidding me?

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:24.240
The 11th and 15th century.

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:25.240
Oh, is that exciting?

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:27.080
And Rick Turner did a paper on it,

01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:28.280
if you've researched it.

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:29.120
Really?

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:32.880
For the seven levels research committee,

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:34.280
I think it was at the time.

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:39.920
And he did a paper on that find,

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:44.920
and it was described as significant,

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:46.360
and all the rest of it,

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.080
and it was very impressive anyway.

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:49.640
But he was with Caddo?

01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:50.480
He was with Caddo.

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:51.520
So I might find that there.

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:55.200
Yeah, but the seven levels research committee

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.160
was one of these organizations,

01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:59.320
they had it until round about that time.

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:00.680
So God knows it could have been by then.

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:02.080
Yeah, probably gone now,

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:07.080
but I think he'd done the paper in 2007, perhaps, you know,

01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:11.240
and 18 rings down as well.

01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:14.320
It might have been number 18 publication or something.

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:18.080
I did have a copy of it, but I can't find it.

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:19.680
Wow, how fascinating.

01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:23.480
So that was that.

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:25.600
Do you really are treading in the Foots, Texas?

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:26.440
Yeah.

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:27.280
You're four bears, aren't you?

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:28.600
We feel that when we're out there,

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:31.520
and people are fished out there forever.

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:32.360
I mean,

01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:37.360
you're in the footsteps of your ancestors,

01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:40.760
your forefathers,

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:44.360
and to me, that's a big part of it.

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:45.720
I feel it's a gift really.

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:49.960
And I think all that's happened over the last 20 years

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:52.240
has been fate.

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:55.000
If we hadn't have got the licenses when we did,

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.800
the fishing wouldn't have been here now.

01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:59.200
Without a doubt, it would have gone.

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.280
It'd be gone forever.

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:02.360
And all the skills and knowledge,

01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:04.640
and what arms it didn't do any air,

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:07.360
but it, you know, and we've built this fishery now.

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:12.560
Okay, you know, we've had to agree to restrictions,

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:17.480
severe restrictions really,

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:22.320
but the new fishermen now don't know any different.

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.880
So, and I'm realistic to know

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:26.560
that you ain't gonna get anything back.

01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:27.400
I mean, once it takes everything,

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:29.160
they ain't gonna give it back.

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:31.320
Natural resources as well, so aren't anybody else.

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:33.760
But that said, we're quite happy.

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:35.280
As long as they leave us alone,

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:36.960
and don't give us all the grief,

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:38.240
and then why should they?

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:40.800
You know, we're doing no harm.

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:42.360
Closing us down is not gonna make a bloody

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:44.240
minute difference to salmon stock.

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.880
Neither are the other fisheries

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:47.440
that have been closed down proportionately.

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.160
I mean, they've closed them all down.

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:52.360
The problems lie on the rivers.

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:55.040
So as those salmon take a turn into the rivers,

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:58.960
they're under so much pressure, you wouldn't believe.

01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:01.400
You can't possibly overfish anyway, can you here?

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:03.800
No, it's possible, because you cannot fish

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:06.160
for 99.9% of the time.

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:07.680
And it's, for me, you see, you know,

01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:09.800
when you go down the coast a bit,

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:11.800
the footprint that they find,

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.600
the stone age footprints of women and their child,

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:18.640
and that's celebrated, which is fantastic, fine,

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:21.280
but I can't help, for me, you see,

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:24.560
social historian, you are really treading in the footsteps

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:27.800
of your ancestors in keeping this alive.

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:32.360
Yeah, we are, and it's been recorded on the estuary

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:34.920
in the 17th century, but it must predate that.

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:37.120
Must do. Must do.

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:39.720
But a lot of things are important to me,

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:43.520
but preserving a way of life is important,

01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:47.160
and what they don't realize is if I thought

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:48.800
we were having any effect on salmon stock,

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.480
so I would have stopped a long time ago,

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:51.480
I'd have walked away.

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:55.080
If we had been stringing a net across the mouth of the Y,

01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:56.640
I'd have said, hang on, boys,

01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:58.960
we're gonna sort of stop and think about this,

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:00.640
but it's funny how things have happened.

01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:04.600
I mean, we've sort of, you know, we've got it out there,

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:08.480
you know, people understand what we're trying to do,

01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:09.760
they see what we're trying to do,

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:12.960
there's more to be lost and to be gained

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:16.360
than closing this fishery, you know, that's for sure,

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:20.320
and even, you know, some pretty powerful people

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:22.880
in the rod sort of fishing sort of side of it,

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:24.760
on the Y, for instance, you know,

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:27.240
they're quite sympathetic, you know,

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:30.320
that's the vibe I get off of anyway, what we're doing,

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:33.240
because another thing they can see is that

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:35.040
they're not bailiffs anymore, you know,

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:38.240
and I was reading your book about, with George and everything,

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:40.560
and you know, I met him, you know, two or three times,

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:42.600
you know, down here, again, when we were in the middle

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:44.640
of a war, we were in the emergency,

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:49.320
but are they naive enough to think

01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:52.320
that there are still not poachers on the estuary,

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:54.520
or if stock picked up a little bit,

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:57.360
there wouldn't be more poachers on the estuary,

01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:01.840
I mean, and you've got people looking after the river,

01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:04.160
but part of what our fishing now,

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:06.480
we spend so much time out here, not all of us,

01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:10.160
but three or four of us, that there's always a presence there

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:12.440
and people see it, I mean, that guy that came down here,

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:14.880
just then, he's always down here,

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:19.880
and he's one you've got to watch, like, so it's,

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:23.880
you know, he's all right, you know, but we know.

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.360
You're looking after your patch, aren't you?

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:28.360
We're watching our patch, and that's important,

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:33.360
and I think people with common sense see that as well,

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:37.080
so it's just another thing, you know, if we're not here,

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:40.120
you know, I know that if somebody starts taking nets out there,

01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:42.400
I'm going to know about it, and people around you

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:46.320
that are thinking of doing it, know that I'm around,

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:50.160
or my brother, or two or three of the others are about,

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:52.720
and we still get to hear about it, it's a small town.

01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:54.200
It's a real take-care, really, aren't you,

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:56.280
until you hand it on to the next generation.

01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.280
Exactly, yeah.

01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:59.400
And have you got enough people coming through?

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:00.560
Well, that's another thing.

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:04.240
When we started with, you know, I thought it was finished,

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:07.640
really, I mean, it was just me, and Bob, and Rich,

01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:12.640
and Den was fishing in the Guts, and...

01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:18.920
my uncle, John, I mentioned the family,

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:20.680
who was getting on a bit then,

01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:24.200
he must have been 70, all of a sudden, he took up a licence.

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:27.360
So...

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.720
Is he sitting alive?

01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:30.760
He's sitting, I know he's sitting home at the moment, yeah.

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:35.760
So, but he was the eldest son of my great-grandfather,

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:38.160
you know, his grandfather was William Corbyn,

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.880
so he fished for three or four years,

01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:43.040
so he sort of came into the fishing then,

01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:46.760
and then he sort of packed it in,

01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:48.680
and then Den-el packed it in,

01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:50.720
and it was back to me and Bob again,

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.520
and I thought, oh, tricky.

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:57.920
And then, well, out to the blue, Tim Bevan,

01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:59.440
again, I mentioned his name early on,

01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:03.440
a local boy, whose uncle had fished many years ago,

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:08.360
he took up a licence, and things were sort of being,

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:11.200
you were seeing it on TV, TV companies were getting involved

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:12.640
and coming down to watch the fishing,

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:16.040
and people doing little books and magazines,

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:17.840
and it was, people in the village

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.840
were starting to take notice of the fishing,

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.880
because a lot of them probably never heard of it before,

01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:23.720
poor security has changed, I mean, it's huge

01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:24.920
compared to what it used to be.

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.480
So many incomeers.

01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:27.640
Yeah, lots of incomeers,

01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:29.640
and then they were taking an interest,

01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:33.680
but Tim took up a licence, and then, of course,

01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:36.160
he's in the pub, and he's talking to somebody,

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:38.880
and then a couple of other boys expressed an interest,

01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:41.040
and they took up licences, and before you knew it,

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:44.280
we had seven or eight, the maximum, sort of fishermen,

01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:46.760
and it sort of, a new lease of life,

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:50.680
all of a sudden, when I started, I was the second youngest,

01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:53.040
I'm now the second oldest, so it's, yeah,

01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:53.880
which is quite frightening.

01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:54.720
That's a bit sobering, isn't it?

01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:55.560
It is, very sobering.

01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:56.400
Yeah, it happens to us all.

01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:00.400
Yeah, but it was so great,

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.600
and it's brought a new lease of life to the fishery,

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:05.480
and I really feel this turn in the corner,

01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.480
it certainly has in that respect,

01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:12.200
and you've got boys suggesting Facebook pages,

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:16.120
and you might think I'm cranky and what's that about,

01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:18.000
but that's proved a marvellous thing.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.800
It's, yeah, I share your views on that,

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:25.200
I'm slightly, oh, God, really, it's so much, you know,

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:28.120
self-obsession, but with the River Project,

01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:31.120
it's been a fantastic way of reaching people,

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:32.240
as has your page.

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:34.240
Yeah, I mean, it's really got it out there,

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:36.520
but it's a frightening, it's quite,

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:38.880
they say drugs are addictive and booze is addictive,

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:39.920
but it's an addictive thing.

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:40.760
I know, that's the trouble.

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:42.760
You can be dragged right into it,

01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:44.680
but for the page, it's been a great thing,

01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:47.240
and long may it continue.

01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:52.640
Yeah, I mean, as far as you couldn't be in a better place,

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.440
we could not be in a better place.

01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:56.880
The only fly in the ointment at the moment is that

01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:01.880
we've managed to get our new 10-year lease,

01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:03.120
they did change it about,

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:04.600
and God knows what they put in it,

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:06.200
we didn't really know at the end of the day,

01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:08.480
but we had to sign it to be able to fish,

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:12.600
but the latest big idea of Natural Resources Wales

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:17.160
is total catch and release for all salmon in Wales.

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:18.680
That's the latest thing that's been,

01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:20.280
that was presented, I think, last year

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:23.880
to the Minister for Rural Affairs, Leslie Griffiths,

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:28.120
and she has put it up for a public inquiry.

01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:30.160
So is she in Anglia at all, or are they fishing?

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:31.000
I have no idea what she is.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.640
She's the Minister for Rural Affairs

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:34.320
in the Welsh Assembly.

01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:38.520
So she has now ordered a public inquiry,

01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:41.760
which starts on the 15th of January.

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:45.800
We've questioned whether we're sort of gonna be,

01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:48.800
that restriction would be put on us,

01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:52.320
but you know, right into these people

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:53.960
is like, clean your air out,

01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:57.560
but we have got letters that sort of say that

01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:01.120
at the moment, at this time, and all the rest of it,

01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:06.120
that it won't be, because the why is probably not at risk.

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:08.680
Why in us can he help?

01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:10.360
Why in us, the Foundation?

01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:12.320
They would be well aware of what we're doing.

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:14.640
Yeah, but are they in need of help?

01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:16.000
I met Stephen Marsh Smith,

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.440
I met the guy who took over from him.

01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:21.480
Again, they didn't seem to have any problem

01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:23.480
with what we're doing.

01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:24.600
I don't know.

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:29.280
But it's Natural Resources Wales,

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:30.600
and the people within it.

01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:33.640
Piddi Gough, I mean, he goes back 20 years

01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:35.280
when we first started all this.

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:38.080
He's been there ever since, and I think he's outbent,

01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:41.200
I think he's deluded, I think he's outbent on finishing us.

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:42.760
I haven't looked at all this sort of stuff

01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:44.440
that they're gonna say at this inquiry,

01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:47.080
but all these names keep popping up,

01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:49.720
the people from 20 years ago, Guy Morrill.

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:54.480
If you read the evidence and all the rest of it on it.

01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:56.520
I wonder if you need to press the heritage

01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:58.000
side of the street side a bit.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.680
Yeah. Actually.

01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:01.680
Because that's why I mentioned footprints

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:03.200
down the road there, you know,

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:05.000
they make a big deal of that.

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:07.280
But it makes no difference, Maash,

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:10.480
with the environment agency, Natural Resources Wales,

01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:13.800
that they've got endless letters.

01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:16.240
We push it with them, and they say,

01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:18.960
yeah, you can have your heritage, you know, great.

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.960
You can go out there and fish any time you like.

01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:22.680
But you put the fish back, oh, you can stand there

01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:24.120
with a hole cut in the back of your net

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:26.080
so the fish can swim through it.

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:28.680
And you just think, what planet these people are,

01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:30.040
you just wanna pull your hair out.

01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:33.640
So we learned years ago, I learned straight away,

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:36.760
you know, basically, I went to a meeting back,

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:38.600
oh, Christ, when was it?

01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:42.960
2006, 2005, at the Elam Valley.

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:44.680
Yeah. All sort of naive

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:46.960
and sort of you're gonna make a difference.

01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:50.000
And you walk into this meeting,

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.640
and all of a sudden these people come out to the woodwork,

01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:57.680
and you know, the big guns, like all the rest of it.

01:29:57.680 --> 01:29:59.160
And you're just thinking,

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:01.880
well, you know, all the netsmen resigned anyway,

01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:05.280
they just said, no, we're not having any of this.

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:08.560
You could deal with them, you know, it's just frightening.

01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:10.320
They talk each other's language, you see.

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:12.040
They do, and you just cannot compete.

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:14.040
No, I just thought, I can't compete.

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:15.480
So I thought.

01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:17.960
But I think you're doing the right thing

01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:21.120
by doing this, you know, social media,

01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:24.360
raising a profile, and you have had lots of profile.

01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:26.800
Oh, yeah, it's amazing, incredible.

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:30.200
He's never been off TV in the last 20 years,

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:32.000
and the new name has been on it.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.320
And you know, okay, you know,

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:37.160
I wish I could compete in other ways,

01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:41.080
but you know you can't, so you just do what you can.

01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:43.360
Yeah. And I think right-minded people

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.080
that, you know, sort of support us.

01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:47.080
And we, and locally, I mean,

01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:48.560
you never believe the support we get.

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:52.280
I mean, we used to, when we built this net house,

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:56.600
there's pictures there on the wall, 2006, I think it was.

01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:59.280
We had an open day for the fishery

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:01.120
at the end of the season.

01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:04.280
And it was just family and friends, really.

01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:07.120
So we, you know, 20 people, the rest of it.

01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:10.760
And we happened last year, all these years later,

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:13.960
and there was like 300 more people there.

01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:17.360
So, and the people from Faramoy, the locality,

01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:19.080
and they all sort of support us.

01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:19.920
And it's brilliant.

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:22.880
Part of my remit is to organize a series of events.

01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:25.720
One is to let people know about the wider project,

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:29.040
but it's volunteer recruitment as well.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.120
So would you be willing to come along to one of those

01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:34.040
and pay for your expenses and stuff,

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:35.120
just to talk about what you do,

01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:36.800
maybe bring some of this along?

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:39.320
Because there's lots of new developments going up.

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:44.320
And the question is, do they know about their locality,

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:48.320
their heritage?

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:50.680
And so is that something you might need to do?

01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:54.960
Yeah, I mean, I do stuff every day of the week, actually.

01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:56.280
You don't think I need it?

01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:59.800
No, no, no, no, I don't mind doing it at all.

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:03.680
But unfortunately, I gotta be absolutely,

01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:05.680
a few more blocks.

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:06.520
Yeah, of course, yeah.

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:09.440
You know, I'm not greedy at all, but at all.

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:11.280
So how much would you expect then?

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:12.120
For what?

01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:16.360
You'd be coming along to talk a bit about the fishery.

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:18.840
What, for a day or after?

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:20.360
It would be for just for an hour.

01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:21.200
An hour?

01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:23.360
Yeah, but it wouldn't be just an hour, would it?

01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:25.960
Because you've got to prepare, get your stuff there.

01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:28.280
So half a day.

01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:30.080
Half a day, I don't know.

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:34.480
50 quid plus your expenses, something like that?

01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:36.680
You know, I don't know.

01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:38.080
Well, that's what I do for talks.

01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:39.600
When I do a talk for the river,

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:41.480
I charge 50 quid plus expenses.

01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:45.880
Yeah, when I do a talk, you know, depending on where it is,

01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:48.720
you know, I charge 35, 40 quid plus my expenses.

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:50.320
Like, you know, it's, I don't know.

01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:52.600
No, I think 50 quid's fair enough, isn't it?

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:53.840
I know some people would do 100,

01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:57.560
but I don't know if I can charge 100 yet.

01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:59.880
Well, you know, if I'm out for a day,

01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:02.400
I mean, it's generally somewhere around that.

01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:04.640
But it depends what I'm doing.

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:06.080
I mean, it depends who it is,

01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:08.200
depends, you know, what money they got, you know.

01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:09.040
Yeah.

01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:09.880
You know.

01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:14.040
Fancy a quick question about eels and elvers.

01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:16.840
Did you have people, elver fishing?

01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:20.800
No, it's, elver, there are,

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:23.080
the licenses for elver fishing have been,

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:27.000
I'm not sure whether they've been frozen,

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.200
or whether, you know, you can't get any more licenses.

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:32.480
But there is some elver fishing locally,

01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:34.040
although there was.

01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:37.400
You can't, I'm not 100% sure if it's still happening,

01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:39.560
but certainly a few years ago, no.

01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:42.520
And they fish on the pils.

01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:44.080
Caldicat Pils have seen them fishing,

01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:45.760
Mega Pils have seen them fishing.

01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:50.880
But it's not like it is up the rivers.

01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:54.800
I mean, it would be a small catch.

01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:57.720
It is quite frightening really,

01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:00.440
because I've done a little film actually

01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:02.920
on the pils the other day, just a little,

01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:04.720
when the wind was light, you know, the camera I got,

01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:06.040
if there's any wind blowing,

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:08.200
it's terrible, you can't hear what I'm saying.

01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:11.880
But anyway, when I was a kid,

01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:14.920
it made me think about the pils.

01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:19.240
The Caldicat Castle, right, the Neddon.

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:23.800
When I was a kid, there's a bridge,

01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:27.680
a little road bridge just by the, next to the castle,

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:30.240
and the Neddon brook would run through there,

01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:32.600
all the way down to the 7S Strait.

01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:37.520
It was always crystal clear, okay?

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:41.240
That's the ream, which the elvers,

01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:43.680
talking about elvers, are making their way into.

01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:48.560
The brooks and the reams, you know, bordering the levels,

01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:49.800
or on the levels.

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:53.040
And I would go, when was that?

01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:59.080
That would be the mid 70s, or perhaps early 70s.

01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:01.960
You'd be down there, scouting school under the bridge,

01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:04.960
as such, or whatever, or playing or messing about,

01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:08.080
and you would be able to catch sticklebacks and newts.

01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:13.000
It was crystal clear and full of fish.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.920
And we went down there last year,

01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:22.920
or a few years back, and last year, and it's black.

01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:24.200
Really?

01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:28.080
Black and full of just shit, you know, so rich,

01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:29.760
you know, sort of, I don't know if it's so rich,

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:33.200
but it's just not what it was.

01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:36.120
So these elvers, I think, in lots of places,

01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:38.680
they're coming through from the estuary,

01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:40.840
through the sluice gates, another thing.

01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:43.520
I'm not 100% sure about these sluice gates, either,

01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:44.600
because I'm not quite sure,

01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:45.880
I don't think they used to be there,

01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:47.640
or in the same shape and form.

01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:49.800
You know, where they can actually get through the sea defenses,

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:51.080
through these sluice gates.

01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:55.360
But anyway, when they actually get into some of these reams,

01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:58.120
the reams are filthy, you know, they're not what they used to be.

01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:00.800
So habitat, I think, has been destroyed.

01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:03.440
So when you were a kid, you used to play on the reams, did you?

01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:07.760
Oh yeah, we used to go up to, on the levels,

01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:11.040
the furthest one we used to go to was St. Pierre Pill.

01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:11.880
Yeah.

01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:15.040
And there's a ream, there's reams behind there,

01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:20.040
and it would be full of fish, full of fish,

01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:23.920
tadpoles, a lot of them haven't been drenched out.

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:26.200
That's another thing they do on these reams,

01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:28.560
they're constantly raking them out.

01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:31.840
And I'm not sure in some cases that it is a good idea,

01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:33.680
disturbing sort of nature.

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:35.960
You know, I don't know.

01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:37.560
I don't know if they've got the management

01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:40.280
of these things right, no expert on it at all.

01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:44.160
But I sometimes do wonder that, you know,

01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:47.920
the one example I can state is the one at the Nedenbrook,

01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:52.920
and that is not what it used to be, but a long, long time.

01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:55.680
It's a heavy industry right now.

01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:57.720
No, no, I think it could be housing.

01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:00.840
I think they did do some sort of study in the environment agency

01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:04.720
regarding the pollution that's going into that particular ream.

01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:08.200
And they put it down to bad plumbing on housing,

01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:11.160
the stuff, you know, and gardeners' work.

01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:13.840
But it is just an example of how things have changed

01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:14.840
over the years.

01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:20.280
You used to get all sorts of reams, sort of eels,

01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:23.160
bigger eels, and you don't see that anymore.

01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:24.720
They look dead to me, to be honest.

01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:26.840
I spend a lot of time on the levels.

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:30.600
We cut a willow for the nets on the levels.

01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:31.680
Where?

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:33.560
Oh, just on the calicate levels.

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.360
We've got a pollinated trees.

01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:38.240
The reams have always been made from willow,

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:39.880
cut that in the winter.

01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:41.520
Need a ladder to get up the tree now,

01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:44.920
but you cut it in the winter, struck the bark off.

01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:50.480
So you source everything locally?

01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:54.400
Yeah, everything that's made, the frame of the lathe net is,

01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:57.120
and the main thing is the willow.

01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:58.800
I mean, because you've got the pollinated trees

01:37:58.800 --> 01:37:59.760
down the levels,

01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:04.760
and that sort of curve that comes out the top of the tree

01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:08.280
after about two years,

01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:10.840
that's what you're looking for, that little curve,

01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:12.920
about two inches in diameter.

01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:16.360
You watch the tree grow,

01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:18.920
and then get up there and chop a couple of eels.

01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:22.760
As far as the handle, the rock staff goes,

01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:27.320
it's not on the levels, but behind the levels.

01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:30.160
Slade wood perhaps is a good place.

01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:33.760
You get an ash sapne growing,

01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:38.760
and what happens is that you get this one there.

01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:46.720
Much harder than the other one, honestly.

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:50.360
And you get an ash sapne growing just like that,

01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:51.720
and you have two shoots on it,

01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:55.840
and that one becomes dominant, that one falls off.

01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:59.880
And you see that, and you're looking for that kick

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:05.960
that's produced when that comes away,

01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:09.600
and that's common in ash sapnes,

01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:14.040
and you cut that again in January, February,

01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:17.120
the sap is down, strip the back off straight away,

01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:18.920
and that's your handle,

01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:20.040
and what we call the rock staff,

01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:25.040
because that's the traditional shape.

01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:28.520
Ash is very hard, and the handle of the net

01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:29.680
is not only used for a handle,

01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:34.000
it's used for a walking stick, a feeler,

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.160
as the name rock staff involved.

01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:37.880
Yeah, when you're wading,

01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:40.040
when you're wading, you're sort of out there,

01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:43.200
use this to feel,

01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:45.080
you know roughly what's in the water in front of you,

01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:48.920
but you're sort of feeling for holes and gullies,

01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:49.880
and if you feel a hole in gully,

01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:51.400
you just move to the one side.

01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:56.440
Also, the tie can be running on your body at five or six knots,

01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:00.320
and you've got a job to stand up sometimes,

01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:03.120
and you use this for balance,

01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:06.000
sort of to help yourself stay upright,

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.760
or if you trip, put it down,

01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:11.040
and sort of stop yourself falling on your face.

01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:12.080
That's a terrifying thing.

01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:13.240
As such.

01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:15.600
Well, I'm gonna just check the time,

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:16.800
I'm gonna have to go.

01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:20.480
Is there anything else you'd like to add, Martin?

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:23.640
Any other memories or characters or stuff?

01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:25.200
Oh, I don't know.

01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:26.440
It's probably all coming to you after I've gone.

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:28.320
Yeah, I know it will, yeah.

01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:29.160
Definitely.

01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:33.000
You can always add it when I've done the transcription,

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.080
I'll put it back, and you can add things to it.

01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:38.040
Yeah, yeah, we'll do that.

01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:39.400
But I'd love to come out one day,

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:40.360
would that be possible?

01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:41.920
Yeah, come out and see,

01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:46.040
the trick is to pick a big spring tide,

01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:49.080
on a very calm day, so watch the weather,

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:51.560
and lighter winds are better.

01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:53.000
That means absolutely nothing to me.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.800
Yeah, they'll phone me up then,

01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:55.640
just message me and I'll be good.

01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:57.440
I will never clear what a light wind is.

01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:58.280
No, no.

01:40:58.280 --> 01:40:59.120
You know?

01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:03.560
But yeah, you'd be best off coming out in that situation,

01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:06.760
because you could go out in the boat then,

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:07.600
you could go out mid-channel,

01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:09.080
or even walk out if you wanted to.

01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:09.920
Yeah.

01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:12.680
You could take a cross onto the island and...

01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:13.520
Leave me?

01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:15.800
Oh my God.

01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:16.640
Charge you to come back.

01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:17.880
Oh my goodness.

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:22.040
You're too young to ride with the Aust Ferry then,

01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:22.880
aren't you?

01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:27.880
Yeah, I may have been across as I'm taking the cross on it.

01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:30.400
And are you okay for me to give you a contact

01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:32.360
to Emma Drabble, she's a photographer?

01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:33.320
Yeah.

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:34.160
Is that okay?

01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:35.000
Yeah, it's fine.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.040
I imagine she'd like to take some in here,

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:38.600
and probably out there as well.

01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:40.000
Yeah, no problem, no issue.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.120
Yeah, no problem.

01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:42.960
Thanks, Marzie.

01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:45.400
Can I take a photograph just for the Facebook page?

01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:46.600
Yeah, you can, yeah.

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:48.000
Take one of you as well.

01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:48.880
Oh my God.

01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:49.720
You're so very good.

01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:50.560
You're so good at photography.

01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:53.520
Well, I'll go show you a photograph of it yesterday.

01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:59.760
Still got a toothache, it's horrible.

01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:01.320
Big bloody thing.

01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:08.000
Oh no, it's not on here, it's on here.

01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:11.280
Here.

01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:17.280
What sort of pike is it?

01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:18.800
It's a pike.

01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:20.000
Oh, a fish head.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.120
Well, I went with George and Martin Bower.

01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:22.960
Oh, right, yeah.

01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:23.800
Do you know Martin Bower?

01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:24.640
No, I don't know.

01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:25.840
He writes The Anding Times.

01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:27.040
Oh, right there, when he got.

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:31.000
Yeah, and actually, I didn't really,

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.240
they just, I didn't really do anything,

01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:34.600
I just helped a very little.

01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:35.440
Actually.

01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:38.480
I think I have a picture of you on the net,

01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:40.400
actually, look.

01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:42.720
Should I keep the hat on or off?

01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:43.560
Let me just.

01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:44.400
Do you like it?

01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:48.480
I quite like the light in here.

01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:52.840
I quite like, I quite like the sat in the chair, actually.

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:53.680
Do you, Laura?

01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:56.920
Yeah, because, do you wanna hold the net?

01:42:56.920 --> 01:42:58.680
The knitting, as you can see.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:01.840
I can't wait that, well, I'll show you,

01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:05.840
because the sun's coming through, it'll be lovely.

01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:16.560
Just show you.

01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:19.720
Well, maybe, could you just move that side

01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:22.720
just a slightly bit, because, yeah, just a slightly.

01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:32.600
It's a great shed, you know.

01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:36.120
I'll just take them down.

01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:45.240
That's all right.

01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:46.080
That's all right.

01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:48.600
I can't really see it with my glasses, but yeah.

01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:51.600
Let me just, let me get it here.

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:55.160
I mean, actually, can I have you stand here?

01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:56.000
There.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:56.840
Just.

01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:57.680
Yeah.

01:43:57.680 --> 01:43:59.920
Sorry, I like the, I'm just gonna move my rubbish,

01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:01.920
actually, you know, in a way.

01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:02.760
Back away.

01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:10.480
I'm just gonna move my rubbish, actually,

01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:12.480
you know, in a way.

01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:13.320
Back away.

01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:16.640
Just coming in.

01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:17.720
That's quite nice.

01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:20.240
Oh yeah, that's much better, sorry.

01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:21.400
He's too light.

01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:24.640
I have my photograph taken.

01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:27.040
Oh no, that's better.

01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:30.600
You can see inside your lovely shed there.

01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:34.240
I'm gonna go back to the other room.

01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:45.200
There's one.

01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:46.040
I know, I know.

01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:46.880
Very little.

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.000
Yeah.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.080
Do you want to sign your book?

01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:49.920
Yeah.

01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:54.360
Right.

01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:56.680
You wanna get one for Richard as well?

01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:58.080
Yeah, I've got one in the car.

01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:00.520
Let me go and grab one for you.

01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:03.600
I'll put it on the road pass.

01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:04.920
Do I put it to you, Martin?

01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:05.760
Yeah, you put it wherever you like.

01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:07.680
Is it T-I-N or T-Y?

01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:08.520
Yeah, T-Y.

01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:09.360
T-Y.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.360
I'll put one of you on their page as well.

01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:28.200
I'll get you with a net.

01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:30.400
What about carcass?

01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:34.240
Yeah, were they ever used on the...

01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:36.280
It's two, oh yeah, it would be two.
