00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Oh, the mother, how I'm o'er here.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.500
Oh, the mother, how I'm o'er here.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:44.500
Oh, the mother, how I'm o'er here.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.500
Oh, the father, how I'm o'er here.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.500
Oh, the father, how I'm o'er here.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.500
Oh, the mother, how I'm o'er here.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:15.500
Oh, the mother, how I'm o'er here.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:37.500
наг

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:31.500
O say can you see, by the dawn's early light,

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:40.500
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:48.500
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:58.500
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming,

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:06.500
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:16.500
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:25.500
And the heralds' gleaming o'er the land,

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:34.500
Thee bowed our hearts, our hearts to cry,

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:42.500
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave,

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:51.500
Here our noble flag was still with us.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:13:00.500
Thee our noble flag was still with us.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:11.500
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave,

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:24.500
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave,

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:38.500
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave,

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:45.500
Swim free, and bless thee, touchless thee,

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:52.500
Our metric green, our icon,

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:58.500
We'll grow with care and with complete,

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:11.500
To the land of the free and the home of the brave,

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:20.500
By the will of the brave and the free,

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:28.500
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave,

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:35.500
By the will of the brave and the home of the brave,

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:42.500
Here is the land of the free and the home of the brave,

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:28.500
O say can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:40.500
last gleaming, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:56.500
last gleaming, O say can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's

00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:12.500
last gleaming, O say can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:40.500
last gleaming, O say can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming, O say can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,

00:17:42.500 --> 00:18:02.500
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming, O say can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming, O say can you see, by the dawn's early light,

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:12.480
Holy, our Lord, soundly.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:24.960
Bury me well, for good I have done nothing.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:35.200
Holy, our Lord, soundly.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:40.280
Say, the Lord, soundly,

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:46.780
Holy, the Lord, you are good.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:55.920
Holy, the Lord, you are good.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:08.040
Holy, our Lord, soundly,

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:18.480
Holy, the Lord, you are good.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:23.880
Holy, our Lord, soundly,

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:30.520
For I have done nothing.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:39.800
Holy, our Lord, soundly.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:51.920
Holy, our Lord, soundly,

00:19:51.920 --> 00:20:03.080
Holy, the Lord, you are good.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:08.520
Holy, the Lord, you are good.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:15.040
Holy, the Lord, you are good.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:23.800
Holy, the Lord, you are good.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:36.000
Holy, the Lord, you are good.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:47.560
Holy, the Lord, you are good.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:56.560
I met a singer on the hill,

00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:02.560
He wore a tattered cloak,

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:07.560
His coat was torn,

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:12.560
His shoes were worn,

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:20.560
And weasel and ring is pulled.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:26.560
Fa la la la la la,

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:33.560
Fa la la la la la la.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:39.560
A wrinkle face, a cheery smile,

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:45.560
And a knobby stick at the end,

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:55.560
His eyes were grey and far away,

00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:03.560
And changeful as the sea,

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:09.560
And changeful as the sea.

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:14.560
For I'm a piece of gold,

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:19.560
And hope that he might stay,

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:24.560
Now work is done,

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:29.560
That shock is nil,

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:39.560
And smile and wake is way.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:45.560
Fa la la la la la la,

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:52.560
Fa la la la la la la.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:23:00.560
I watched the singer down the hill,

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:06.560
My eyes went following her home,

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:13.560
I thought I heard a very loud,

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:18.560
And the sound of a very good tune,

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:23.560
Fa la la la la la la la.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:30.560
La la la la la la la.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:40.560
I thought I heard a very loud,

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:46.560
And the sound of a very good tune,

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:52.560
Fa la la la la la la la la.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:58.560
Fa la la la la la la la.

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.560
I know.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.560
We'll be.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.560
All.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.560
Here.

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.560
Who.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.560
I.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.560
I.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.560
I.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.560
I.

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.560
I.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.560
I.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.560
I.

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.560
I.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.560
I.

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.560
I.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.560
Good.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.560
This.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.560
Hello.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:47.560
Excited.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.560
With a.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.560
Siana.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:25.560
We'd await in one of the warm winds, we'd harness a new home.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:37.560
Break and unseat, feed and devout, cry and unseat, don't long call.

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:22.560
Feed and dower, hen and meal, feed and why do two stay late?

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:34.560
Help me write on, howl and weep, weep and hear, long and dying.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:49.560
Why, and why, oh, grace and dwelling, are not three and the wedding song?

00:29:49.560 --> 00:30:04.560
Feed and dweller, old and evil, feed and dower, long and long call.

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:28.560
I try, and we do it anew, oh,

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:45.560
and I never, never knew.

00:30:45.560 --> 00:31:12.560
Heaven, I tear us, we never knew what things, made us a man, let me out, I cry and weep.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:36.560
But I did, and you, I'm not a failure.

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:53.560
I never knew what things, made us a man, let me out, I cry and weep.

00:31:53.560 --> 00:32:05.560
But the car will be broken in eye, I will wander near and through,

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:26.560
call us, save your duty, dear love, and weep, for the good we loved, and I die for.

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:40.560
Amen.
