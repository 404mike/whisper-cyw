Cardiff Carnal Anniversary Project.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.240
Interviewee, Steve Fletcher.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.580
Interviewee, Becky Holmes.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.700
Location, we're in the SWCCA office.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.060
And today's date is the 7th of October, 2015.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.680
Before we start, in earnest, Becky,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.960
would you be kind enough to spell your name in full, please?

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.120
Yeah, of course.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.960
B-E-C-C-I-H-O-L-M-E-S.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.960
Thank you very much.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.720
Becky, when did you first hear of or get involved with Cardiff Carnival?

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.000
So that was back in 2008.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.840
I'd just finished my degree in fine art, feeling a bit lost.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.480
And I knew I wanted to do something in the community arts.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.000
And I think I found SWCCA online.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.840
So I contacted Steve and met up with him and said that I wanted to do some voluntary work for three weeks.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.280
So that was in Butetown Pavilion, I think.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.680
So today, I think about three or four days a week, because I was working part time at the time.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.600
And it was absolutely amazing.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.720
I learned so many things.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.440
It was incredible.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.720
I, to be honest, I wish I could work this full three weeks, but, yeah, it's fantastic.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.720
Such a good community of people and amazing artists.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.280
Just a really big community feel.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.520
And, yeah, amazing.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.720
So there we are down the BYP, as we called it, in Butetown Youth Pavilion.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.320
And it's 2008.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.280
Can you recall any of the costumes that you worked on or anything?

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.200
Yeah, I mean, obviously, sometimes you're working in a production line, aren't you?

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.640
Yeah. And at other times, you're working on big single constructions.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.480
I'd imagine you were obviously you were thrown in a deep end, because that's a great SWCCA tradition.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.840
You know?

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.480
Yeah, can you recall any, is there a costume or something that you recall from that very first camp

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.760
other than just the sheer mayhem of it?

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.760
Yeah, well, I remember like starting off like doing basic jobs,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.400
like spraying up fabric onto foam, things like that.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.280
And then one of the guys actually let me loose on a backpack.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.480
He was a bit nervous about it.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.840
But it's a big honour indeed, isn't it?

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.080
Yeah. Yeah, that was really fun.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.440
But then towards the end, we ended up making our own costumes, who made these

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.080
paper mache toadstools, which we carried.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.720
And we were like little elves, I suppose, sat on toadstools when we sat down.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.320
So we sat down, looked like we were sat on a toadstool and we had a paper mache one.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.240
So we actually wore those in the parade.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.960
There was me, Loren and Hannah. We were all volunteering.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.640
And it was, yeah, I didn't know I was actually going to be in the parade.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.760
It was actually amazing.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.120
So when you first actually volunteered, you obviously knew you were going to be helping

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.760
and doing all these things, but you didn't envisage yourself in costume

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.840
in the final parade back in 2008.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.560
I was really scared, but it was really fun.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.840
Yes. Yes.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.320
I get a bit jealous now seeing people in costumes.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.200
I know exactly how you feel.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.880
People often ask me, why aren't you in costume?

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.960
And the answer is because in the very first one ever in 1990,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.320
I was in costume and got into a major altercation with a policeman

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.680
and couldn't get past first barrier because he hadn't been to any of the briefings.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.600
But I was, in fact, the organiser and he was having that a bit

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.640
and totally destroyed all the plans we'd made with the police.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.200
But I am the organiser.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.280
It's like, so, you know, it was a yellow bib for me from then on, you know,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.600
at least it was quite plain who was taking legal responsibility for it all.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.800
So 2008, we're in the BYP.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.720
Where do we go from there? What's your next step in your carnival journey?

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.600
So I wasn't around then, 2009, not sure what I was doing.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.800
I think I was just doing more volunteering in other places.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.360
And then it was 2010 then, I think you contact me to be on the team,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.240
which was like amazing.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.680
So I just decided to go self employed that year.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.920
And in the arts. So, yeah, I was really excited.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.680
So, yes, 2010, we were still in.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.600
No, I think we were in.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.360
We moved to Channel View, Channel View, the centre in Grangetown.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.840
Yeah, so no natural daylight for you for three weeks.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.480
It was, wasn't it?

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.960
I mean, yeah, since we moved to Fitzhalla, I mean, I said, well, it's natural daylight.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.440
It's quite good for human beings.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.440
Apparently, it's good for plants as well.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.840
So 2010, we're in a big, big

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.960
fluorescent lighted sports hall effectively, isn't it?

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.480
It's two basketball courts or three badminton courts, you know,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.640
all under the same roof.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.560
And speaking of I'm hearing impaired, as you know, I'm deaf in one ear.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.920
But yes, what was it like, you know, so you go in

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.960
and the joy was there in the environment, but but quite hard working conditions or not.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.280
Or you just thought like after a while, you just get a new to it

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.240
and you get stuck in.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.360
I got on with it in the end.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.600
But when you first walk in, it's just really orange.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.960
You have to take the fabric outside, especially like the reds and yellows,

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.640
because you can actually tell what colour they were.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.080
We like to reduce colour vibrancy in our artists.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.560
It makes everything a bit more random.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.280
And when you go out for dinner, then it's just like, wow, really bright out here

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.200
and go back in, back to the orange.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.720
But no, it was quite echoey in there, but a really big

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.800
it was a good space.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.640
We were lucky, I think.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.000
Yes, I think we were able to fence off part of it.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.680
Yeah, and put the costumes up onto the ceiling with ropes.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.880
Yes, yes.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.760
So we do need lots of room, you're quite right.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.160
And flying costumes to get them out of the way.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.920
And then there's something wonderful about it.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.360
The same sort of, I don't know,

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.920
some Victorian about the big lowered, lowered back down again to be worked on.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.080
It's Heath Robinson, isn't it?

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.080
Where's my costume?

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.800
That'll be about 20 foot above your head, mate.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.440
Oh, that's lower down.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.840
So it's rather sweet.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.120
Can you remember what?

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.400
I mean, because now you're very much,

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.360
you know, moved from the volunteer right the way through to being

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.320
carnival artist.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.400
What designs did particularly come to mind from 2010?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.880
I don't think I was in charge of designing then.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.000
Right. Oh, right.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.800
I was I remember making a backpack on my own

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.200
and Adrian was like really impressed.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.640
I was really chuffed.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.800
I think I covered like a moon backpack,

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.280
like the help them with a fire costume, I think.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.040
You had a big fire backpack and a section to go with some of those.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.920
But yeah, it just got better and better.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.200
I had more responsibility.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.320
Yes. More trust.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.720
No, absolutely.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.400
I mean, Batman's got his utility belt.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.840
And of course, carnival artists like yourself have got for three weeks

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.360
your your your tool belts.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.600
Yeah, you know, it's there.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.600
You're clad in this thing.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.080
It's got everything hanging off it.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.040
You know, you could I'm sure you could ask for the fibula, right?

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.800
I certainly passed it over.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.920
Couldn't live without it.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.760
Absolutely.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.240
And did that mean because, of course, by this time,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.360
you're a full time artist and tutor and helping everybody

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.480
come together creatively.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.920
Were you able to be in a costume in 2010 or not?

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.800
So were you running the line?

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.840
Yeah, running the line.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.840
I had a head dress I'd made like last minute at home.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.320
Yeah.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.160
Isn't that strange phenomena that you can actually facilitate

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.520
hundreds of people and then suddenly realize the night before.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.080
Well, what am I going to look like?

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.400
Hang on. Yes, I've got to be a work mode.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.800
And yes, you know, you said you're running the line.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.600
You're responsible for a whole numbers of sections and seeing

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.040
what that they're happy, that they look good.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.000
The costumes are optimal.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.520
That whole process of getting ready on the day,

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.360
I have to say, is one of my favorite parts of the whole project,

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.080
because it's it's not chaotically organized,

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.440
but it is organized chaos.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.800
There's a yeah, the clock is ticking.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.120
What's it what's it like from your side of the fence?

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.920
I'm you know, I just think you're like, yeah, I have the blister

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.200
and that the roads got closed and the rest of it.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.920
And yeah, every time you dip back into there, there's a

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.960
I don't know, there's a rising tide of panic

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.160
plus joy as it feels.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.600
Yeah, well, sorry, I don't put words in your mouth.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.440
I'm happy. And it's like the calm before the storm.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.120
You just like, oh, it's quite calm.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.160
Like little boxes out.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.840
Yeah, we've got everything sorted and then people start arriving.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.960
Yes, they pull them into their costumes.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.000
And then just I remember that year I did face painting and it was

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.640
it was pretty stressful.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.280
I remember we had to still face painting and you were like, come on,

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.400
we've got a liner.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.840
So we had to like put them all away.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.800
But people like really want their face painted.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.520
So they kind of do it quickly, make it look good.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.840
But no, it's such a buzz.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.520
Everyone's just looking really proud and really happy.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.720
The only thing I can say in my defense is one of the many, many things.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.000
So it's organizational rather than creative.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.680
But, you know, not merely kind of carnival, but hundreds of parades

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.640
over the year, many lantern parades, et cetera.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.880
Not on one instance has Swicker and the community not been ready

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.440
to start its parade exactly on the time of greed and public size.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.400
And that's that, you know, and believe me, and that isn't the case

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.840
for a lot of community events.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.440
They don't have a list described and the rest of it.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.400
But when you're closing bones and it seemed to me and we took that with us.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.920
It's like if we agree to that,

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.000
we agree to that and that's how it's going to happen.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.560
And I think that, yeah.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.040
So sorry for those who have been away in the face space.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.560
I can actually. It has to be done.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.200
It has to be done. No, no, no.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.640
Yeah. Believe me.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.440
It was my first year.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.280
So you just think you've got all the time in the world.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:25.000
And then, oh, no, that last hour disappears into it.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.920
I mean, you know, you must have a million questions asked of you.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.320
Whereas, of course, most people ask me questions.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.120
I'll just go and say, go and see Becky.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.920
Go see Amy or whatever.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.240
Yeah. Do I have to go out and take me?

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.400
I mean, sorry. It's not.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.720
Yeah. Not so much as a pair of scissors.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.480
You know.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.240
But I know some lovely people who have.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.080
Yeah. Absolutely.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.760
So after 2010, where do we go next?

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:55.440
So 2011, so that was still at the BYP, I think.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.520
At Channel View. Channel View.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.040
So yeah, yeah.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.040
Still in the orange room.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.320
Yeah. Still amazing.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.200
And I suppose more responsibility.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.720
I think I got given quite a few groups who came in,

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.640
like youth groups and stuff to work with, which is really rewarded and fun.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.840
Did you work with groups with special needs?

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.800
Because, I mean, we've always tried to be inclusive and some groups are integrated.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.640
Others are just private individuals and their friends.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.720
There's quite a few individuals.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.800
I'm not sure if I'm meant to mention names, so I won't.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.240
But yeah, coming in, I'd end up working with them one on one.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.960
I got on really well with them and they come back every year and work together.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:32.520
Yes.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.240
And work with a lot of bigger groups as the years have gone on.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.280
I've I really enjoy working with them.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.480
Really nice people.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.400
And they get so much out of it.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.160
It's incredible. Yeah.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.000
It's got to be good.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.800
Creation. So, you know, I mean,

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.480
we'll come to you and I promise to ask about your own business

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.520
and your other practice, because of course, carnal was very much a seasonal thing.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.880
But with your design, I've had on

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.240
your favourites, the ones of which you're most proud over the entire period.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.800
What ones I've made?

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.640
You know, yes.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.800
Yeah, you think that's Becky O'Hanlon's product.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.120
Well, I think so.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.880
You don't copyright it. I don't mind.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.000
Oh, probably the rainbow section, because I'm known as the Rainbow Girl.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.560
So I made my first backpack from scrap stage and showed me how to make the frame

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.440
and wrap it, make all the struts for it.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.160
And yeah, it turned out kind of how I wanted it to.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.720
And yeah, it was amazing.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.640
Yeah, I felt really proud of that because from just making a little head

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.280
dress out of plastic to that, it was quite impressive.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.760
Yeah, I learned a lot of new skills.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.560
Yeah. Yeah, I think probably the rainbow section.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.320
So that would be. And the fact that it worked on parade, because I mean, so,

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.360
you know, very easy to make a backpack.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.480
There was only one really proofing the pudding, which is

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.640
how does the person wearing it and what does it look like two hours later

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.920
after it set off? Yeah, it was fine.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.360
And it was it was totally, whoo.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.600
Yeah. Beyond fit for purpose.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.400
It was like, tick that box.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.560
I think that's the trend.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.080
Yeah. One of the years we had torrential rain as well.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.280
So yeah, I lost it. So yeah, yeah.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.400
You know, yes.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.400
Torrential rain.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.960
Oh, yes.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.080
The two are often great.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.680
You mentioned setting up your own business the rest of it.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.320
Would you care to tell us a little bit?

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.120
About that, I mean, yeah, of course.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.520
So that began 2010.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.360
So I've been doing this for five and a half years now.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.880
And they said it would never last.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.320
Yeah, I still go in strong.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.360
It's just about surviving.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.960
So I teach some art workshops in schools.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.120
But their funding is gets worse and worse every year.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.960
But I always seem to manage and struggle through it.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.920
So art workshops in schools, different community projects

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.280
with adults with learning difficulties,

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.480
a swicker, of course.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:03.400
And then about two years ago, I'm like when it gets quite quiet

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.400
with my workshops and things, I thought, like, what am I going to do in my time?

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.840
I really like if I'm just sat at home, I can't do that.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.360
So I like to be creative.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.720
So I learned about two years ago, I learned to crochet,

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.880
which has become very.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.680
Yeah, you know, you're ahead of the curve.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.160
Yeah. You know, so alongside this, I've got my business called In Rainbow.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.680
So make a lot of crochet things and sell things that there's got my online shop.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.720
So that kind of keeps me going while the work kind of dries out.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.920
So, yeah.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.000
And I'm thinking I just see something recently on Facebook.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.240
It's the the crocheted

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.000
taxidermy heads.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.120
Taxidermy heads.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.640
I'm sorry. That's so clever.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.680
They're very witty, very witty.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.080
Let me mind the the burgeoning market called again, you can't Facebook in

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.920
mail crocheted clothes.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.440
I'm sure you see those pictures.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.120
I'm not sure I'll be joining in that.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.840
But yeah, yeah, not a look.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.640
I'm going to be selling you unfortunately.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.960
Sadly, of course,

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.680
Swickr Carnival heard the news from our soul

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.680
and remaining fund of the Arts Council of Wales

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.720
about almost two weeks ago now,

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:24.320
and they've withdrawn future revenue funding from Swickr,

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.800
which means that the company is set to close in the non too distant future.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.800
This, of course, in turn means that

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.560
that the kind of carnival that you worked on this summer

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.040
will be the last for the foreseeable future.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:43.160
I know you're sad.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.080
I know we're all very sad.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.640
What's your what are your thoughts on?

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.560
I mean, what has that's been?

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.080
Yeah, this summer.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.040
Let's start there.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.240
You know, this summer's carnival.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.320
For my part, I'm more than happy to actually go on record

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:02.440
and say that the the the atmosphere,

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:08.120
the attention to detail, the the the care and love between artists

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:12.880
and the community and the resulting work that comes out of all that.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:14.800
Yeah, why not?

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.040
I'm going to use the word love and soul and joy.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.720
These are quite hard things to measure if you're out there

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.160
in the world of bean counting, but was of the highest possible order.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.680
Yeah, it just seemed to me

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.000
a shining example of what happens when you,

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.840
you know, very dangerously throw your doors open and say to anybody

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:42.720
and everybody who wants to come to the door that you can fit in

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.400
and we can all get on together.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.600
And the glue that's going to hold us together is is making things.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.440
It's being creative.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.600
You know, yes, I still associate the carnival count

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:57.520
with the smell of burning flesh, but that's glue gunning for you.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.760
That was a joke. Thank you.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:05.000
So from my perspective, I really feel and this is down to

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.880
the artists, you know, who were so much more than artists.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.960
I mean, facilitators, artists, tutors.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.080
None of those words have ever really animatars, another one

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.920
has ever really done justice to people who actually deliver

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.360
swickers vision and, you know, who have to hold it close to,

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.880
you know, long hours and the rest of it.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.040
Either way, so the carnival camp this summer was, in my opinion,

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.240
you know, of the highest order.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:36.040
And perhaps gets my medal of honour, which is it was

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.120
the happiest and most fruitful carnival camp, I think,

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.240
in 26 years of carnival.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.000
So hang bang the gong for you and the team.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.680
Yeah. What can you remember from this summer's

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.800
kind of carnival, carnival number 26 2015?

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.960
How was it for you?

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.240
Yeah, amazing again.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.520
We were in Fitz Allen Primary School, no high school,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.320
working in an amazing space, amazing team.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:09.400
Yeah, again, the same groups coming back every year and new groups.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.080
And participating in the carnival.

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:16.080
Just everyone was really enthusiastic, really nice atmosphere in the camp.

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.440
It wasn't. Yeah, really nice.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.880
And lots of lovely designs as well.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.640
People have drawn themselves on the team as well.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.280
Yes, it's a mixture, isn't it?

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.200
There's lots of different points of entry, you know,

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.080
if somebody doesn't have an idea, you've generated ideas

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.360
of sections that they can come to and by coming to it, they fill them out.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.320
I mean, literally, you know, you work with them.

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.920
And it wasn't enough space that we had to make.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:39.760
No.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:43.040
So yeah, space for everyone, which is always a great thing.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.400
Yes, absolutely, absolutely.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.720
And we had a sunny day on

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.960
which is which is great.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.760
Well, yes, again, I'm elsewhere on the day,

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.120
so I don't get to enjoy the build up quite as much as I used to,

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.080
because now we've got our community stage

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.920
in the haze, putting on, gosh, I think it was 17 different acts.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.000
So you're at the atrium, the University of South Wales

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.640
at the bottom of Churchill Road.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.680
It's sunny day, nine, ten o'clock.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.400
You've had your croissant?

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.920
Yeah, sitting on the grass, past season.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.920
Sitting on the grass.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.920
It's gone to the carnival.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.520
Yes.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.520
How was that build up?

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.120
I mean, what was it like putting it together on the day?

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.520
What was how was the parade for you?

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.920
Yeah, fantastic.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.920
It was all went to plan.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.960
All went to plan.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.520
The line, because it's in such a small car park,

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.920
it's always quite easy to get everyone in line and stuff.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.360
And it went off on time.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.840
Far as I know, no costumes fell apart, which is good.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.480
That's a baseline, isn't it?

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.240
A really good crowd as well.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:55.600
Loads of people out, taking photos and just lovely comments.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.120
Yeah, it was fantastic.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.120
It was, yeah, yes.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.560
More, yeah, on the one hand, as you say, nothing

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.760
completely trouble free, on the other hand,

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:08.120
exactly what an urban carnival parade should be about.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.120
Yeah. You know.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.600
Yeah. So top marks were all involved, particularly the people who,

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.000
well, just bring out the best in other people.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.720
I mean, that seems to be your job. Yeah.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.800
Yeah. Use the arts to bring the best out in everyone.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.640
And yes, less of an arts organisation, more of a cult.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:32.680
And unfortunately, as I was saying earlier,

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:38.880
the Arts Council of Wales have pulled the financial plug on the company

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.560
and we're set to close.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.440
And with that, certainly the demise of Cardiff Carnival

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.920
is more than imminent.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.560
Terribly sad, obviously.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.920
What are your thoughts at this time?

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.920
Well, it's just really disappointing, to be honest.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.920
Like there's nothing like it in Cardiff and such a big community project.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.720
I just don't know how it can't be funded anymore.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:08.320
I do know, but it's just disgusting, really.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.200
I was something everyone's so passionate about and

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.520
just bring such a good community together for those three weeks.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.320
You just have to be in the camp to see it, really.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.520
Yeah, really sad.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.720
Really sad.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:27.200
I think you're quite right, which is ultimately, I think we both know if

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:32.760
those who, you know, who made those decisions actually knew more about the project

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.800
than I certainly have to have reflected twice.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.120
But, you know, it's very much a participatory art project.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.800
And it's like an iceberg.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.360
I always tell people nine tenths of the work is not what you see on the day.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.400
It's how we get to it.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.160
It's a lead up to it. How we get there.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.640
Look at the interaction between these fabulous carnival artists

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.760
and people of every shape or size, you know, queen class.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.720
So, you know, they're all there.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:02.880
So on a happier and permanent and for posterity, for perpetuity,

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.600
I hereby award you Becky Holmes, the Cardiff Carnival.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.600
You are a hero, non-existent medal,

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.480
which I hope you will wear non-existently

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:19.400
with pride for the duration of your working life and beyond.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.560
Becky Holmes, thank you very much indeed.
