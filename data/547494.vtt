00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.680
Little

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
red in the equilibrium.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000

If you'll stand please and we'll sing it in English.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Everybody.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
O come, all ye faithful,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Joyful and triumphant,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Come and behold Him,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Born the King of angels.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
O come, let us adore Him,
