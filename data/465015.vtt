What's your memories of seeing coverage of the strike on television?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Oh, there was a great deal of impact of that on television, obviously.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I was frankly appalled by the whole policy of the Prime Minister at that time.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And appalled at what I saw of open conflict between the police and the miners.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
My sympathy, I have to say, was with the miners.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Though, obviously, there were incidents that you wouldn't have approved of, but there you go.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And also I was very struck by the contribution that miners' wives made during the strike.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Yes, it still remains a very powerful image of the sort of angry confrontations that there were and actual violence that occurred.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
What was your opinion of the way the miners were portrayed on television?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I think probably on the whole they were badly portrayed.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I wouldn't say that it...

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Well, of course it depends on one's own viewpoint, doesn't it?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I already had sympathy with their situation, so I would be less affected by the way it was portrayed.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
But I felt that on occasion, certainly, yes, they were shown as being the violent ones,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
whereas that was not really necessarily the case at all.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Thank you.
