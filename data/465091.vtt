00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Yeah, again with somewhat mixed feelings, I think.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I didn't know enough about the facts, I suppose, to make a complete judgement.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But it did seem unfair to me that all the pits were being closed down

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
when a lot of them were not worked out.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You know, in that there was more coal there.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And it was always very sad when you see men losing their jobs, you know,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
because, and particularly for some of the Welsh mining areas,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
because that had been the culture and the life for such a long time.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And the whole thing was being destroyed by the pit shutting down.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You know, it was a complete change of life.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Generations had worked the pit,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and it was the tradition that fathers, the sons followed fathers.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And this was just blocked, it was stopped, which I found a very hard thing.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
What was your opinion of the way the miners were portrayed on television?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I don't think it was particularly an honest portrayal.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
No, I think it was a slightly biased one,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
in favour of the government and in favour of the cuts.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I might be wrong, but that's my sort of immediate reaction to it.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I think possibly they were, I don't know, perhaps shown to be,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
perhaps ignorant or just stupid, but they were nothing of the sort.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
They were intelligent, skilful men, whom I have every admiration for,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
having actually been down a coal mine myself as a youngster,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and been quite terrified by the whole experience and the thought of working

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
in conditions like that.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And I think that was a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
very strong thought of working in conditions like that.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I mean, they were terrific men, they were brave and tough,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and the camaraderie between them was something very unusual

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and something very precious, I think.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And this was killed off by the closing of the pits.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Was there anything that you saw in the coverage

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000
that changed your attitude towards the strike or towards strikes in general?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:46.760
The pointlessness of it, because they didn't achieve what they wanted to achieve, because

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:57.400
I had a feeling that all the decisions were a foregone conclusion. To say this, I think

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.720
that's often the case with a lot of official decisions, that they talk about consultations

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.760
but the decision has already been made.
