00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840
They were born in Pakistan and I moved to England in the 1960s and since then been here.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:19.840
My children are born here, I was married in Pakistan, my wife and children are here, they're all grown up.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.320
Coming over to Newport in the 60s, how old were you when you came over?

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:38.000
I was just about 15 when I came over and actually in those days, you know, I wasn't mature enough to know what was going on.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:49.040
Because I was still in school and there was no sort of limit to what age you can go to school.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:59.760
When I came here, I was over the age to go and stay in school. I only spent about 3-4 months in school.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:15.360
And then I tried to get into college but those days there was no sort of evening or any classes where I could join because my English wasn't high enough to join anything.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:23.600
I had to go and work which was very good at that time.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.640
I don't know if it was one of the first jobs that you got when you were here, was it driving a bus?

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:39.520
No, the first job I got was in the timber factory down in Pail. It's a sawmill, I think it's still there.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.800
I worked there for about a year. Then I went to work in the board mill, Mahamasha board mill.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:58.080
And I worked there about 8-9 months. And I went to work in the battery factory.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.480
I worked there for about 3-4 months.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:08.720
And then I worked for about 2 days in the buildings outside of Paz, Calif.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.720
Then I came to work, looked for a job in the buses and I got the job in the buses.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:25.520
And that was the last job I had. And after that I had health problems.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.760
And they retired me in paternity.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.080
In those days I think there was a shortage of workforce in England because of the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.120
world war. And they wanted people to come from, I think, what happened.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:56.080
To my knowledge, I don't know, I might be wrong, because of the independence of India and Pakistan.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:07.520
Few years before they wanted people to come over and help out or carry on their life with the community living here.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.600
So my parents came over and I just came with them.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:21.440
And since then we just settled down here. Now I get my grandchildren growing up here as well.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:30.560
Happy, everybody's happy living here with the community. But things have changed.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.680
Like, you know, you can't say, when I came over there was lots of work.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.320
You could go anywhere and find work. The work is done. Most of the factories in Nepal are gone.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:50.160
And it is, I think, it's a bit difficult for the youngsters to get a job now unless they got a good

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.320
qualification. And then there is just office work, I think. Office work,

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.160
warehouse or shop works left in Nepal now. It's not much industry.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.480
I don't know where the future is going to be.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.600
I don't know where the future is going to be. As you can see around,

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.120
you know, when I came over you could finish one job in the morning and you have another

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.520
job in the afternoon. They will start you up, you know, so you go and look for a job.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.760
They wouldn't say no, come back tomorrow. They said, all right, come and start now.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.080
So, that was the situation then. Very different.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.320
It's very difficult now to get a job. When you first moved into the area,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:47.680
did you live close by to the community house? Yes, the community also did play a big part in

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:55.040
my life because, as I said in the beginning, in that time there was no, I wanted to learn

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.560
and there was no classes I could join. But there was people in the community also used to come

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:09.440
once a week to teach English. There was two teachers from different schools. One of them moved to

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:17.360
Germany after and the one stayed here. They helped us. There was a group of us, the boys,

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.880
who used to come here, play around and meet and learn English as well.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:31.440
And then after that, quite a few people came and helped, you know,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:42.240
learn and just carry on with the things. I guess also when you were working on the buses,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.600
you were meeting people every day and that must have improved your English.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:57.040
That helped as well to learn and speak. But the main point which I learned from is the community

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:06.240
house, which we had a couple of different people at the time coming over. And after the teachers,

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:13.120
they were here for a while. Then somebody else took over. The three girls who were studying as

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:21.280
trainee teachers, they came over. One from Rondawali and I think the other one was from either

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.200
Manchester or Lied. The two or three of them, they were good friends. They came over and they

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:36.880
used to come over every Thursday and Tuesday, twice a week, to teach whoever wanted to learn.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:48.400
Mr. Summers, who was the bishop of the church, he lived next door. His daughter,

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:57.760
and Brian, and Mrs. Jones, who used to run the cafe here. They were very friendly people,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:06.480
very, very friendly and very, very helpful. And we had a good group of people from different

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:13.440
nationalities and different cultures. So we had a good time here.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.400
I can see on the film, there's some really nice footage of you all having a nice

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.120
party and coffee bar and having a dance, like Scottish dancing.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:31.360
It was like a sort of a get together sort of thing. It was quite nice, good day, good times.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:38.480
There was good time, good friendly times. People from all walks of their life.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:48.320
There was not just Pakistani or English. There was people from all other communities.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:08:00.000
There was people from France and Africa. There was others, I just can't remember now.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:08.240
There's quite a lot of people. Everybody was quite happy to get together and help each other.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.640
And do you remember any special evening? Like you say you have Thursday evening.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.200
Was that a thing, Thursday evening in particular?

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:26.160
No, it was just two days. We had Tuesday and Thursday, which was available. The hall was

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:32.800
available. The community was also available. And people just got together and we just talked.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:40.400
We had English classes. We had a play group playing tennis.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.880
Then there was other sort of game table tennis. Another small

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:56.320
food table. And also the game playing. It was to call the Asian club.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:03.360
And then it became the international club. And that's how it carried on.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:09.600
Then Ingrid Wilson who joined us. She did quite a lot. Her husband as well.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:20.160
He was here as well. Mr. Wilson. They both sort of helped to run the community group.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.400
There was other people like we just sort of got on with it.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.120
Ingrid is still very much involved.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.760
She is still very much involved. She still comes. But

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:40.880
I don't have much time now because my wife is quite ill now. And I spend most time

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:48.800
staying home, taking her hair and there. And life is quite busy at home.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.480
Kind of my time.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:59.360
I got my daughter-in-law. My daughters, they are very good. They help out. They do most of the

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:08.560
things. But because my daughter and my son, they are mostly working. And I'm home because I'm

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:17.920
retired quite a while now. And I am retired officially now two years ago as well. So I do

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:23.760
get out and about. But not a lot because my own health is not all that good.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.360
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:34.320
I've been suffering for quite a while now with this anxiety and distressions and back problem.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.880
So thank God I'm able to get around.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.160
Yes.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:48.320
I can get about. But not a lot. I spend the time at home mostly now.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.120
Did you enjoy your work as a bus driver?

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.240
Oh, I love it. If I had a chance to go back.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.040
How many years would you say you were doing that job?

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:11.680
On and off. I was about 10, 15 years altogether because I was working from 70 to 74.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:22.400
74 years. End of 74 I go up, went back home to get married, come back, went to work in

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:29.680
Cardiff for a year. Then I came back to Newport. And after that I became ill and I was unable to

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.800
carry on then.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.480
What did you like most about the job?

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:41.440
Meeting people. Meeting different people. And I go all the time. It was the best point was

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:49.600
meeting people, different people all the time. And very friendly people. Group of people to work

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.560
with as well.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.240
When you look back at your film Home From Home, when was the last time you saw it?

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:07.360
Not long ago. It was shown in Sendmite, Riverside. My family went to see it.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:15.680
And they also have it put on the internet. And my son showed it to me on the internet.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.800
At home we all watched it at home.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:24.640
Did you like to see yourself? Did you think it was a good representation of your life?

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:33.600
It was a very good representation. But as I said I was young and naive those days. Just the things

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:45.040
could have been better if I had known what I was doing. But at the time what we did and what we made

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.320
was quite good. And it's quite helpful.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.640
Yeah it is very interesting always to look at old films to see what people were wearing,

00:12:54.640 --> 00:13:00.480
what the traffic was doing, the shops. It was fascinating. I got the feeling that you were

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.840
lonely. It was a street scene at the end and you're walking off in the distance and the street's

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:11.760
empty. There's no traffic and it's just you walking away. And I thought, oh that looks very

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.260
poignant.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:23.840
Just the scene he wanted to create some reason or other. Because maybe to show I was, I don't know

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:29.200
what he meant with that. At that time I said, like I said, it didn't come to my mind what

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:39.840
we were doing or what it was about. It was just about what the life was in the UK.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:45.440
That's what it was all about. Getting family together and spending time together.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:50.320
And the shop with the street. There's some sort of band, a marching band.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.960
Because that was the lifestyle those days. You could see bands marching and every time.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.880
You don't see them now. It's gone. You don't see them anymore.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:11.360
People used to go to church and every Sunday it's gone. Every Sunday you wake up, you hear the bells

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:18.320
going. You don't hear the bells no more. I think people are just going away from that religion.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:24.240
It's just life is, I don't know, hustle and bustle. Too much.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:32.960
The life is so expensive I think that's why it is. And there's not much work. People are just,

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:43.440
I don't know. It's just I think this life is changed altogether to what it was in the 60s and 70s.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:54.960
Life has become very, people have become more busy in their phones and internet and tablets.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:01.360
See the children, they're mostly busy. They've got their headphones on, the phone going.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:10.080
They're more interested in their iPad or phone instead of

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:18.880
being together. That closeness of families, it sort of seems to be, I don't know,

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:27.760
it seems to be dying away in the family. It's just me or it's happening every day, I don't know.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:33.200
I got that feeling that we are coming to this situation where

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:42.640
people are becoming more selfish and this more problem, world is becoming,

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:49.680
has become more problematic. You see people killing each other. We're in the 70s and after

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:58.960
World War, everybody was trying to make friendship and build up the relationships. And I don't know,

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:05.280
we're going back instead of going forward because

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:12.480
it's every, every day is trouble. Yeah, we live in some very interesting times.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:19.280
The social media is creating more problem because everybody's putting up so much rubbish

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:27.280
into young people's minds. It's too busy, it's too crowded. That's it. Yeah. Everyone seems to be

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:32.480
switched on all the time. There's no escaping it. It feels like you can fill your every waking hour.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:37.840
People don't slow down anymore. No, no. It's everything is like

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:44.320
we have before people used to get together, meet, family used to sit in one room.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:54.080
I remember when my children and myself and my wife in the evening, children came from school,

00:16:54.080 --> 00:17:02.800
I come from work, we all sat down in one room. We had our food together. We sat and watched TV

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:11.040
for a while together. Now it's all different. The children come from school, they take their food

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:19.280
up in their bedrooms, next room, they just don't seem to be that

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:30.080
they're not. The families sort of life, what maybe is a new generation as their way of life,

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:38.080
completely different to ours. Maybe that's what it is, you know. Life, you know. Makes you want to

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:48.800
think, you know, what we was and what it is now in the last 15, 20 years. This is

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.720
completely changed. The things are completely changed.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.280
It's the, I don't know,

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:09.120
you know. There's no that feeling of getting together. Maybe it's me getting old, maybe it's

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:20.320
the old age, you know. I don't know, it could be. It's maybe me. No, yes, it is. Yes, it is.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:26.320
Because I don't know, like I said, that, you know, the people, they were more interested in

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:32.800
religion at that time, not so long ago. People used to come to the church here as well because

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:41.040
they used to have Sunday service and also in the other churches. The people, this day and age,

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:49.440
they can't wait for the religion of the churches, which sort of had a big bond in the people.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.400
Because when you went to church, there was other people there. You met them,

00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:00.720
they listened to the lecture from the vicar or whoever was in charge of the church.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:12.000
And people sort of have some thing to take some thought back home. Now everybody is into internet.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.920
And whatever you see in the internet or social media, that is being fed into the minds of people.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:27.360
People are not interested into the groups or the churches. As everybody might have noticed,

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:35.520
the churches are closed down. Some have been knocked down, some been sold because people

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:44.560
are not interested. So that's what I think is breaking up the, how do you call it,

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:52.480
bond in the people like what we had when we was growing up or when we was in our

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.000
growing up days. It's not the same.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:06.800
It's a shame. It's a shame really. I don't know, maybe youngsters, maybe they have more

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:15.920
activities than what we had. But because it's maybe because I'm most of the time I'm home,

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:24.240
I don't go almost much out and about. That's maybe, I don't know. Maybe that's the problem that I

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:34.000
don't see it was like as a community host. Like you said, it must remain open to the community.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.200
Like there are different groups every day, different

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:45.040
activities going on afternoon and evenings. I don't even know what's going on here now.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:49.440
Because it's been a long time since I come to community house.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:58.480
There's a women's group, there's a men's group that happens today from two till four every

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:05.360
Tuesday. It's quite a nice group. Just a few men that will sit there and they will have chat and

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:11.520
have a cup of tea and play cards. And they seem very friendly. And then there's a coffee group

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:17.760
on a Thursday and then there's a main youth project that happens tonight, but they finished now.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:26.000
There's all kinds of things. I think what the project, the purpose of this project that I'm

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:36.080
involved in, we won Heritage Lottery money over two years. And we won a bid. Originally it was

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:40.640
going to be for repairs to the building, but then the Heritage Lottery looked at the building and

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:46.400
they thought that it didn't, you know, it wasn't significant. If it was that old church building

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:52.160
that used to stand here with the Victorian brick gothic style, if it was that, then maybe they

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:59.440
would have given us money for the renovation of the building. But what captured their attention

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:06.160
most of all was the way that they heard about Cyril Somers and his vision for community

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:12.240
and how he thought about rebuilding the church once they knew that the old building had to be

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:19.360
demolished. And Cyril's idea was looking at the changing area mainly and seeing lots of new people

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:25.280
coming in and he could see the church was taking less and less focus over their lives.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:32.080
And then he thought, which is very unusual at the time, him and his wife and he consulted all the

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:40.160
people that used the building and it seemed to appear that a community centre should be created

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:46.880
that still has a church in it, it still has that function, but it's more about the people and the

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:53.600
people at the heart of the community. So it was unusual to think like that in those days, early 60s

00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:04.400
and it was his vision that enabled this to happen and you can still feel his spirit, I suppose,

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:11.840
in the way that people... He was a very good man, he sort of, because he was the church man and he

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:19.840
knew the importance of the community and he played a big part in running this community,

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:27.200
also the church altogether, him and his daughter, who I haven't seen for ages.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.760
Did you know her? Yeah, she came up here and I talked to her for the project.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:40.960
Valerie Martin. Yeah, same. Yeah, very nice. Very nice person, she was very nice, very sweet person and

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:49.600
Mr. Somer himself was a very nice person. We got on very, very well with each other when he was

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.360
around here, when he became a mayor as well, then he moved away from here.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:02.400
And Dorothy, do you remember Dorothy, his wife? Yes, yes, yes, I remember them both very well

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:10.320
and like I said, they moved away and last time I saw was when he came here and I was working the

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:23.920
bus at the end, they added the special night for him at the hotel in town and I was invited to that,

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:33.920
that's when we met last time and Brian, I see him now and again on the street going past, he's okay.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:41.840
Like I said, there's a lot of people came and gone and it's good memories of them left,

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:51.440
good people and I hope myself like you said, this keeps going but you need people

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:59.200
to run it, you can't just do it with one or two people. Did you, after you were involved with

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:07.040
driving buses and did you have any other sort of involvement with the community in a more,

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:13.680
in a sort of, yeah, like in a community capacity like? Yeah, I've been involved with the mosque,

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:26.160
with our Muslim community but like I couldn't carry on there as well because of my health.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:35.280
I had nothing to do, I couldn't do much work there because I was just like being a part of the

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:46.480
community, you know, because to be with the youngsters and organize things for them,

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:52.160
meetings, attend the meetings and tell them what to do and what, that's what we do now,

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:59.440
it's only four or five of us, the rest is our youngsters and we just sort of

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:10.160
guide them to running a mosque day-to-day business. Even there, we don't see people turning up to

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:18.560
mosque very much, only on certain occasions like Ramadan, Muharram or if there is a special

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:25.200
event, people come otherwise, there's only a few people go to mosque as well. People are

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:36.480
not into the religion in any community now. I think the people are running away from the

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.840
religion and all this

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:47.520
wars going on in Syria, Iran, Iraq and Yemen,

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:56.160
all, what do you call it, there's other, they're fighting each other and

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:02.560
you see young people being killed, children being killed, women running around doing,

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:13.440
it makes me cry when you see all these youngsters and people, what they're doing them for,

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.120
what they're bombing them for, what they're killing each other, I don't know why.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:28.000
In Yemen, this is one of the poorest countries in the world, they got nothing there and yet

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:35.600
they've been bombarded for the last three years, four years maybe, whatever, for what? I don't know,

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:45.520
it's difficult to understand why people are doing this, just killing innocent people

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:52.960
all over the world and the world leaders here,

00:27:52.960 --> 00:28:03.440
they don't know what they're doing. It's a shame, shame, it's not difficult to understand things,

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:14.080
too difficult for us to understand. The world could be better if there was a, like in the beginning,

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:24.720
live and let live sort of business, especially these people, these mental people who go around

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:33.200
killing other people, suicide bombers, I mean there's no religion gives you the teaching of

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:39.040
that to go and kill other people, why, why you gain for them? You know what I mean? No, it makes no sense.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:43.760
It's no good to think. It makes no sense. They kill themselves, they kill other innocent people,

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:51.760
they damage properties, I mean a house is all right for someone like me and you, we might have

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:59.920
buy a house, it takes a lifetime to build that, make their homes into home and somebody just comes

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:10.080
along and blow it up, blow himself up. Why? You know, why, what they gain from that?

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:17.760
Don't understand. They're doing so stupid things they're doing, killing other people for what?

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:25.600
For a few, a few thousand pounds? What would they gain from that? I mean they're not alive to

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:35.680
appreciate that money they got from somebody, whatever it was, dollars, pounds, rupees or whatever

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:43.600
they got from someone who brainwashed them to go and kill other people, what they gain from it?

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:53.840
I don't know. It's very very difficult to understand and I'm sure there's no, 100 percent

00:29:53.840 --> 00:30:02.080
there's no religion or no culture will say this is right. Is there anything that you want to add

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:10.400
about making a life in in Main Day or other memories of Community House or where you think

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:19.360
or what we could be doing to sustain what goes on here? Like I said, I, it's difficult for me to

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:24.800
suggest or say because I haven't been involved in anything for ages now.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:34.000
Most of my time is spent at home and I go to mosque here twice a day but

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:42.080
the interest I had when I was younger age, they all sort of gone. It's not,

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:49.760
I just don't know what to suggest. But I, like I said, I would love to see this place

00:30:51.600 --> 00:31:00.720
keep going, keep going and people should run it because it is for the benefit of other people

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:10.800
and they should benefit from it and start letting it run down or close down. It'd be shame.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:22.240
To see it being closed like the churches or the mosque. It's good to have it running.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:29.200
I come across some very nice people when I've been doing the project and finding out about their

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:36.240
lives and what they've done. It's amazing. You know, it was an Asian evening then we came

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:42.960
international club, we called it because there was a lot of people. But it was happy days.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:50.080
You know, people got together, we used to have different nights. You know, we used to meet twice

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:57.360
a day. We used to have different nights, organize different functions on our special days like

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:06.480
play up small dramas or cooking night or something. It was quite nice.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:14.720
Social media and internet is killing all the relations because people are more interested

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:19.040
in the gossip and what's happening to that person, what's happening, what's he doing,

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:27.120
what she's doing. All these stories, they're interesting and there is still a lot of good

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:34.480
people who are helping out and they're trying to do good in the world. It's not sort of

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.160
finished everything, it's still hope.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:44.560
There people are still doing good and there's good people out there.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.760
I'm glad there's still quite a few things going on.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:55.520
The government is used to fund it, to run it as a community, house and church.

00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:01.040
Then everything is sort of changed, they stopped everything. It is a good cause

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:06.000
for the community and it's keeping the community interested and together.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:12.240
It's a very helpful place for people around here. It would be a shame to see it go.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.880
It would be a shame to see it go.

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:26.880
My hope and my appeal to the people who have got the resources to keep it going, please keep it going.
