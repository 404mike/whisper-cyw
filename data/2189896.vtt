Hi, I'm Vicki MacDonald and I'm in Holy Trinity Church, Flandernow, and I'm speaking to people

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.440
during the longest yarn, and I'm speaking to Sonia Bird. Sonia was born before the war and

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.120
she has some memories of the war and other memories of people that she knew during the war.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.160
Thank you, Sonia. So tell me a little bit about when you were born.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:29.440
And I was born in 1941 in Staffordshire. I don't really have very memory and very real memories

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.200
of the actual war, except what my sister, who was six years old, told me. Apparently,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:44.080
I spent a lot of the time doing, if there were any raids nearby, in a carricot underneath an oak table

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.640
down in the cellar of our house, which with hindsight you'd think if we'd been bombed,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.040
we'd all have been buried, probably killed. I do vaguely remember playing in the snow in the garden

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.200
in the remains of an old Anderson shelter that my father and uncle had built for us.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.520
And apparently we did actually spend a few hours there at times, but we felt safer in the house

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:15.760
down in the cellar. This is all being told to me by my sister. For what it's worth, I have an uncle,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.080
had an uncle, who, to tell you a bit, my uncle. My mum told me about a time when

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:32.080
she remembered during the war when her brother, who was in the army as an engineer, he came home

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.360
and he used to give her sixpence to polish his boots. And apparently he didn't speak about the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.760
war for years afterwards, but she gradually learned that he had been driving an ammunition lorry

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.560
to the front line and his friend, whom he'd grown up with, gone through training college with,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.720
was driving another one, more or less parallel to him. They came to a tree,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.400
his uncle went one side and his friend went the other side and the friend hit a mine and exploded.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.240
So that was what had upset him and he couldn't talk about it. It was just simply a

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.640
providence, a matter of luck, that he was the one that lived and the friend didn't.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.400
So when you hear about that, you know, it makes the head on the back of your neck stand up and

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:27.920
think how close the shape it was. His son was training as a glider pilot and he got his wings

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:35.920
or whatever the terminology was. The day before peace was declared, so he never actually had to

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.240
fly a glider to drop off people and other soldiers in France and then make his own way back,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:50.560
which would have happened if it had been a few more days. My father wasn't called up because

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:58.400
at the time he was a sink man and he worked in a factory, still tube industries, I think it was

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.360
called, and they were making all the tubes that go in aeroplane engines, possibly spitfires.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:16.880
And so his factory was always being searched for by the Nazi bombers, which worried my mother a lot.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:25.040
She used to look over the fields towards where the factory was near Walsall and she saw this big glow

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:33.360
in the sky and she thought something dreadful has happened. She could tell it was a major fire.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.920
It transpired that it was the date Coventry Cathedral was bombed. I have seen that since

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:49.600
and what a marvelous job it's been made of to rebuild it. My father didn't survive the war,

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:58.560
but he was a sick man and he died when he was only 53. I'm trying to think of some more.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.320
I can't think of anything else.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.800
Thank you so much Sonia. I think those are really wonderful memories. Thank you.
