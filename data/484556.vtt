Interviewee June Campbell-Davies.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
June, could you spell your full name for the record please?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.000
J-U-N-E C-A-M-P-B-E-L-L-D-A-V-I-E-S.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Thanks June.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Well, opening shot, could you explain how you first became or experienced Carnival in the UK?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Okay, when I was quite young, maybe sort of 15, 16 years old, my dad used to take me and my sister to Carnival, Notting Hill Carnival.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:08.000
In London, and it's such a massive event, and we just basically used to go down and just stand on the side and watch the Carnival floats, listen to the steel pan.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And then he would just say, well let's go along and we'll find a favourite group and we'll just tag along behind.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:27.000
There'll be hundreds of people and we would just sort of, they call it chipping where you just kind of have this little miniature sort of jog walk with the band that you're following.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And it was usually really loud, your eardrums would be ringing for days afterwards.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000
But that was brilliant because you just go for miles and miles on end and you'd be tired, you'd have a stitch and your feet are hurting but you still keep going.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And I think we did this for a couple of years and I'd be, every year, as soon as school finished, I'd be thinking, can't wait to get to Carnival.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So that was my first experience and it's never left me.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And obviously when I moved to Cardiff, there wasn't any sort of Carnival as such until one year I saw, I was in town shopping and I heard this drumming from somewhere.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And I just saw this sort of like loads of people dressed up in the costumes I can think of.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
All I can remember now is like whites and blues in blocks and just traveling, dancing down St. Mary Street.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I just couldn't get over it.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And that was my first image of...

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I think you were an innocent bystander who saw the very first Cardiff Mars Carnival in 1990.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
That was a traditional sailor Mars influenced by tradition from Trinidad.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And then a number of years later, you got involved in the Carnival for the first time.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Tell us more.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I had my daughter, she was about five then, and I used to go to dance classes at Rubicon in Splott and Jane Bellamy and Sally Verrell used to do a lot of community projects.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And they happened to mention that they are being involved in this Carnival.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And I thought, great, because I'd seen...

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I've always missed it because I think me because I was going to Notting Hill, so I was never around when the Carnival was happening in Cardiff.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So I thought, well, you know, this will be great.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So it would be great to get feel involved because they said, anyone, you don't have to pay.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I couldn't get over you didn't have to pay.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
You just turn up.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Everything was free and people would help you make costumes.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And I thought, wow, this is brilliant.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So they told us to go along to Cattay's Terrace Community Center and went along.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And that was it was it just blew my mind when we walked in because they happened to be everything happened to be people making costumes.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
They had drummers on one side.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
There was a little area where people would dance.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And I used to think, well, where are they going to do the dance?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Because there's no space.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
But somehow they managed to clear the space and people learned to dance.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And Jane was leading some of the dance sequences.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And we didn't really know what group we were going to involve, but we just came along and we would just help making something.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And I just really was just trying to get feel involved.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And it didn't take very long to start a conversation talking to people, complete strangers.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
That was I found quite amazing because it's quite daunting when you walk into a place and you don't know where to go.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I do I do remember a lady called Shona who had this amazing dreadlocks, blonde dreadlocks and sort of toolkit and just kind of like a little

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
toolkit and just coming up with a really lovely friendly face coming up and saying, oh, you know, what would you like to do?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Oh, we need this. And I'm just just helping.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And I was just gobsmacked.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
But that was my that's my and my daughter's first experience.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And we the procession was quite a short procession, but it was just brilliant anyway, because what I didn't realize was that the drummers were going to be drumming as well.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I don't know why. You just don't connect everything together.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
You just sort of hell bent on making what you make and make make making friends.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And then on the day when everyone gets kitted out and you line up and then you start parading through the streets.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And that was fantastic. And then we ended up on the museum stairs and there's all these lights and sound and just seeing the general public behind this barricade, which was I don't know how thick it was.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
It was like maybe 10 rows thick.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And that was just amazing. And we were on a real high and feel just loved it.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
We just couldn't wait when it was over. It was like we want more.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
So obviously his daughter, Fionn, grew up with the Carly Carnival.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
What sort of impact do you think it's had on her in her younger days?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And can you trace through to her more recent professional development?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Well, well, she just loved it because we were able to take one of the little headdresses.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.000
It was like from that that particular card, we kind of it was like some sort of purple sparkly and kids like sparkly stuff.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
We have to take the mask home or something.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And she was playing with a lot at home.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And I do remember her not being it can't can't wait for the next year.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And she would be really she wasn't always a hyper, but she's quite quiet child.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:05.000
But at school, she said, Oh, mom, the kids keep telling me I'm mad because, you know, I'm just like, I do all sorts of strange things, whatever that was dancing around or whatever.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And she said, if only they did carnival, they'd understand.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And I was like, I was like, oh, my gosh, she really does.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
She really does like it. I mean, the thing is, at home when we put music on and she'd be dancing and dressing up.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And that's the I think the thing for young kids that they can express themselves.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And, you know, we dance a lot at home and everything, but dressing up and putting on and making designing, what have you.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
So every year we had to go religiously for carnival.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
We would try and find out when it was happening and we would go down and we'd learn the dances.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And she would she just had enormous energy.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I think when most kids will probably stop and cry and they're tired, she'd just keep going.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
She's a bit like a sort of Duracell batch.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
You just keep going.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And so, yeah, every year she's probably she's got involved.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And the last couple of years, she's she's worked with Swicker helping out on the team and she has an interest in art.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
So that kind of naturally sort of fell into place.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:11.000
So, you know, with the advice of other artists just helping, she was able to kind of just get an idea of making stuff and putting that together,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
helping other people put her own artistic input as well.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
So it's been a real it's been a real she really looks forward to it.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
She gets a lot out of it.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000
She didn't I think when she left to go away to train for three years in London and she came back, she and she got involved again.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
She's thought, God, I really miss this.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
I'd really missed and value how important it is to be creative in that way.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
So I thought, oh, that's good.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:45.000
What's wonderful is she falls in those bracket of people who originally had contact with Cardiff Carnival as community participants.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Yes. And now they're part of the professional team who help animate and inspire.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Yeah. Of course, your role has been primarily about movement.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
But we know you can wield a glue gun like a man.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Yes, you learn. That's it. You learn as you go along.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:12.000
I must admit the early days I was just coming in just to kind of, you know, get high, dance on the street, make your costume and have a good good burst of energy.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000
I remember there was one dancer and I'm wondering if it was a carnival that was maybe it was a carnival.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
It was some event in Channel View.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:29.000
It's a lady called Jenny Barbieri and they had Zamba Gala's playing and she managed to get a whole lot of dancers, professional dancers.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
This would be a Zamba Dome event.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Was that what it was?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I remember.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And that was amazing because we kind of filled, the whole place was filled in Channel View.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
But she managed to get all these costumes together.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And I think she went to Sari shops and kind of got this fabric and billowed out these, you know, these, these, I don't know what kind of dancers we were.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
I don't know if we were Bayana. I don't know what kind of.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
But it was fantastic.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And that was another memorable moment.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Fiona wasn't born at, I don't know, Fiona wasn't around at that time, but I remember thinking this is really great.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
We didn't take to the streets with that, but that was indoor.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And that was fabulous.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Of course, I mean, whole generations of Cardiff Carnival revelers and participants have to thank you for personally releasing their inner dancer,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
inspiring and encouraging them and getting people to move.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Even the classic, Oh, I can't do that.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
People, I've seen you.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Well, as you say, it's all about the arts of transformation.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
But on top of all the movement, of course, there is the costumes and the rest of it.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Given your long 18 year history of association with the Cardiff Carnival,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:53.000
do you have some memorable standout costumes that you've played that have meant something special for you whilst performing on parade?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
There there's a few. Let's see now.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:04.000
There was one year where it was called Mask, I think the Mask, Mask, Harade.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And we we all had to design sort of masks of some sort.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And I remember who was working alongside me.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
We had Melissa, because she's very good at Zamba dancing.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And there were some really nice designs.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And there was one that was a bit like sort of burlesque, but with sort of Victorian flouncy sort of skirts.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And and we had a lot of people actually get involved.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
So you didn't have time to work on your own costume.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
But I remember thinking, God, I'd really like to kind of I really like a costume like that.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:46.000
So while we're there busy helping other people get stuff together and and you know, by the third week, you still have to get sequins on and more feathers and more.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
I just thought I'll never get my costume together.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
But I remember I had something at home, an old skirt that I had.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And I thought, right, I'm going to design my own little kind of damn Lorraine character.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And it was this old lady.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
The only thing I could make, we had time to make was our masks.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
So we had a little half face mask and feathers.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And I had this damn Lorraine character and I sort of stuffed at my bottom with huge buttocks so that my Victorian green and black dress could hang outside.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
I thought, right, I'm going to be an old lady.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And it was a year that we had this sort of dragon feature.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
We had this massive red dragon leading the parade.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And and I was just normally I run up and down and help out, get people zip tied and what have you.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And I thought, no, I really need to let us team.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And I paraded up and down in character.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I still help people get in and out of their costumes and develop art.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
But I remember thinking, I'm going to stay in this old character.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Let's see how long I can stay in this old character.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And because I noticed a lot of people bystanders are watching and they were really serious.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
They were didn't seem to be enjoying.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
I thought, this is ridiculous. This is a colorful event.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
It's not raining. It's brilliant.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
And we've got people maybe they don't understand what it's about.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.000
So I had gone up to a few people who were serious and kind of waved my umbrella at them and then wiggled my bum.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And it's only when I wiggled my bum that I managed to get a smile out of them.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
So and that was that was fantastic.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Yeah. Another memorable costume was well, we didn't have much of a costume actually.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
But it was a memorable event was being part of the Blue Devils.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:24.000
We had a guy called Spooky had come over and he said that this is some kind of thing where everyone gets painted blue.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And they have some rope tied around their waist and you've got some sort of devil wings.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And there was a particular drum beat and you would again it was it was a way of suddenly you became a different character.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Not you know, you just suddenly you're somebody else and you could be as impish and just wicked and devilish as you want.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Or you could you could just be really nice and you there was an opportunity to go up and beg for money.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
But we didn't do that. But unfortunately, some of the kids did that.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
They enjoyed it. I think it's quite close to sort of Halloween where they can let you know trick or treat.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And if they didn't pay you, if they didn't pay and then they would get splattered with blue water.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
But that what was interesting about that one was that you realize you had such power.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
People were absolutely freaked out by you if you looked at them, if you just looked and they didn't want to look at you.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And I remember that was quite that was quite a memorable experience.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Unfortunately, it rained as well. So but it didn't stop us.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
We just continue to, you know, go and do what we did.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:38.000
I know that for my costume, I had the first time I wore a kind of corset and I had to use some blue material to kind of emphasize the your derriere backside.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And I had some really nice high cut knee boots.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Unfortunately, my heel broken one of them. So I had one heel.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000
So I felt like a sort of semi goat. So that's that's why a memorable and another memorable one.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And another carnival much earlier, probably 2000.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And I don't know what it's to do with the citizenship.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
I think it's 2002 and that was working with Jane Bellamy.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:11.000
And we had to to the backpacks were like two blocks of flats.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
It kind of it kind of went up in a kind of semi pyramid.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And and it was also a bit kind of awkward to dance with.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
But it was quite memorable because it could have stood out.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:27.000
I remember remembering looking at photographs, it stood out from all the rest of what was being made that these tower blocks.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I'm not even sure if it's to do with nine and low.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And I don't know. But anyway, I remember that being quite memorable.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And the choreography, because Jane was very good at kind of, you know, getting things to change direction and getting people to cross over,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000
which sometimes isn't easy when you got people who involved in the dance and who haven't had much dance ability,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:53.000
but she kind of persevered. And that was interesting also because we were working somewhere down in the down in the bay.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
There was supposed to be the old Casablanca used to be.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
There was a building there that we kind of rehearsed in there.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
And it was the first time we had a really nice dance space with two levels.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
So it's kind of memorable and special, memorable again, because we had I'm going off the tangent here.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000
I remember one girl falling off off the railing somehow and got impaled.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
There was quite it was that was the only sad bit of the whole thing.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
We just thought what a wonderful place.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And then we and we couldn't work there again, I suppose we didn't, you know.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:32.000
But yeah, those kind of three that really stood out as obviously the vast majority of our audience while we're praying,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
enjoy, appreciate and even applaud.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:49.000
But back in the mid 90s, you had a very unpleasant experience in public, but which I hasten to add,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
I think you brought to well, a certain amount of natural justice was served.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Would you care to tell us more about that?

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
I was again dancing.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000
I was actually wasn't actually working part of I was like a participant coming in dancing with Jane Bellamy's group.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Can't remember how costumed as such.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
And I was with another mother, Marion.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
I don't think feeling was feeling wasn't around then at all, actually.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:22.000
But Marion and both of both of us were in this section dancing and we were parading through a number of different places.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
In this section dancing and we were parading through a new part of Cardiff.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:33.000
I remember where we have the the market and where you have the stairs that goes up into Argos.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
That was kind of fairly new.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
So we were parading around there and that's an area where we stood for a bit.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And also the pedestrian could they could stand up on the stairs and look down as we were passing through.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
And we noticed there was one guy we had whistles.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
We could blow whistles and make our own little sort of our own sound as we went along.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
We noticed one guy had come in from the crowd into the group.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
And we were a bit annoyed because we're doing the choreography and he was getting in the way.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
But we didn't we just thought, oh, maybe he'll just surpass us and go off.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.000
But he didn't. He just kept he was just there kind of hanging about.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000
And I just remember blowing the whistle, a particular rhythm or whatever it was.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
And he just turned around, said something quite racist, spat at me,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
which really threw me because I wasn't expecting it, spat at Marion as well.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
And then he just he just ran off.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Now, the thing is, I was so I mean, I did have a small bag with me.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
And I'm really glad that I had, you know, I had a little kind of I don't know what it was.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
It wasn't special brew. I did have a little drink just to help me along the way, you know,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
with as I was dancing, as you do.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
So I was a little bit merry as well as shocked at the same time.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
I was really annoyed. I thought, I'm not going to have this guy getting over this.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
So I very quickly looked around to see if there was any cameras around.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
And then I just charged off to try and chase him as he went through the car.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.000
And I kicked him up the backside and ran back, hoping that he wasn't going to wasn't going to find me.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
So it was a bit of a cat and mouse kind of thing going on.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
But I was so miffed because I thought this has never happened before.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
And we did report him to the stewards.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
And we looked to see where he'd gone because there's a lot of people.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
He'd gone up the stairs and we'd seen that he'd changed from what he was wearing into something else.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
He put a jacket on or something.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
I don't think they I think they must have questioned him, whatever.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
But by that time we had to carry on.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:33.000
But that was the most unpleasant thing. That's never we never had any racist anything.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Racist happened to us or abuse or anything.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000
But that was that was a bit that moment there was a little bit worrying because I wasn't sure what he was going to do.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
I'm sure I must have swore back at him in shock and horror.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
But I'm glad I gave him a kick.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
I just think it's fabulous that you had the last word kicked about the bum.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Oh, I that that made me feel better.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
I'm not sure if I hadn't had that lager.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
I don't know what I would have done. I probably wouldn't have done that.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
It's not what one should do.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:10.000
As somebody who's had contact with the carnival, both as participants and as the most fabulous colleague and choreographer and dance tutor,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:18.000
for we reckon that you've had contact with 18 years of Cardiff Carnival, which makes you a carnival hero.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:27.000
If you had any thoughts about the future or the importance of Cardiff Carnival, would you care to share them with us just to end the interview?

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Yeah.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
What's it all about? Where's it going? Why are we here?

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Do you know, I think I think what them know, as I've seen carnival over the years in Cardiff and I think what's really

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:47.000
magical about it, apart from when we go out on the street and you actually see the work that's gone into what people have made,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
I think it's really important. It just brings people together.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:59.000
And I think that's it's amazing what it does. Just the fact you come in and you make you make you you help make other people's costumes or you help make your own.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
And you can talk to somebody who you've never met before.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
I think it's really great at breaking down barriers.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Some people, a lot of people still, you know, maybe at home they don't do anything.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
They might be out of work, they might be disabled, they can't get out.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
And it really brings people out. And I think it's fantastic that it's free.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
I think people still don't realize that it's free, even though we get all the leaflets out.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:35.000
They're still amazed. People still forget sometimes that it's on this particular day, because when they see it and you see their faces, it's like they are, you know, they're in awe of it all.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000
And it's changed from I remember from the very beginning, it was a bit more I wouldn't say the costumes.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:50.000
They were a bit more, I suppose, creative in a sense that you might have an idea and so that it might slightly veer off a little bit.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.000
So there was room for creative experiment. I think now we're looking at more detail.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:06.000
So in a way, as well as it looking beautiful and polished and exquisitely made, there's detail in there and people are learning.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:13.000
I think people are learning more from the skills of making something, maybe much more than they did earlier on.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
I think I didn't when I first participated. It was a case of just stick it whatever on.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:25.000
But now I'm thinking, right, if I had to go and do this and I wasn't involved in Cardiff, I think I can remember how to make a template.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
And so there's some sort of skills that are being passed down and around.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:39.000
I think what is really still difficult is getting people from different areas of Cardiff to come into one area to participate.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000
So, you know, you won't be from Adamstown or from Ely or they're still really difficult.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
And I don't that's because that's what Cardiff's like.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
So but I think it's I think it's a really important thing that has to keep going.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Even with all the cuts, I think Carnival is one way of getting people together of all different age groups.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.000
It's something that makes people feel proud of their city, whether it's raining, snowing or whatever.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
That galvanizes people onto the streets.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
They come together for a special moment.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:21.000
And and again, for those who have been with the car on and off, who've maybe been in the early days and come back later on, it's a bit like Christmas.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
You don't see people for a long time.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:30.000
And it's that once a year we all gather together and celebrate, celebrate life, celebrate, catch upon what people are doing.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
And I think I think it's amazing that it's just keeps going and it keeps evolving.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
And I think things do have to evolve.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
I don't know which way.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Hopefully it will still happen.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
But I think it's it's it's it's fantastic.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000
June Campbell Davis, I repeat, you are a carnival hero and many, many thanks for the interview.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
And thank you.
