Welcome to Mouth Off, a podcast brought to you by Forget Me Not Productions.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:13.520
My name is Clary Sadler and on today's episode I'm going to be talking about the iPlusMatter project,

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:20.640
which is a heritage lottery funded project conceived by T. Gwynn Special School in Cardiff

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.880
and inclusive arts organisation Forget Me Not Productions.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:32.160
iPlusMatter provided multiple opportunities for meaningful assistive technology experiences.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:40.080
These were interwoven with the arts and music was used as a motivator to enable individuals

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:47.280
with the most complex physical and cognitive disabilities to share their own history and

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.080
celebrate their independent achievements. The project was launched in February 2020 and was

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:01.200
due to conclude in July of that year. We were going to have a training event called iPlusMatter

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.920
Festival and it was going to involve professionals in the field of special education and social and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.640
health sectors. It was also going to be a celebration of the achievements of all involved.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.680
The participants would use a range of assistive technology such as eye gaze, switches and touch

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:30.320
monitors in order to help them achieve and independently take part in music and arts sessions.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.440
Due to Covid-19 the project was postponed and we had to adapt the sharing event and the training

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.240
event to fit a virtual platform. Pupils at five local special schools, adults from a local day

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.880
centre and three individuals all with complex needs took part in assistive technology and

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.480
inclusive art sessions called MusicCan. MusicCan is a protocol developed by ForgetMeNot production

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:05.760
and it uses music primarily as a motivator to engage individuals with the most complex needs

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.400
in assistive technology. T Gwynn School with the project lead and other partners included

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.960
Miceblu Special School, Trinity Fields Special School, Park Lane Special School, Gadliss Day

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.880
Centre and three private clients that had all worked with ForgetMeNot productions in the past.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:33.520
Most of the face-to-face MusicCan sessions had resumed by the end of 2021 but sadly due to ongoing

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:40.400
Covid-19 restrictions Trinity Fields Special School had to pull out. Luckily a Skolhenvelen

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.000
Special School stepped in and had the remaining sessions enabling us to wrap up the project.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.520
So what exactly do we mean by assistive technology? Well for the purpose of this project we're using

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.920
the term assistive technology to include any specialist technology that enables access to a

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:07.680
computer. So things such as switches, touch monitors, eye gaze which is a computer that is

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.480
operated by eye movements and these are linked to specialist software for teaching cause and effect,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:21.120
choice making and beyond, augmentative and alternative communication or AAC, specialist

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.440
controls for wheelchair driving and access to toys and play. So when eye gaze first became

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:36.320
commercially available it was really mostly suited for people who were already at a level of using

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:44.640
AAC and perhaps using AAC with switches, switches being very effective but slow, slow and laborious.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.280
Another focus of iPLASmata has been to provide staff members with the opportunities to be trained

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.120
in the implementation of assistive technology systems for those with the most complex disabilities.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:04.720
Why do you think projects such as this iPLASmata funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund are so important

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.000
for the individuals that have been taking part from your school? Well it's the assistive technology

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.840
like we did have eye gaze and hearing machines here but they were and they've become older,

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.320
they've been broken and they're obsolete. So it's only now that we've started to use the eye gaze

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:27.520
because we've already started your project at Brotson and we're using one pair of the second eye gaze in.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.080
So we're trying to re-establish those and also we want to start training the staff

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.600
and really to see what opportunities we can use with the eye gaze. It's wonderful with your project

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.320
because you can see how well the children have responded to it and how much you really need that

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.280
in our school. What have been the main benefits that you've seen from the individuals that have

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.720
taken part in the project? So to see how much they've progressed in the two weeks has been amazing,

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.320
I think it's fantastic. When they get to experience technology and staff get to see what they're

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.720
capable of by using that technology which gives us input as they're to move forward with purchasing

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.360
of our skills and developing those skills and pupils get to be able to be part of a project,

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.480
parents can share and see that project and see what the children are working on and I know the

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.920
way that our pupils have responded, they've been focused and they've really enjoyed it and I think

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:30.800
music is such a wonderful access around pupils anyway. So it's just a wonderful way for them to

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:38.080
be focused and to be able to get into that niche and they are there. What are the main barriers

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:45.120
for these individuals achieving independently within a school or daycare setting? The challenges

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:52.240
they need more like consistency constantly and you need more technology things to come in for

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:58.960
the children to help them progress higher than they already are. One of the main aims of the

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.440
project has been to empower individuals identified as experiencing profound and multiple learning

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:13.200
disabilities or individuals that have complex physical disabilities. These individuals use

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.960
assistive technology to experience independent achievement and throughout the project we use the

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:26.480
MusicCan framework to motivate engagement with this technology changing and shifting the focus

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:34.560
from disability to ability. When I started making music with Forget Me Not productions it changed

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:41.600
my life. Music transformed me. We hope to raise awareness also of the historical development of

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:48.000
assistive technologies and the potential impact for independent learning via new technologies

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.320
and new techniques. We speak to Mel Sadler about the history of assistive technology.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.640
But of course by far the biggest development for assistive technology particularly for those

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:06.480
individuals with the greatest cognitive impairments has been the development of eye gaze.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.880
So eye gaze worked really well for that group of people straight away but it took some time for

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:18.720
eye gaze to be suited for software to come out and be made available for people with more

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:25.120
significant intellectual impairments as well as their physical disability. But once software such

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.640
as Look2Learn and Sensory Eye Effects and some you know some of the inclusive technology

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:37.440
softwares became available for eye gaze users it's really opened up a whole new world for that group

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:46.720
of learners which is just just amazing and you see people making choices using eye gaze

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.040
who I would have considered it being very difficult to teach them to make choices using

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:57.360
switches because using switches to make choices is a much higher cognitive load if that makes sense.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:06.400
Yet they can do it with eye gaze. We also talk to assistive technology guru

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:12.320
Carol Thornett. Dr. Carol Thornett has been involved in the field of assistive technology

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:18.720
since 1986. She was a pioneer in exploring the use of assistive technology with individuals

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:24.160
experiencing profound and multiple learning disabilities. In fact it was Carol that developed

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.920
the Thirst Mobility Platform which was originally part of the Spastic Society Research Project

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:36.240
and had the aim of enabling children with cerebral palsy to explore mobility when their peers were

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:41.840
able to. With the mobility we're trying to get children mobile at the same age that their peers

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:49.040
would be mobile since they've extrapolated those with learning difficulties and physical difficulty

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:56.080
obviously as well. But initially it was just a physical disability. That proved to be really

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:02.880
exciting and I think it's quite sad now that I've seen so few with independent mobility.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:10.400
They should be in their usual seating because that was always such a problem if they went to

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:18.160
a wheelchair service in that what seating would they use. So this was you know that's the reason

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:25.120
why it was a platform that you could attach the whole seating system so that you started by looking

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:31.760
at whether they could control it and what they would do and did they stop and stop as important

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:38.560
The historic Cragher Park School has also been our heritage partner throughout the I plus Matter

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:45.360
sessions. Cragher Park House is a country house in Pentirk, Cardiff. It was built in 1914 for a

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:53.200
colliery owner named Thomas Evans. Evans died in 1943 and Cragher Park then came into the possession

00:09:53.200 --> 00:10:00.560
of the National Coal Board before being sold in 1954 to the Spastic Society. They opened a residential

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:08.080
school site in 1955 and the house still operates as a residential care facility today. It is also a

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:14.720
special school for young adults with learning disabilities which is operated by Salutum Healthcare.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:21.360
The school I work in is catered for people with disabilities. Research the school you're going to

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:28.800
work in and the students you're going to work with and then it's just a case of getting to know your

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:37.120
colleagues and them getting to know you and that should make your job hopefully a lot easier.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:48.080
That was one of the first things people used to look at and say. Last time probably a student

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.440
but that doesn't happen anymore because I'm older and I grow beards and stuff like that so

00:10:54.080 --> 00:11:02.880
that does not happen anymore. Well my powered wheelchair it can well the batteries last longer

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:10.960
which means I can stay out for longer I can socialize for longer and be in work for longer

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:21.600
and secondly my power chair then can also so as you can see the chair the chair I'm sitting in

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:29.520
is actually rising which then also helps me in my job professionally when I'm working with students

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:37.520
with standing frames who are in standing frame sorry and also helps me socially when there is

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:43.760
no seating available for other people I can then rise myself up to the level that the person is

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:52.080
standing to and then when I'm when I'm done you just go back down so it's basically far different

00:11:52.080 --> 00:12:00.720
now to how it used to be there's no comparison because now I can turn lights on using my voice

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:11.520
whereas when I was younger I wasn't able well I wasn't able to read I wasn't able to really

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:17.920
reach the light switches due to them being on a different level. What would you say

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:26.640
you're most proud of something you've achieved maybe through your use of technology that's helped

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:34.720
you achieve that thing? It could be related to school or it could be games games

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:49.680
and remote control controls. So you're quite the expert when it comes to games and remote control.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:58.800
Yes I need help trying out accessible instruments I need help accessing music tech and recording

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:03.440
studios. This is what we're doing through us really isn't it I guess remotely in the house

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:11.200
when I started making music with forget me not productions it changed my life music transformed

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:18.720
me I feel like I'm finally using my brain properly join me next time when I interview

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:32.400
