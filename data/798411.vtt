I'm just really interested in finding out about local ciders and parries and just trying

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.660
to open my eyes to different things really.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.980
I came here last year and it was really good so I just had to come here again because it's

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.980
just a brilliant day.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.900
There's so much to do and see and drink obviously.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.540
Yeah, it's just a fantastic day.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.500
I'm here with a group of my friends and it's the first time I've been to the cider festival

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.540
and it's really nice that we can taste a few different ciders, picking out the best ones.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.580
So we've been writing them in the book and the Three Saints Blush is a quite light sweet

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.260
cider so that's quite a good one.
