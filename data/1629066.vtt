lot of sharks. I saw, I remember seeing all nine or ten poor beagle shark in two or three

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.480
trips. We did some very close together trips. Loads of sharks. Would that have been in the

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.480
80s, 90s again? Yeah, early 90s. And again, if you see one shark, there's probably ten

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.200
down there. It's a bit like rats. If you see a rat, there's ten. If there's one shark,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.120
you're probably dozens you're not seeing. And I'd always, again, I always wanted to,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.000
I kept on thread loads of people. I was talking to Mark Reese about the other day. I was down

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.760
there and I'd always say, you know, what I'd love to do down there is go down to the Celtic

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.480
deep and chum out the 24 hours because you'd never know what would come up, you know. And

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.120
obviously that's what's happening now. They're getting, there was a massive Mako caught the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.600
other day down there. I think it was 800 pounds. Well, they estimated they didn't land it.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.360
You're getting, you know, blue sharks there.
