Western.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.620
OK. And that's all of you. Did you live in a big house when you were in Jamaica?

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.620
Well, what would I call it? Two bedroom, a veranda.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.620
And what do you call it? With a little.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.620
Two bedroom and a dining room.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.620
Right.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.620
Yeah, and a veranda.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.620
Did you live in one of those houses where you could sit in the evening on the veranda?

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.620
Yes, yes, veranda, yeah.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:20.620
OK. So once you went to school and everything, that was junior school, did you go to what I used to call big school after that?

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:30.620
No, no, no. But after that I went to a private school to further my education.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.620
OK. Where was that?

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.620
It was a church school I went to and a place named Jericho.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.620
What was that like?

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.620
Jericho in St Catherine, but the place is named Jericho.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.620
OK. What was the school like there?

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:54.620
Well, it was just like adults, not, you know, not.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.620
How old were you when you went there?

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.620
When I left school.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:07.620
OK. So when you left school then?

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:22.620
Yeah, when I left school I went to a sewing place, you know, when teachers, school parents send their children to learn to sew. I went there, yeah.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.620
The boys went to Lerne Tree, didn't they?

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:33.620
Yeah, they have a place named Tintill for the boys. But my father sent me to a school.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.620
I went to a lady that teaches sewing.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.620
Right, OK.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:50.620
What were your parents like growing up? Were they strict or were they lenient? Were they hardworking? Were they millionaires?

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.620
Oh, my father and my mother were hardworking.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.620
What did they do for a living?

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:06.620
Well, my mother, well I have to say, left me when I was small. She went to town after she had her.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.620
Town just means castle?

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:19.620
To work, yeah. But my father, I always with my father and he was hardworking, used to do like little farming, gave cows pigs goats.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.620
Did you help him with those?

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.620
Pardon?

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.620
Did you help him?

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.620
Only in the morning with the milk. Yeah, I would take the milk and come back.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.620
So it was a happy time for you in the middle of it?

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.620
Yeah, it was a happy time for me, yeah.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.620
So what was your decision to come to Britain then? What happened?

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:54.620
Well, my decision, my brother was in the RF and after the war he came out and then, you know, he decided, he came back home, bucked for it and he sent for me.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:03.620
Right, and when was that? What year was that? Roughly, how old were you do you think?

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.620
I was 29 when I came here.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.620
29?

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.620
Yeah.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.620
Okay, so that would have been about?

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.620
61.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.620
I came here 61.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.620
Yeah, okay. So your brother?

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.620
He was in the army.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.620
Yeah.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.620
RF.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.620
So where did he live at that time?

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:33.620
He was living in, when I came here he was living in Grangetown.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.620
Grangetown, so you came straight from Jamaica?

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.620
To Grangetown.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.620
Grangetown.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.620
Okay, how did you come? Was it plane, was it boat?

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.620
I came on the plane.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.620
On the plane?

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.620
Yeah.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.620
Was it BOAC?

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.620
Yeah.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.620
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.620
BOAC, 1961.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.620
Okay, so you must have been Heathrow then, is it?

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.620
No, I think it was Gatwick.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.620
Gatwick, okay. And did he come and get you?

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:12.620
He met me at the end of the, after I came off the plane we had like a train and he met me at the end.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.620
Okay, and then he drove you back to?

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.620
And take me to Cardiff.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:25.620
Cardiff, okay. So you're in Cardiff now, you've got to get a job.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:30.620
Well I had a job, when I came to Cardiff I got straight to a job.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:38.620
When my brother took me over he would already know somebody and I had a job.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.620
So you had a job to come to?

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.620
Yes, I had a job to come to, yeah.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.620
What job was that?

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:49.620
Well, I was in St. Davies Hospital but I was working in the laundry part.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.620
My mother worked in the laundry and went to hospital in England.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.620
So what was that like, was that okay?

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.620
Well, well.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.620
Did you encounter any difficulties when you first came?

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:10.620
Well, not, ah.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.620
It's only me and you talking, you can tell us.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:24.620
No, ah. Well, you know when you work with some of the people I've been asking you stupid questions if you have a horse and things like that, that where you come from.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:38.620
But my difficulty now when I left my brother and when I was in Ely and that was my greatest hell that I ever had.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.620
In Ely?

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.620
In Ely.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:45.620
Why, why, I don't know Cardiff that well, so what's the matter with Ely?

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:58.620
Well, my neighbour, I don't know what's wrong with him, whether he didn't like blocks or what, but what it is, but we can be happy.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.620
What happened?

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:05.620
Well, he used to pick on the children then.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:15.620
And they couldn't go outside and when my friend come over he pick on them and the wife, it was horrible.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:33.620
And I wake up one morning and when I looked out at the back of my kitchen, as though she used whether the bucket or what it is, she just threw the mess at the back.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.620
Oh, excrement and all that sort of stuff.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.620
Oh my goodness.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:47.620
And when I go to work and come back it's always complaining.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:49.620
Yeah.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:10:07.620
And, but then after a while my other brother that was here, his children, heard about it and I didn't know what was going on.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:22.620
But then the police came over and asked me to stop him from, stop my neighbour from coming because of all the hustling I was having.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:28.620
They were a boxer and everybody know them as a boxer.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:36.620
But to work together he said that they were coming to take him out of his house and beat him up.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.620
But I didn't know nothing about it.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.620
So, well, it calmed down a bit.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:53.620
But then the councilors that I have, everything, you know, you want this to be done and you want that to be done.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.620
And I always pay my money in advance, pay them all.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:04.620
And I couldn't, I just couldn't take it anymore.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:08.620
But then I was short cash.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:20.620
But one day I was in the house and my, my, I let her come through the door.

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:26.620
I think it was a rebate of 250 pounds.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:33.620
So I put it, I take it down to Wilson Road and I said I'm going to put this money down.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:38.620
So I, and then when I came from, yeah, I was working in the hospital, Ely hospital.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.620
I was doing nursing in Ely hospital.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:41.620
What year was this now?

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.620
This is about 62-ish, is it?

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.620
63?

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.620
No, that's right.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.620
You were here?

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.620
70s.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.620
70s, o'n i, 70s.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:59.620
I said I'm going to put this little cash down.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:11.620
I didn't know what I was going to do with it, but I started to, you know, when I get my wages and what I have left, I try to put a couple pounds down and see.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:19.620
And we were in work and all the girls then were talking and they said, oh, I'm going to buy a house.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:31.620
And I said, and then because I couldn't get no repair and he couldn't, that fellow wouldn't lay off my back.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:42.620
I said, well, when the law came out that you could buy your consulat, but I didn't want to live there.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.620
You didn't want to live there?

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:50.620
No, I didn't want to live there because I write to the MP telling the condition of everything.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:13:00.620
And well, anyhow, I go back to my, I didn't, I say to my other, to my eldest brother,

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:04.620
that I'm going to buy a house.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:09.620
And he said yes.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:16.620
Well, at that time you could pay the solicitor, but I have bought a thousand pounds.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:22.620
And he took me and I saw the house didn't beat the road anymore.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:28.620
My brother word was said, I saw one first and he said, no, don't have that one.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.620
And his word was I step out in style.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:44.620
So I went and I had no, no, I moved to be the road.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.620
I left the house and I moved to be the road.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:56.620
I had the house and at that time I think that was my happiest time.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.620
So how far is, what was it, Peter Road?

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:01.620
Beedar Road.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:02.620
Beedar Road?

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:03.620
That's in Canton.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.620
So it's a totally different area then.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.620
Yeah, yeah.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.620
So what was it like in Beedar Road?

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.620
Oh, it was lovely. It was nice.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.620
Was it a modern house?

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:20.620
No, it was one of those, there were pre-war houses, but it was big.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.620
It was a really big family house.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.620
It's our conservative dream.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:37.620
It's, you know, we have like three homes downstairs, a lounge, then there's like a dining room, and then there's another room there and then you have conservative.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:45.620
So it's like two lounge area, double lounge, dining room, kitchen.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.620
So it's quite a big house then really, wasn't it?

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.620
Yeah.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:49.620
It's quite a big house.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.620
Yeah, it's a poor bedroom.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.620
Did you ever see that guy again?

00:14:54.620 --> 00:15:01.620
Did he ever apologise? Did anything ever come of it? Did the authorities do anything about the way you were living?

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.620
They didn't do nothing.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.620
Did you report it?

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:20.620
Yeah, because it was the police that came over and told us when we were in England, told me about what was going to happen, because I did put in for an exchange, but they wouldn't give it to me.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:25.620
Okay. Okay, well, you know when you got the job at the hospital?

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:26.620
Yeah.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.620
What was life like in the hospital when you did work?

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:30.620
It was alright. It was okay.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:31.620
That was okay.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:35.620
Yeah, it was okay. It was okay. Yeah.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:44.620
So your start off in Wales then was, it was mixed then, because in work it was okay, but at home it was bad.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:49.620
And then you got this new house, so work is okay now, and home is okay.

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:50.620
Yeah, yes.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:56.620
So what did you do for leisure time? Did you have any children then?

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.620
Yes, yeah.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.620
So the kids had come over then, is it?

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.620
No, over here, over here. She came over.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:07.620
Yeah. And how many children did you have over here?

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.620
Four, five.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:10.620
Four?

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:11.620
Yeah, four.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:12.620
Four.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:16.620
Okay. And they were born from about 1960?

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.620
1960.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:19.620
1962.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:20.620
Yeah.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.620
Through to about 1970 or so.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:23.620
Yeah, 1971.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:36.620
Okay. Okay. So you were working mother and trying to make ends meet. What about your husband? How did he react to everything?

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:41.620
Well, he's the person that worked all over the place.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.620
What did he do?

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:52.620
He was an engineer. He used to work with Vauxhall and things like that, so he worked all over different areas. He never was in Cardiff.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:17:07.620
So we had to, my mum, literally, I could take my heart out to my mum because she was a mum and dad in every way.

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:17.620
She made sure that we were well kept, fed, clothed, we had clean homes, everything.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:29.620
I take my heart out to her because there's not many women I could, I wouldn't know that would do what my mum had done and put up with all the hassle.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:37.620
She'd break her heart when she'd see people hurt their children. It was really, really hard. It was very hard.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:52.620
I mean, when I came here, I came over a very bright child and yet I was put down to the lowest of the lowest class because they think that I was stupid.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.620
We'll get to that when you take us there.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.620
Yeah, yeah.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:03.620
So, okay, so then what happened? Did you get promotion in work?

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.620
Well, no.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:06.620
No.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:10.620
Okay, so did you spend all your time in the linen room?

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:14.620
Well, yes, I spent 23 years in the hospital.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:15.620
23 years?

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.620
Yes, in the hospital, yeah.

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:18.620
Okay.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:19.620
Yeah.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:30.620
Have you, what do you think of Wales? Do you see Wales as your home or do you still think of yourself as Jamaican?

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:40.620
Well, sometimes I think about Jamaica and another time I think, say, well, stay here.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:47.620
So if you had the chance, say you won a million pounds or something like that, would you stay here or would you go back to Jamaica?

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.620
I think I would go back.

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:50.620
You would go back to Jamaica?

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:54.620
Yeah, because I would have enough to survive.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:55.620
Yes, yeah, yeah.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:56.620
Okay.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:57.620
Yeah, yeah.

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:58.620
Okay.

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:03.620
So have you been back to Jamaica since the time you left?

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.620
Oh, yes, several times.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.620
Several times. What do you think of it?

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:20.620
Well, I think Jamaica is nice if you have money.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.620
Yeah.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.620
It's nice if you have money.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:26.620
Yeah.

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:36.620
Has it changed since, it must have changed, but do you think Jamaica has changed for the better or do you think it's worse than when you left?

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:50.620
Well, I think it's worse than really that one I left because, you know, when people appreciate you more when you was out there than now.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:51.620
Right, okay.

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:52.620
Yeah.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:57.620
What do you do for leisure time now over here?

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.620
Well, I go to church and…

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.620
Is church a big part of your life?

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.620
Yeah.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.620
How long have you been going to church?

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:16.620
Well, I go to church every week. I go to the Pentecostal church.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:17.620
When did you start going to church?

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:25.620
Oh, a long time ever since when I was in Ely.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:35.620
But then when I moved down, it was a bit distant to go and then after I go to the Pentecostal.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:38.620
Okay, and that plays a big part of your life.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:39.620
Yes.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.620
How often do you go? Once a week?

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.620
No, we go twice a week.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.620
What do you do in church?

00:20:47.620 --> 00:21:00.620
Well, sometimes they want you to say a bit of word, exaltation, and then I don't really want to part with it because I'm too old now.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:02.620
Okay, but you just like…

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.620
Socialise.

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:13.620
Yes, church is not just to go there and worship, is it? So church is almost like a gathering.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:14.620
Yes.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.620
And there's a gathering.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:17.620
Yes.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:24.620
Because nearly every Caribbean people, no matter which Caribbean country they come from, there's a church in their life somewhere, isn't there?

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:25.620
Yes.

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:31.620
Okay, so that's your leisure time as church. Do you do anything else?

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.620
My mum loves crochet.

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.620
Oh, see, you didn't tell me that.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.620
My mum loves crochet.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.620
I used to do a lot of sewing.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:46.620
Did you?

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:59.620
But I don't bother with it now. Bad eyes now. I don't. And the price that I'm going to pay for material in this…

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:01.620
You can't be bothered with it now.

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.620
It's cheaper.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:13.620
What has been the highlight since you've been here? Is this something you could point to and say, yes, this was my best time?

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:30.620
Well, I don't really… I really don't. Because the thing is, when I'm working, I don't go anywhere, like I said, just from work.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.620
Work to home, work to home.

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:39.620
Yes. I used to be like seven in the morning until eight in the night, so when I come home…

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:48.620
But that's why you came here, I suppose, isn't it? To work, because there's hardly any work when you left Jamaica, was there? There wasn't that much work, was there?

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.620
No, no, there wasn't that much work.

00:22:51.620 --> 00:23:07.620
O.C. Felly, yna, os ydych chi'n mynd i ddod o'r ffrindiau o heddiw, rhyw ffrindiau o beth y byddwch chi'n dysgu, beth y byddwch chi'n ddod?

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:15.620
Wel, rydw i'n ddod, rydw i'n ddod, y mlynedd o'r ffrindiau, fy mhysg, y byddwn i'n cael yma.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:20.620
Yn ogystal â beth ydych chi'n dweud, beth yw'r bwyd y gallech chi ddod?

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:31.620
Wel, fy bwyd ychydig yn ogystal â beth yw'r bwyd y gallech chi ddod, pan oeddwn i'n gwych, roeddwn i'n fwy hapio yn y Carrabyn.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.620
Mae'n fwy hapio.

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.620
Diolch yn fawr.
