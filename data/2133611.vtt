00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Okay, the time is 20 to 3 Thursday the 20th of July, part two of Becky Lloyd's interview.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So Becky, we discussed a lot of your memories over the years before the break.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So yeah, just to kind of round up the interview, would you like to tell us kind of what Mencap means to you?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Hello, hello, erm, hmm, okay I think the better, hi.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Hello, hello, I want to, I want to, so about that, that's my best friend, hello, hello, erm.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000
For the interview purposes, Becky's just put her phone away. That's what she's talking about now.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It's beeping like mad. Do you want to turn it off actually, Becky?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Hello, hello.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Hot for the lady, aren't you?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Yeah, er, so about that, it's my best friend's husband.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
That's my best friend too.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
That's not my mum, just pop it on silent.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So gooey.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So, shall I summarise where we've got so far because we've all had a quick cup of tea.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And we talked about all your work experiences, a lot about your earlier years,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
about how active you are in the community, what friendship means to you,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.000
what you do on a daily basis, the social scene, some lovely memories I have of you.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Thank you for imparting all of those.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So we've got the opportunity now, is there anything you want to talk about with regards to your home life

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000
or what you want to do in the future and what your interests are?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Is there anything that you want to talk about with regards to those?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Her.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Well that does sound interesting.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Well, actually, I've been doing a project actually since I was 16.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I've gone way back in the tree.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I've gone way back into the 1600s, 1700s, 1800s, 1900s, 1900s, 1900s.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I've gone way back into the tree.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I've gone way back into the 1600s, 1700s, 1800s.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
It's all to do with my family tree.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Wow.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Wow.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Is there anything interesting about your houses?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Yes.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Marty told me that we're, well, which is actually pretty amazing myself.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
We're actually related to Sir Francis Drake.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Really?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Wow, that's interesting.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So what do you know about him?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Could you tell us a little bit about what you found out about him?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Well, as I went on the internet to find out about it, it turns out my grandma is a citizen.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
So it'd be on my grandma's side.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000
It'd be a distant relative.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Wow, that's interesting.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Because you just mentioned your grandmother's side, but there's something I find interesting about your grandfather.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Your mum's...

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Oh, dad, yeah.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Dad.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Yeah, grandpa was Andre.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
It's really cool.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Take this...

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
You don't say Andre.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
He's got this weird...

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
It's spelled A-N-D-R.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And then you put a I-J on the end.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And do you want to explain why?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
What was his nationality?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000
He was from outside Kiev in Ukraine.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Wow, that's interesting.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I only found out about that about 10 years ago when I saw your mother's surname because she uses that maiden name.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
That's right.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Because she's an extremely, extremely good artist.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Yes, turns out my mother is a...

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Like what she said, she's an amazing artist.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
She does great, great drawings.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
She once did a picture mouse.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
An owl cat.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Then a gypsy, a daisy, cabbie.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:20.000
If you've got a picture of a pet that you want my mum to do for you, she will draw it and paint it.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
But only watercolours.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
I was about to say she's one of the most talented artists I've ever known.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
They are pet portraits.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
You've just named all your pets.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Because of course, Mike and I know mouse because he was always in our garden.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
So mouse is your cat, which is...

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
He was.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
He was, yes.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:56.000
The paintings that she does of pets in watercolours, I have never seen such a fine example.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Very talented.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Yes.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:20.000
It turns out when mum and dad first met one another, she went to art college in Newport.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:28.000
I think that's why she's so talented.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Because she did a course.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Now I'm going to tell you an interesting fact.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
You may know it, I don't know.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Okay.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:52.000
But one of the art lecturers at that college in Newport was Annie's dad.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
What? Annie?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Annie who...

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
No.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Yes.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
He was, yeah.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
He's a very famous artist, actually.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
He's actually got a painting in the Tate in London.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And he was one of the art lecturers at Newport College of Art, wasn't he?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Yeah, that's right.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
No way.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
That's where your mother has studied art.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Now, thinking about the age scales of things, quite possibly she would have known him.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:27.000
So there's an interesting fact of connections that we're seeing today.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Oh my Lord.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
So do you share your mum's talent?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Is art something that you like to do?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Well, I'm not as good as my mother, but I am really good at art.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So some of you enjoy doing art.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
We do quite a lot of art here at Mencap, actually, don't we?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
We do different projects.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
We do, yes.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And we've just been given permission to do a huge piece of art in the meeting room.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Oh yes.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Basically fill the whole wall, which is going to be about two metres by three metres.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
So we're going to be starting that soon.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
What is that all about?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
They just want a big piece of art on the, what was the computer room?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
No, the meeting room.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:20.000
They're just going to put a huge piece of abstract kind of painting on the wall.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
The guy's got free reign to do whatever we want, really.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
So that should be fun.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000
I really hope that that will get him hurt.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:39.000
I'm going to ask mum about the leptra that he had.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
His name was Keith, and it was Keith Richardson.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
So if you remember Annie's surname, which is Richardson,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
and if you think of Keith Richards, the Rolling Stones member,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
it's a combination, so it's Keith Richardson.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And see if your mother knew him.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
That would be quite interesting, wouldn't it?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
It would.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Yes.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
So moving on with the interview, Bex, is there anything else you want to discuss?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
I find that incredible, by the way.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
That's blown me away by the funny tree.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Is there anything else you want to talk about?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Your love of animals.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
You've got a nephew.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Oh, yeah.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
You've got a loving family.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
What have you jumped on then?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Right.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Now you're missing Alice.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
I never thought I would be an auntie now, to be honest.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Yeah.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I thought, I knew I would be one one day, but not yet.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:59.000
But I'm pleased that I just did get pregnant

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:15.000
because Alice is such an amazing, cheeky, cute little thing ever.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And I can see you're absolutely exuding love as you're talking about Alice.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Yeah, he's four now, and he'll be starting a mono in September.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Wow.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
They're in Monmouth.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
So he's Jess's son. Jess is your sister.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
That's right.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
You have another sister who's embarked on something special as well.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Oh, yeah.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Oh, another thing that events in the family.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
It does.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Rose's job.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
That's my sister.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
She's a flower farmer.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:12.000
But it but it burns in the family because mum's

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:24.000
grandmother and grandfather used to run a nursery in Somerset.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And they used to go there a lot.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:41.000
They'd go to the nursery and their house, massive house, called Asham House,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
had horses.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
My favorite was Caramere.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
I even got a picture of her.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Me, mum's nan and Caramere in the field.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
This is the best horse ever.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
She was a creepy colour.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
I love horses.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And this was when I was like a chocolate.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:20.000
I used to go to Asham a awful lot.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Bethany found a Christmas.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:35.000
But my first year of Christmas didn't go very well because I was ill.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:52.000
So we had to stay in shelter for my first year for Christmas.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:02.000
So a year later we went down to Somerset.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Spent time at a grandma's and grandpa's old house.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And then we'd go to Asham as well.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:25.000
I even had a picture taken with Father Christmas.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:32.000
So the relatives who run the nursery, was that your mother's grandparents?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Yeah.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Right.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
So the things I'm picking up in this interview is how things go through the generations.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
It's there, isn't it, Becky?

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
All our skills are quite often passed down.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:54.000
So I used to run this nursery with like flowers.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:04.000
So I'm guessing that a great...

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000
I'm guessing that it was more of a florist, which Rose is as well.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
She's a florist.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Her bedroom is like a ceiling, shelves, all that, all covered with flowers.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Which actually is the whole of your family.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
For a start, your sister is called Rose.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Yeah, that's right.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
So you like wearing flowers on your clothes.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Your mother does.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
I know you love the colour pink.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Yes, couture.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Absolutely. You're wearing pink as we speak.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Yes, that's always been a big part of what I think of with your family is flowers, actually.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And here's the other connection.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Rose, your sister, is actually doing the wedding flowers for my daughter coming up in September.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Oh, what?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Is she?

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Yes.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
So that's another connection.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Oh, wow.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Is there anything you'd like to ask Michael or me about anything as part of an interview?

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Would you like to ask a question?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
What like?

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Anything you want, within reason.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
No, no wrong questions.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
We haven't touched on Covid.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
How do you feel about Covid?

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Oh, right, OK.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Well, tell you the truth.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
I've never been like this at all.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:17:07.000
But since Covid has started, I've been more aware that it's around her.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:35.000
And I've been paying more attention to wash my hands, like awful lot, make sure I don't use like too hot.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:18:04.000
But I would make sure that I wash myself in a comfortable, heating in the bath or shower because it kills germs and bacteria.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:12.000
And anything that kills it is better.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Especially with.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:21.000
I'm trying not to get it.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Well, thank you for sharing that, actually.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
That is an important thing that's come out of it.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
And that's a positive thing about and the more awareness of hygiene.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
And to be honest, I think that's the case with everyone.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
I'm certainly more aware of it.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Do you want to talk about how you felt during that time?

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Or is it something that you don't want to talk about?

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:58.000
I felt like I never liked sharing hand towels.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:05.000
And because they're my own one.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
And you wouldn't believe this.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
I would believe that it's.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:21.000
So we were aware of what was happening when that pandemic hit because we all had to learn fairly quickly.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:29.000
And do you remember the rules that the Welsh government laid down about not going to supermarkets?

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Not having friends?

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
I mean, your relatives are from Somerset.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Did that affect you?

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Or how did you cope?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Well, that's only two of them.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Grandma and Auntie.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Yes.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Yeah.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Her.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
But all the other ones.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
I think exactly everything at Somerset.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
I'm not entirely sure.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
That my mum's cousin, just I.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
And.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Awesome.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000
That we don't know who are living in Somerset.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:25.000
But most of the people who live there are not a not a person anymore.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Right.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
And.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
And.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:39.000
And.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
My my my sister.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Kathleen.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
And she was a a a.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000
And.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
If you make addresses.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Her.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Seems to.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
That's it.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Yeah.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Her.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
And of course, I picked up that you studied textiles at college.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Yes, actually. So I did test on college.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
So.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Her.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
So.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:23.000
I'm not sure.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Nothing there.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
But.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
To covid and.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
It was a point where I.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
A day away down here.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
At one point.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Because.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:22:01.200
Jim, her. That was because it was a Christmas and having Auntie and Grandma

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:06.100
coming up, so I couldn't make present people for her.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:11.840
So you took the very sensible approach about not, about avoiding places here

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:20.900
where we've got groups of people in and the gym. So all in all then you've got

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:28.840
through Covid. Yes. It's now made you very aware, like I said, of hygiene.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.840
And you got through it basically, didn't you?

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:40.840
I didn't have a tiny bit of a setback bit.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:58.840
The day that I had my birthday, Dora decided to use a bit of my mouthwash.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:10.840
I didn't mean to. It was just, she totally understood after a while.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:24.840
It's just like a sharing stuff. But it comes to mouth.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:29.840
Yes. No, that's fair enough. I agree. I'm sure people will understand that.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:36.840
I'd be the same. But Dora got a tiny bit upset over it. She didn't mean to.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:41.840
Yeah, well, accidents happen, but I'm sure she understood when you explained.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:48.840
So would you like to ask Michael or me any questions? Because you've known us

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.840
quite a few years, which is probably going to come across in this interview.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:24:03.840
I'll say on Rose's, how old are you now? I'm 32. Yeah, so I'm guessing a 30-year-old.

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.840
Yeah, you've probably got quite a few memories of your mother.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:14.840
Rose, your sister and Michael have gone through school right up until to come.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:18.840
Yeah, there's Rose, me and Rose as toddlers together.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:23.840
That's right. She's October, Michael's December. That's right.

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:32.840
So Rose would have celebrated a Covid 30th, same as I celebrated a 60th during Covid.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:39.840
Not the best times. Yeah, because I remember you had white hair, white blonde hair.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.840
He did, he was white. Yeah.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.840
Albino when I was a child.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:54.840
You came over for Rose's birthday. I played in all sorts.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:25:00.840
Yeah, I remember playing in your garden and coming round for tea and stuff like that when I was younger.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:09.840
I do remember a nirvato of all three of you. It was you, Kim and Rose.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:18.840
I think two of you had your tops off.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:23.840
Do we? Probably me, I was only naked as a kid.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.840
Not much has changed.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:31.840
Just to give you a memory, you live on the back of us.

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:38.840
And I, and your dad's quite tall, a bit like Michael and my husband.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:46.840
And I've got memories of seeing you as a toddler. You were always on your dad's shoulders.

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:53.840
So I used to see toddler Becky just going past our fence every day.

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.840
Your dad Mark always had you on his shoulders.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:08.840
He had another link through Mencap. I know he's not part of, well he may be part of Mencap, I'm not sure.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:13.840
But you know, Alison. Alison Bray, yes.

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:34.840
When my dad first put me home after being born, you won't believe who was our neighbour sector.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:40.840
It would have been Alison and...Andy. And Ben.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.840
Wow. Small world.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:49.840
I just want to, I think we're coming to the end of this now with the interview.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:54.840
I would like to say to you that I've enjoyed it very much. Thank you very much.

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.840
Michael, I'm sure you have.

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:02.840
Yeah, you've done a really good job. You answered wonderfully. You've got some great stories in there.

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.840
I really appreciate you doing it. Thank you.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.840
And I hope it's been enjoyable for you, Becky.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.840
It has. It has. Good.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:16.840
Yeah, well so what we'll do is we'll go away, have a listen to it ourselves and then you can listen to the recording yourself.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.840
Cool. Yeah.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.840
Yeah, and then we'll decide maybe what bits we'd like to use for the exhibition and we'll let you know.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:33.840
And can I ask, do other people hear what I'm saying?

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.840
Eventually, if you're comfortable with that.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:36.840
Cool.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:41.840
The forms we signed before, Laska and what not, just close in.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.840
I'll find out about that.

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:51.840
Yeah, well we won't, obviously we won't play or let anything public that you're not comfortable being public,

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:56.840
but I think most of what we've spoken about is good content and I think people would like to hear it.

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:16.840
And to be honest, I do want Kenny to hear it because I said earlier that I'm pleased that I've been a night with her.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:17.840
Yeah, okay, cool.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:21.840
Alright, well we'll end it there then guys. Okay, if anyone wants to say goodbye.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.840
Yeah, bye. Thank you.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:24.840
Ta-ra.
