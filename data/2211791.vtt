WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
My first question is if you would like to tell me a little bit about

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.720
As somebody who's come to Wales

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.320
What you thought about Wales when you first arrived here?

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.040
Yeah, I would say that I always

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.000
Wales here I never live in London

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.200
but

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.200
people always

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.640
Give me London story how things are there

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.760
other lots a lot of things

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.840
but

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.840
I've seen that Wales here

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.360
Is peaceful place and if

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.960
And they are also lovely they also love people like I will say that

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.440
No, violence is not there

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.680
The way our children go to school the way the teachers take care of them

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.520
even in the workplace

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.520
How I am my colleagues

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.480
were just

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.480
living together just

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.680
Talk together even if we will for break we sit together with each I

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.120
think

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.120
Wales here is

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.040
It's a good place and quite place and lovely and supporting

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.240
Yeah, I will say that

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.880
wheels is a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.880
good place

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.600
because my colleagues those who are landing

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.560
some of them some of them are living in

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.880
Milton Keynes

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.320
They always give me there

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.960
how things are like I will say like

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.880
Rent here is more is

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.560
lower than

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.600
There there the rent is higher than here

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.440
It's good I'll say well, this is good

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.200
And has your relationship to well, I don't know how long you've lived in Wales

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.560
See this this year may

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.720
14 I'll be five years

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.720
So you've lived here quite a while

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.720
Five years

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.720
So does it feel different now after five years than it did on your first time?

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.720
Yeah, I will say it's different now

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.720
Especially the rent is higher

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.720
The time we arrived here

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.720
I think I was living with my S

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.720
The house we were living was

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.880
500

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.880
I'll say five

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.880
55 or five something

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.880
But now

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.880
The rent is higher

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.880
And you see the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.880
Even that time that I arrived

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.880
2020-29 it was you if you take like 50 pounds or 30 pounds

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.040
Go to shopping your trolley will be full

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.040
But now

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.040
No

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.040
It's costly

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.040
And the light

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.040
Everything is higher

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.040
It's higher than the time I came

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.040
Yeah

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.040
What about when you

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.040
When you look around you

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.040
You see the

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.200
Is there anything that you see that makes you think oh that's very Welsh

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.200
Yeah

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.200
What I see that is

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.200
If I want to compare

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.200
Wales city in my country

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.200
Where I'm coming from

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.200
I will say yes

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.200
Here like everything is different

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.360
From where I'm coming from

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.360
So I think it's the plan

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.360
The leaders

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.360
Know how to just put everything nice

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.360
For the people

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.360
Yeah

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.360
So when you

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.360
Is there anything that you can describe

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.360
What it

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.520
So

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.520
So

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.520
When I come back

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.520
So if I'm coming from England to Wales

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.520
I go oh

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.520
The shape of the hills is different

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.520
When I come in for example

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.520
And I know that I'm in Wales for me

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.520
Is there anything like that that you

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.520
Know that you're in Wales

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.520
So you know I just came

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.520
From my country to here

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.520
So I don't know much about it

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.520
So I don't know much about it

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.680
I don't know much about

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.680
Land

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.680
Or other things

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.680
I also went there

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.680
Like

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.680
For visit three days

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.680
I saw

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.680
Like the building there is different

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.680
With here but

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.680
I'm living here alone

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.680
Everything especially

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.680
The buildings

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.840
The buildings

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.840
The time I came

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.840
You know

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.840
One building at the train station

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.840
Yes

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.840
It was quite nice

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.840
And

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.840
The museum I went there

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.840
It was good

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.840
I was happy about that

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.840
Just when they free

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.840
It's a free thing

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.840
If you go they don't say that come and pay this

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.840
Pay this you know

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Amazing

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Going to the museum

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
It was nice for me

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Yeah

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
The museum is okay

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Me

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I would say that it was

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Amazing for me

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
That's really interesting

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Was there something in particular in the museum

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
That you enjoyed seeing

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Or that you enjoyed

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I went where

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Like I would say that

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.160
The Caribbean

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.160
The time they were here

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.160
They put their pictures in the stories there

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.160
I saw the pictures

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160
They explained things for us

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.160
Yes I was happy that

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
This country

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
To also remember

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.160
The

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.160
Caribbean

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.160
Those who came here

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.160
Begin everything their life

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.160
I was happy about that

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.160
That's really great

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.320
I'm glad that was good thank you

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.320
So

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.320
Would you feel

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.320
Comfortable

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.320
To talk about

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.320
Home

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.320
Is it okay to talk about home

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.320
What home means to you

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.320
Where I'm coming from

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.320
Both

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.320
That's interesting isn't it

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.320
When you think of home do you think where you're coming from

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.320
Do you think here or

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.320
Do you think both

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.480
Maybe both

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.480
I would just compare both

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.480
See where I'm coming from

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.480
I'm coming from

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.480
A large family

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.480
But the large family

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.480
It was just

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.480
Good

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.480
Like example if

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.480
I want to say

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.480
Me I don't like it

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.480
But the way I grew up

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.480
And met how

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.480
My fathers

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.640
Grandfathers

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.640
You know now

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.640
I think everything is changing

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.640
Marriage

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.640
Young

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.640
Is now limited

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.640
But the time back

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.640
Again

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.640
Like

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.640
15 years or 16

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.640
They will just

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.640
Call you

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.640
We want you to marry this man

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.800
You can't say no

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.800
You have to

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.800
Agree with your parents

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.800
If you say no

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.800
I will not marry this person

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.800
It's like

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.800
You are a child

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.800
That you don't respect

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.800
Your family

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.800
But that thing was

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.800
It was

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.800
Terrible it was bad

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.800
But now

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.800
I think

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.960
I think

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.960
It's now changing

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.960
A bit

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.960
And a lot back home is

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.960
About

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.960
How the train

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.960
Children is different

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.960
In here

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.960
What I

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.960
See here is

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.960
A child

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.960
Five years, four years

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.960
A child can always speak

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.960
About his mind

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.120
But he is

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.120
Like your mother do something that you don't like

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.120
Here the child will say the mama

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.120
No, no, no, no

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.120
But back home

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.120
You can't

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.120
You can't

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.120
If an elderly person says something

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.120
You, a child will feel that

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.120
No, what they said is not

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.120
It's not the right

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.120
But you can't just

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.120
Tell your mother or your father

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.280
No

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.280
But here it seems the freedom is here

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.280
For the children

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.280
To just say what they like

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.280
Or that one

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.280
I've seen that

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.280
We are also picking

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.280
Some more, some more to see back home

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.280
If that one can help us

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.280
Because the way

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.280
They train us

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.280
The way we grow

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.280
Back home, like here

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.440
You can call my name

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.440
If you are older than me

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.440
You can call my name

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.440
But back home

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.440
If somebody is older than me

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.440
I can't just call your name

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.440
I can't just mention your name

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.440
No

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.440
I have to

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.440
Add some respect

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.440
Like

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.440
Elderly man

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.440
I can't just say mama

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.440
I can't just say somebody will just call me mama

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.600
Because I'm older than the person

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.600
But here, no

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.600
Even I'm older than you

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.600
I can't just call your name

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.600
Back home, no

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.600
If I meet somebody here

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.600
I have to add the respect

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.600
But here

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.600
The person will just call your name

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.600
That's why we Africans

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.600
They say

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.600
White people always say that

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.760
Everybody in Africa is our sister

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.760
It's true

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.760
The way we grow

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.760
There

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.760
A man I will just say

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.760
Or brother

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.760
A girl, a woman I will say sister

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.760
If the older man

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.760
The older one

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.760
I will just say

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.760
Mama

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.760
But here no

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.760
That's why I've seen the different

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.760
African culture

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.920
And white people

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.920
I've seen that

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.920
Even the children also see the difference

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.920
That's why I'm saying Africa

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.920
Like the children

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.920
Here in the school

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.920
They are more happy

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.920
Back home

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.920
If a child

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.920
You made a mistake

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.920
You did something wrong

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.080
In school

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.080
A teacher can cane you

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.080
A teacher can beat you

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.080
But here it's not

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.080
It's not

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.080
Maybe

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.080
But now I think

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.080
It will be changing back home too

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.080
Like you were supposed to come to school

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.080
8 o'clock

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.080
And you came 9 o'clock

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.080
Maybe the seniors can punish you

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.240
They can give you some punishment

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.240
You came late

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.240
You were supposed to be in the school

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.240
8 o'clock and why

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.240
You came late

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.240
So in school

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.240
It's different

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.240
Back home and here

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.240
Again

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.240
Can you tell me about anything

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.240
That makes you feel

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.240
Comfortable

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.240
So

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.240
You know you get home from work

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.240
And you have that kind of

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.240
I'm comfortable now

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.240
What is it that for you makes you feel comfortable

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.240
In your day

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.240
A lot

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.240
Back home

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.240
Maybe

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.240
If you are a government worker you can work

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.400
You can go home

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.400
But if you are a farmer

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.400
You can yes

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.400
From farm you work hard

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.400
You come back home you have to cook

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.400
Do everything before

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.400
You go to work

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.400
But here

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.400
If

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.400
I want to start my work

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.400
My off days I always prepare

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.400
Something I will cook

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.400
Different kind of food

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.400
Put in the fridge

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.560
So after work

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.560
If I just come I will take my bath

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.560
I will eat

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.560
And just go to bed

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.560
And rest

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.560
Either I watch African movies

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.560
Or

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.560
I will just

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.560
Sit down relax more

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.560
And go to bed that's it

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.560
So it's different

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.560
Here

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.560
Back home

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.560
And the African moon

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.720
So is that a hobby that you do

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.720
For fun is watching African cinema

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.720
Yes

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.720
Can you tell me a bit about that

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.720
About

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.720
Is there a film that you particularly love

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.720
Or

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.720
Yes but

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.720
I always say that it's always a movie

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.720
I watch

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.720
A story

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.720
A movie that I always watch is

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.720
Something that I will watch

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.720
Like a story

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.880
The way the people live

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.880
The way

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.880
Or somebody is suffering

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.880
The way it ended

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.880
And

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.880
I pick something there for myself

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.880
That's the only movie that I watch

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.880
African movies

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.880
Something that I will just watch

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.880
At the end

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.880
I know that yes

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.880
Something in the movie touch me

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.880
And I'm happy about that

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.880
That's the movies

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.040
Thank you

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.040
So

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.040
If we were to think about

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.040
I don't know how much you've had chance to think about this in advance

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.040
But if we were to think about is there a place

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.040
That's really important to you

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.040
A place

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.040
Yeah

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.040
Now or here

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.040
Or in your childhood

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.040
Or just a place

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.040
That's somewhere that you love

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.040
Or that you want to go

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.040
Or that you want to go

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.200
Or that's somewhere that you love

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.200
Yeah

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.200
I like all

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.200
I went to the beach

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.200
Twice

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.200
The first one

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.200
I went with Baozou

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.200
Somebody was doing

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.200
His birthday

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.200
So we went there

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.200
I was amazed

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.200
I was happy about the scene

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.360
How people are there

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.360
And the food that we ate

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.360
The seaside is good for me

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.360
I'm happy about this

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.360
Seaside

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.360
If I were to go there now what would I be able to see

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.360
To see

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.360
If you were to describe it to me

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.360
I don't know how to describe this

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.360
You know if you go to see

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.520
A lot of people

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.520
You went with your friends

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.520
Different kind of food

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.520
You went there

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.520
They do a

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.520
What am I going to say? Kebab

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.520
Yes

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.520
They came there with a charcoal

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.520
And everything

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.520
We roasted a lot of meat

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.520
And other things

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.520
And some came with food

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.520
We share and they

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.520
See the way it is

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.680
I don't know how to say

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.680
I like

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.680
The side

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.680
The sea side you see the breeze

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.680
The waves

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.680
It's always coming

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.680
It was

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.680
It was

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.680
A nice view for me

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.680
So the second time

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.680
The way I went for the birthday

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.680
I was happy

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.680
So second time I just

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.680
I decided to go there and sit down

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.840
And watch the sea

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.840
And watch the waves

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.840
And everything

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.840
So I was happy

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.840
It was a nice place for me

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.840
And it's the air

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.840
The smell of it

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.840
What are you smelling in the air?

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.840
I would just say

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.840
The fresh air

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.840
Is coming

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.840
I don't know how to explain

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Refreshing my mind

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Oh lovely

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
It was good

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
I love the sea as well

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
I love to get in and swim

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
It's cold

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
But it's

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Did you do any swimming when you were there?

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
No

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
I don't know how to swim so

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
You could paddle

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Just walk in

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
But no I never

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
I always go there and sit down

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.160
Imagine the way

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.160
The creative way

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.160
I don't know how to explain it

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.160
I was

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.160
I was amazed

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.160
I'm very lucky

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.160
Although very cold

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.160
It can be very cold

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.160
Ok

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.160
A lot of people would do this

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.160
It's a nice place

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.160
Wales is a nice place

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.160
It's peaceful

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.320
Especially where I'm living now

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.320
It's quiet

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.320
Yes

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.320
If you come to work

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.320
No noise

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.320
The place is quiet

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.320
So I was

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.320
Ok

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.320
I was living in

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.320
Back there it was noisy

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.320
Quiet

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.320
Back to everywhere

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.320
Oh it's

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.480
Yes

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.480
The quiet and the calm

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.480
Very important for you

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.480
Yes

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.480
Even where I'm living

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.480
You can see

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.480
You can see everything

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.480
The sea

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.480
I always come out

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.480
Just watch

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.480
How things are

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.480
Oh lovely

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.480
There you see everything

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.480
Just everything

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.640
How beautiful

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.640
Thank you

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.640
One of the questions I wanted to ask

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.640
Which I don't know if you

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.640
Have a particular moment in mind

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.640
Is there a point you would like to tell me about

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.640
Where things changed

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.640
Was there an important change

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.640
Where

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.640
Let's think about it

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.640
As if a magical moment

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.640
Where everything got better

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.800
Or changed or was different

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.800
Where

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.800
At all

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.800
The way things

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.800
Are going

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.800
We don't know the changing

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.800
If everything

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.800
Changed it will be better

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.800
But the way it is going higher

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.800
I can't just say

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.800
I can't say

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.800
Something about that

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.800
I can't say something

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.800
About that but if not everything

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.960
Is just changing

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.960
Higher, higher, higher

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.960
If you think

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.960
Thinking about

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.960
The future

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.960
How can our children live

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.960
Or how our generation

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.960
Is going

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.960
It's just something that

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.960
Is in my mind

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.960
Thinking about that

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.960
About what will happen for future generations

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.960
Future generations

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.120
But

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.120
The way things are changing

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.120
Things are just changing

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.120
That way

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.120
I don't know how to explain that

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.120
No, no

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.120
So when you

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.120
Thinking about when your children are

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.120
Grown up and what they will be

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.120
Living in

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.120
Do you have hopes for what it will be like

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.120
For them

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.120
Do you have hopes

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.120
For what it will be like

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.120
Hope like

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.120
I don't understand that one

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.120
Do I have hope

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.120
Do you have hope or a dream

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.120
For what it will be like

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.120
What it will be like

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.120
I'm a Christian, I believe in God

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.120
So I always say that

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.120
God will change

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.120
Things, it will be better for the

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.120
Future generation

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.120
That's

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.280
The only one I'm saying

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.280
If not the way things are

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.280
Going

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.280
Sometimes I always say

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.280
God will change it, if not

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.280
If it's going to be harder, harder

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.280
I think the generation

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.280
Coming, I don't know

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.280
How they are going to

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.280
Yeah

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.280
Do you want to talk a bit about your faith

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.280
You said you're a Christian

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.280
And that's important to you

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.280
Is that something you'd like to talk

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.440
About

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.440
Are you part of a church or

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.440
Yeah

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.440
I'm a Catholic

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.440
I'm a Catholic

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.440
You know

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.440
I'm a Christian

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.440
We have them different

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.440
Some are Catholics

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.440
Some are

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.440
The same

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.440
Christians that say we are following

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.440
Jesus

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.440
But

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.600
What we Catholics believe

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.600
Like

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.600
I would say

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.600
Anglican

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.600
Are not

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.600
Believing that much

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.600
Or Methodist are also

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.600
Different part

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.600
But my side

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.600
I'm a Catholic, the way I believe

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.600
If I have

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.600
Like

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.600
Something

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.760
That's telling me

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.760
Or something is warning me

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.760
What I believe

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.760
I always go to church

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.760
With my Rosary

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.760
With my Rosary

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.760
That's my belief

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.760
I know if I go there

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.760
Sit down, do the Rosary

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.760
The Hail Mary

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.760
The time I will finish everything

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.760
Or I read

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.760
I take my Bible

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.920
Go to read somewhere

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.920
I'll be happy that

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.920
My mind is

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.920
I refresh my mind in everything

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.920
That's my belief in God

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.920
In the religion that I have

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.920
Yes

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.920
So I believe that one

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.920
Is

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.920
A strong, a Catholic

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.920
A Catholic

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.920
Rules there is a strong for me

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.920
Something that helped me

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.080
Yes

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.080
And are you part

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.080
Of a community? Are there people that

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.080
You met through?

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.080
Yes

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.080
Africans are there

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.080
So we have

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.080
African

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.080
Community

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.080
After Mass

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.080
We go together

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.080
Like we chat or we do something

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.080
That

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.240
The

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.240
The priests always

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.240
Share like a first

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.240
Month

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.240
The first month

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.240
The first week of the month

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.240
Maybe Indians are there

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.240
The white people are there

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.240
And Africans who

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.240
The father

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.240
Always made us, we meet

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.240
The first week of the month

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.240
We can prepare if Africans are coming

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.400
With something we can prepare

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.400
Some African dishes

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.400
After Mass

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.400
Everybody will go to the hall

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.400
There we enjoy

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.400
The meal together

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.400
And

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.400
We chat and go

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.400
If it is Indians, Indians will

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.400
Always come with, they are always

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.400
They are meals and everything we take

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.400
Together

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.400
And

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.400
Oh I forgot these

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.560
Different countries

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.560
I forgot that country

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.560
So it was good

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.560
That we have community there

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.560
To just meet and chat

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.560
And do everything

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.560
I just moved to

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.560
This

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.560
I'm not

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.560
In some association yet

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.560
Yes

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.560
You mentioned there about sharing

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.560
Food together

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.560
And you mentioned that a few times you talked about

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.720
On your birthday where you shared food on the beach

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.720
As well

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.720
Yeah

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.720
Is that eating together something that's important to you?

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.720
Yeah you know

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.720
Coming together

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.720
And sharing food is

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.720
Something that is good

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.720
Yes

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.720
You know each other much

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.720
Like the way I went there

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.720
Is Ebaozo

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.720
Somebody doing a birthday

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.720
It's the day that I met

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.880
A lot of Ebaozo people also came here

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.880
So we are happy

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.880
We talk together

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.880
We eat, it was good

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.880
It was good

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.880
Some came with

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.880
Rice

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.880
A lot of food different

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.880
Some came with salad

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.880
Vegetables

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.880
It was good

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.880
It was good for us

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.880
Yeah

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.880
And one lady make this

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.040
Spinach rolls

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.040
It was good

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.040
Rice and other

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.040
It was

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.040
And it's like being together with other people

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.040
Yeah

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.040
You know

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.040
Every country with their food

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.040
So it's good

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.040
To test

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.040
Is there something

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.040
That you would share?

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.040
What would you make?

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.040
No that you know

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.200
I don't know

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.200
No but is there something that you

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.200
If you were going to

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.200
What would you make if you were going to share food?

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.200
What's your favourite thing to make?

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.200
Like Africa

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.200
We have something like

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.200
We have our doughnut there

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.200
We call it back home

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.200
Boiled fruit

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.200
So it's a bread flada

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.200
You can just mix it and do it

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.200
It's round round like this

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.200
If I was

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.360
Earlier I would just do that one

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.360
I would just make that one and go

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.360
Thank you

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.360
I love that

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.360
So we've talked a lot

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.360
About my questions

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.360
What would you

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.360
Is there anything that you would like

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.360
People to know about you

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.360
And your experience of

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.360
Wales or Bowsow

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.360
Or community here?

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.360
Bowsow community

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.360
Is a good community

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.520
Bowsow is a good

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.520
Association

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.520
The way I experience

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.520
Is a good

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.520
But if not a Bowsow

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.520
If not a Bowsow

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.520
Was not there

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.520
I think now

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.520
I could have been in Africa again

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.520
So

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.520
I would like to

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.520
To talk about

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.520
What I would like to talk about

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.680
So

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.680
I'm happy about

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.680
That the way Bowsow

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.680
Always help people

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.680
I'm happy

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.680
If not

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.680
If that support is not there

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.680
I could have been in Africa

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.680
So it's good

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.680
It's a period that

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.680
I've seen everywhere

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.680
If

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.680
Somebody is

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.680
In trouble like the way I face

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.840
I always mention

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.840
Bowsow

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.840
So it's a good thing

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.840
For me

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.840
It's a good

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.840
Thing and a good experience

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.840
I joined

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.840
Bowsow the way they've trained me

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.840
The way they talk to me

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.840
I was happy

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.840
That's really great

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:15.840
That's it

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.840
And if we were to describe

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
So I think

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
We'll finish with

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
Can you tell me

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
If you were to say

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
The thing that you are

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Really proud of

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Is there something about yourself

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
That you're really proud of

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
And that you would like everybody to know

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Yes

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
I'm proud of myself

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
I would say that

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Even the English that I'm speaking

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.160
I know it's not a

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.160
Correct English

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.160
I would say that

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.160
Like

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.160
I would say

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.160
My background

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.160
Our fathers

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.160
Education, no

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.160
My father was a farmer

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.160
So

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.160
Their hope

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.160
Their mind is just

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.160
A girl education is not important

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.320
But a boy education

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.320
Is good

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.320
A girl

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.320
If you send a girl to school

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.320
If the girl grown up

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.320
Going to marry, blah, blah, blah

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.320
But now I think now

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.320
Everything changed

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.320
So my education level

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.320
Is just classics

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.320
And I dropped out

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.320
But I'm proud of myself

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.320
That I know

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.320
I can't just read much

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.480
I can read

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.480
I can also stand on my feet

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.480
And do something

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.480
Support myself

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.480
But I'm proud

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.480
That I'm working

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.480
Taking care of myself

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.480
My mother is back in Africa

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.480
I work, I always send

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.480
Money back home to take care of my mother

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.480
So I'm here working

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.480
Supporting them

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.480
So because of that I'm proud

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.480
Of myself

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.640
I'm not like

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.640
Putting my bed into somebody

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.640
That's why

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.640
I'm proud of myself for that

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.640
That's fantastic

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.640
Your English is really great

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.640
It's really good

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.640
I was saying that my English

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.640
Is not that perfect

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.640
No it's very good

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.640
Thank you

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:36.640
I can't speak

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.640
Any other languages

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.800
I can only speak English

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.800
I'm always impressed

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.800
When somebody can speak more than one language

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.800
I think it's

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.800
Really amazing

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.800
My children can speak two languages

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.800
I can't

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.800
They speak Welsh

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.800
And English

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.800
I can't

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.800
I will not say Wales

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.800
In this country

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.800
So I live here now

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.800
But I come from England

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.960
I came to Wales a long time ago

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.960
20 years ago

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.960
To Wales

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.960
No

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.960
30 years ago

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.960
I came to Wales

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.960
To go to university

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.960
But I grew up in England

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.960
But my children were born in Wales

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.960
Grew up speaking Welsh

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.960
That's good

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.960
But I think your English is very good

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.960
I thought maybe

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.960
No it's very good

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.120
Thank you

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.120
That's been really fascinating

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.120
To hear

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.120
Thank you so much for sharing all that
