00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.560
Today is the 23rd of June 2009. My name is John Butler and I'm in the Connors Key

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:19.520
home of my former English teacher Kerry Hughes. Kerry you've kindly agreed to let me document

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.960
today something about your life as a student and a subsequent career both as a flinching

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.440
teacher and then as a worker in the research and education department of a global business.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.400
Kerry let me start by asking you to tell us something of your early schooling and when you

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.720
might first have been aware that language, literature and learning were going to be the

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.480
focus of much of your life. I suppose that I was never aware of that. I mean one goes to school,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.600
I went to an ordinary little church school in Connors Key. It was the one primary school that

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.520
Connors Key had. There was a little infant school and then you went to St Mark's school which was

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.280
a church school. The next other school was Shotton Primary and therefore the local children did not

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.120
walk or catch buses to Shotton Primary. Most of them went to St Mark's and left at 14.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.040
The fellow who came to teach what might have been termed a scholarship class, except that there were

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.800
only four of us who were put in for the entrance examination for the grammar school in that year.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:37.840
So it was four out of what 25 or 30. He detected we had ability and he was determined that he would

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.200
make every effort to get us through the exam. I mean I liked boarding school stories or something

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.880
of that sort and Alice in Wonderland and things like that I was given to read.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.440
We were all taken to the Hippodrome to see David Copperfield, a film version of it, and we had to

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.360
write an essay on David Copperfield and I won the prize and I think it was

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.400
a shilling or two shillings or something like that. But obviously I had been very

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.480
struck by it. You then moved up to what was at the time known as Hardin County School.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.880
Did you get there by an examination process? Was it called in those days the 11 plus?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.880
No it was called a scholarship. You could go in for it at any age so that was why it wasn't called

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:43.040
the 11 plus. And Hardin County School was based on a four-year matriculation course.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:53.920
O levels were later to be 11 plus entry and you did your O levels at 16. Now when I went to the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:02.000
county school age 10 I was going obviously to do my matriculation course which was the equivalent

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:11.680
of O levels in four years and therefore I went into the sixth form at 14 because I had done that

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.800
in four years. This gave you an advantage. You had three years in the sixth form and you therefore

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:26.560
could sit scholarships for other places or you know improve on your results or something like

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.240
that and still only be 17 when you went to university. While still a child going to a

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.120
school quite a long way from your home in Connors Quay did you have to travel there daily and how

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.320
did you do that? Oh yes of course we had a private bus. Richardson's Buckley provided the bus and we

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:53.040
got on it and came home on it. And was that part of the school experience? Yes. Did you feel when

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.960
you first went to Hardin County School that you were entering a place of excellence? Oh I don't

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.800
think you have any judgment as to what is a place of excellence at that time. I mean so long as I

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:14.400
got good marks I really wasn't very bothered. I think that you judge a place after you've been

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.960
through it and you have the opportunity of judging it compared with other places. But was there any

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.760
particular awe that might have been engendered by your new surroundings something that might

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:36.000
have impressed you upon first entering? No because it was all the old buildings. It was not I mean

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.960
places that we found we we talked about later like the new corridor had only just come into

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:51.600
existence and the new hall was relatively new as well. Did your family have to make any sacrifice

00:04:51.600 --> 00:05:00.720
to support your attendance at that school? No because I had I think a boss bursary when your

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:09.520
income when family income was looked at money was given for books or for travel or something like

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.040
that and in my case I had some grant towards the travel which as I record it was something

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:21.920
that throttled today anyway. Did you feel at the time that you had any sort of obligation to

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:31.680
succeed at school or were you self-motivated anyway? Neither I just did what I did my homework

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:40.160
and it generally got good marks and we had examinations at the end of pretty well every term

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:50.640
so you were able to keep track of where you were in the class. I had a cousin who had been top of

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:59.120
the county in the year that we passed for the county school. Her name was Meryl Bailey and

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:08.000
she could always beat me. If I became second in class Meryl was always first. Meryl sadly

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.520
died of peritonitis in our second year in the sixth form otherwise she would have gone on to

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:23.440
great things. Was the study of classics and in particular Latin the norm at schools like

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:29.440
Hardin County School? I should have thought so but I mean it was only available

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:38.560
to a certain number. As I recall it most people would encourage for example to do French

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.680
and the choice was French or Welsh. Only a small minority ever did Welsh and I think they felt

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:52.880
that one had to come from a Welsh background where Welsh would be spoken in the home. In the case of

00:06:52.960 --> 00:07:03.200
the other three languages it was Latin, German, Spanish. You selected one of those. The Spanish

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:12.720
department was less strong and I suspect the Latin department was as well. The German department was

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:18.560
very strong indeed because George Lawson who was head of English was also head of German.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:30.400
Did he give you a little verbal test on your expertise in Latin that was a deciding factor in

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:38.320
his letting you join a class? Oh no, no I had already joined the English class. I decided on my

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:47.920
subjects for higher school certificate and I was doing history, Latin, English and French but

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:57.520
he was rather appalled at the idea of 14 year olds going into the sixth form. He thought and

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:03.200
this I was one of the first to do this but it happened several years afterwards. I mean people

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:09.920
came into the sixth form the following year at exactly the same age and he thought we were too

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:21.520
immature. He was probably right but the incident you mentioned was he talked about

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:31.920
captive Greece taking captor Rome captive and he had a new dictionary of quotations. This was I

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:39.600
think the first Oxford dictionary of quotations or the first edition of it and he hadn't really

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.240
shown much interest in me. I don't think I'd written any good essays or anything like that.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:50.880
Anyway he said you know where is this from and everybody looked a bit blank and I recall that

00:08:50.880 --> 00:09:00.880
actually it was part of our school certificate Latin course included some Horace and it was a

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:07.760
part part of a bit of Horace so I said this and thereafter he took more interest in me because

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:16.240
he realised that I had recalled that but I mean I thought that he in his own way was

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:28.000
the sort of teacher that made you curious. He could plant a little seed and you would follow it up

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:36.400
and that was his great talent. There were two prizes in the sixth form available

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:45.920
to people who did well at A level which were called higher school certificates then and

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:54.960
the Henry Neville Gladstone prize I rather think was available to boys for

00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:02.880
two years out of three and it was available to girls one year out of three. Everybody who was

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:10.480
in the history class in the sixth form was expected to write an essay annually called the

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:17.920
Gladstone essay and this subject was chosen by our history teacher and it would be on some aspect of

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:29.120
of what Victorian history and we submitted our rather lengthy essays and she then

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:36.160
selected the one that was best for a prize and in my third year in the sixth form the prize was

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:45.120
shared with another pupil myself. Apart from that there was another prize for girls only the Helen

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:52.000
Gladstone prize. I did win the Helen Gladstone prize yes £10 and of course it was supposed to

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.440
provide books. Well we had had the war heaven's sake it was not yet over and who was going to

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:05.360
spend £10 on books when they were going to university so it bought a dress didn't it? Well

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:14.240
it bought several dresses. Miss Thomason who was our history teacher and head of history of course

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:22.240
arranged with the authorities at St Daniel's that those of us who were learning history or

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:28.960
taking history in the sixth form should have the privilege of going down to St Daniel's library

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:36.480
to consult books if we needed to but perhaps to do some homework or something of that sort

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:45.440
and it involved a double period that is to say lessons lasting two school lessons and usually

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:51.760
were the last two in an afternoon so in my case it was a Friday afternoon that I used to go down

00:11:51.760 --> 00:12:00.320
there. One didn't go every week it depended what there was on. We were allowed to go into what was

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:10.560
a relatively new wing as I recall it it was a bit like a breeze block structure or something of that

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:19.040
sort an annex of the library I suppose one would have said and I don't recall finding very much

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:28.080
that was terribly useful to me but it certainly was quiet and well it afforded

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:36.960
a studious place to learn. I don't think that I recall ever having seen anybody else in this

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:46.000
particular area on a Friday afternoon. I think that the more used books were elsewhere. I knew

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.920
that it catered for people who were ordained usually. I knew that it was Gladstone's own

00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:01.760
library that he had moved from the castle there. I think that everything else was pretty well

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:11.920
a mystery. I can remember Alec Vidler as warden and seeing him in Hardin in his

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:21.600
grey cloak and looking rather interesting and different but I think that it was a place of

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:29.840
studious refuge. I don't think that I mean for example I had grandparents who lived in

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:35.840
Hardin and an aunt and uncle Meryl's parents who lived in Hardin and I never heard them discuss it.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:43.120
It was just the library. It was there. It had Gladstonean connections and that was that.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:52.880
I am aware only vaguely of the way it has been opened up and I have enjoyed several lunches

00:13:52.880 --> 00:14:01.840
there. I don't think that it's easy to see any other part of it apart from separate days when

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:08.640
you can't go and have a tour of the library just at the drop of a hat as I understand it.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.840
I think that I probably favour some things more than other things that I have heard go on there.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:29.360
As somebody sitting highers in history we had it drummed into us by our history teacher that if

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:36.880
we could quote from Gladstone's speeches this would adorn our history answers and one of the

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:45.840
quotations that I remember was that the Turk needed clearing bag and baggage out of Europe

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:54.160
because they had maltreated the Armenian refugees and it therefore strikes me as odd that now there

00:14:54.160 --> 00:15:01.040
is going to be an Islamist room at the library. I can only imagine that WE is turning over in his

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:11.680
grave. Were you aware at the time of Helen Gladstone's relationship to Hardin County School?

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:19.600
Apart from the fact that she was a daughter of WE as far as I know that was all I knew.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:27.600
Does that suggest that maybe the Gladstone legacy in those times was not being exploited in the way

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.600
that it is today?

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:39.600
I don't know whether such things ought to be exploited. I think that if a family is good enough

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:48.720
to endow a school with prizes I don't think it's necessary to do any excessive publicity or something

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:56.720
of that sort. You get prizes given to schools by a variety of people. I know for example that

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:05.280
there was an Arthur Jones prize and a Florence Garland prize and these were in memory of two

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:13.600
members of staff who had unfortunately died during a summer holiday. And I gather that places like

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:20.880
I gather that places like Hollywood for example sometimes a member of staff can come along and

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:27.840
enjoy teaching there and leave something behind by way of an athletics prize or something like that.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:37.520
When I went to university they were looking I was registering for the course and one of the senior

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:44.080
lecturers who anybody who studied Wordsworth will know his name was Earnshaw and he edited

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:49.680
the favourite edition of Wordsworth. He said oh good school when he saw where I came from.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:17:00.000
I didn't really ever plan to do a degree in English literature. Most courses at universities

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:07.680
are labelled English literature. Mine was not. I selected Aberystwyth because it was English

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:15.680
language and literature and apart at that time from one of the Oxford colleges it was the only

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:28.640
place that was actually teaching Icelandic, Old Norse and the language. So I spent at least half

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:36.400
of my time on studying language as distinct from literature. I went to France for the first time

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:44.160
in my graduation year which was 1948 because we those of us who had a good enough degree

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:53.920
well first class honours degree and a second class top degree were eligible for £37 travelling grant

00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:01.520
and I got that travelling grant and I went to visit my French exchange, French correspondent

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:11.360
and her family had gone to the area of Normandy near Caen for the summer and I went to stay with

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:17.840
them and then Denise and I travelled to Paris because they had a flat in Naye, a very fashionable

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:26.240
suburb of Paris so that was my first trip abroad. Thereafter I suppose that they happened

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:30.160
pretty frequently, I mean on the whole once every year.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:44.080
Yes I did and I afterwards went over I think some of this gear was

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.360
taken onto the continent, I don't know whether I'm right, oh Brussels or somewhere like that and I

00:18:49.360 --> 00:19:01.360
afterwards went to see it there. I don't think that it had the quality or the width of something

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:09.440
like the 1851 exhibition. I mean I know nothing about that first hand but I gather that the 1851

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:18.400
exhibition promoted Britain as an empire etc and was highly ranked among all the exhibitions

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:25.920
in the world whereas I thought that the 1951 exhibition didn't affect us locally and wasn't

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:35.760
of any great interest. I get very annoyed when I hear people talk about life in the 50s being dreary

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:41.680
because I would have said that we were so thankful that the war was over that we found

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:51.920
nothing dreary about being able to go out or have clothes and things like that. I mean it so happened

00:19:51.920 --> 00:20:00.720
that I went to the West Riding of Yorkshire for just two terms and then came home and discovered

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:08.080
that the job at Hardin was going and I had 11 and 8 pence in my bank account and my mother said

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:14.880
wouldn't it be sensible to apply for the job just to get some money. I mean teachers were very badly

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:24.400
paid and it was a means to an end except that I'd always loved school and I knew that it would find

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:31.040
favour with the staff there who taught me because they'd always been nice and kind to me etc

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:41.600
and I just recall well going out with friends, going to quaint ways to dances and things of that

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:49.840
sort. I mean one went to the local cinemas and trips to London and all the rest of it.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:56.480
It wasn't a long career in teaching. I'd been teaching 10 years so that's not a long career

00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:02.400
in teaching really. I was determined to get out of teaching after I had done a fair amount of it and

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:10.800
I did get out of teaching. I mean as soon as firms were offering jobs and I decided when the

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:19.680
opportunity came that I would go into industry yes and I was looking around and I can truthfully say

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:26.640
there were very few opportunities. They were not keen, firms were not keen as they are now,

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:34.560
to accept a graduate whatever the discipline and say well all right we'll use your nouse.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:44.720
I mean my niece who graduated with a degree in German in the what 70s was able to get a job with

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:54.160
ease comparatively not using her German. I went to work for Unilever on the site in Port Sunlight

00:21:54.720 --> 00:22:00.720
there are there is Leaver Brothers obviously but there are about four other companies. Unilever

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:10.640
Research, Unilever Merseyside, Unilever Export, Unilever Limited and I went to research. I realised

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:21.520
swiftly that I really needed to learn some detergent chemistry to do this and I did so.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:29.360
A lot of people fell by the wayside because they didn't want to do this. The particular job that

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:35.760
they had in mind when I went there and when I said I was interested in having a job there

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:43.760
was liaison with their education department in London which involved actually a bit of teaching

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:55.120
inasmuch as they then employed lots of girls who were personal advisors but they had to be given

00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:03.280
correct information about fabrics and fibres and the various detergents that were then available

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:11.440
and they held meetings up and down the country and gave demonstrations to people etc.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:23.280
So I became part and parcel of all this. I for example delivered a lecture on stain removal

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:29.760
to the South of Scotland Electricity Board personnel which was a great change from Shakespeare

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:36.560
but it was very enjoyable just the same because everything was done with

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.720
taste and aplomb. Unilever is a very good company.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:52.000
When the grammar schools closed I was in industry and I was not in any way so pro that I was fighting

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000
for the cause or anything like that. Had I been on the staff of the school I no doubt would have

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:04.800
felt very different about it but I thought that it was being done for all the wrong reasons.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:10.640
Anthony Crossland was the villain of the piece so far as I was concerned and Shirley Williams.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:17.200
I mean I reflect on Shirley Williams and I think of the fact that she was one of the children

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:23.680
evacuated from this country during the war by her mother Vera Britton and therefore when

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:32.080
um she has made a great fuss of as indeed she is it seems to me by a lot of male chairman of panels

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:41.680
I think that she betrayed the cause though I am a great admirer of Margaret Thatcher.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:51.280
I'm afraid she did the same and she now I gather regrets it and I am a rather dismayed that when

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:59.840
people beg the Tory party to be on the side of the grammar schools if they want to have a grammar

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:07.280
school in their neighborhood it is quite clear that David Cameron has said no. On reflection

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:18.240
I do agree with pupils that I have met since who liked their grammar school experience to such an

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:24.480
extent that they were determined to bring their families to areas where grammar schools still

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:32.320
existed. I think that there is too little attention given in the comprehensive school

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:39.840
to the gifted child. We make all sorts of provisions for those with special needs.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:49.280
Well as I see it being gifted is a special need and if there was greater evidence in the school

00:25:50.240 --> 00:26:02.480
itself that gifted children were being given as much help as they could be given I would feel

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:10.640
more optimistic about the future. I would say that when I joined the comprehensive system

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:17.680
a lot of the staff were still grammar school staff. They had taught at Hollywood grammar school

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:25.440
which had a very good reputation and when I retired there were about

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:34.720
half a dozen men probably and four or five women who had been on the grammar school staff

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:44.000
or had themselves been taught at a grammar school. I am sure that the very fact that they have all

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:54.160
retired or left has affected the situation. I don't know how well or how badly. The ethos of the

00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:03.680
grammar school was something that those of us who taught at the grammar school just almost

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:09.680
accidentally imposed. We weren't aware of the fact that we were doing it. It was just that we

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:14.640
treated children in a rather different way from the people who had been secondary modern. Well

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:19.760
it was very obvious in our treatment of the children that's all I can say. There's a very

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:26.560
fond relationship. It always speaks of you with great affection. Yes. Even with huge gaping.

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:33.520
Oh yes yes and I've always had I'm pleased to say that relationship with all pupils. I mean to say

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:40.640
you would have thought that at the comprehensive school I might not have found them so what shall

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:50.400
I say innately attractive to keep up a connection but that was not so. With the sixth forms it is a

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:59.520
different relationship that you have and I'm pleased to say that with boys and girls I've always had

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:09.520
well an ease of relationship that's all about it. I would say that I had very many bright pupils to

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:16.400
teach when I came to comprehensive education. The sixth form was virtually the same. It was full of

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:27.840
people who wanted to go to university or college and they were very equal to finding their way there.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:36.720
Turning to recent concerns for the integrity of people in public life and the political systems

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:41.840
do you think present-day media is rising to the challenges traditionally that were the domain of

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:50.160
the fourth estate? I read the telegraph from cover to cover every day. I think that this

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:57.040
treatment of the expenses by the telegraph has been absolutely brilliant. I not only think that

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:01.600
it was very worthwhile doing but I don't know whether you saw the publication on Saturday

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:07.920
and I think that it has been beautifully done as a piece of what

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.440
well almost a picture post type thing. I think it is brilliant and all the people

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:25.120
responsible deserve congratulations. I like the spectator. I don't always buy it but at the moment

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:33.840
they have sent me five complimentary copies so I'm pleased about that. I am a great listener to

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:44.960
radio and to various programs that I respect like Melvin Bragg in our time and things of that sort.

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:54.320
I do take the trouble to listen to the Westminster Hour on a Sunday night in order to perhaps have

00:29:54.320 --> 00:30:00.160
Caroline Quentin or before her Andrew Raunsley give me some left-wing ideas so that I don't

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:11.520
become too right-wing. I watch Channel 4 news. I do not on the whole watch BBC News. I cannot say

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:20.080
that I approve of the presenters on Channel 4 but I think that on the whole they do a better job of

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:29.120
of handling prejudice and bias better than the BBC does. The Today program is a case in point.

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:36.560
I mean I know what Jim Nocty's politics are and therefore I think he should be taken off the job

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:43.600
as an election comes nearer. I go to the cinema fairly regularly and the theatre fairly regularly.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:48.960
I loathe popular culture and that's it.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:57.200
What are the things in your life for which you might wish the people you taught would remember you by?

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:12.400
I don't know John. I think that introducing them to certain books. When I went to this particular

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:20.400
reunion I had people whose names I didn't remember coming up to me and saying oh I shall never

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:26.720
forget your lessons on Northanger Abbey and when I lost my daughter and this was a very

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:37.520
sad moment I found comfort in literature and all that you had taught us and you realised then that

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:44.560
just as I would claim that George Lawson was my mentor so to a degree I had been theirs.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:53.040
That is a great responsibility that one doesn't imagine one has but I'm the most unambitious

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:59.600
creature you have ever encountered. I have never longed for a car or a house or for that matter a

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:06.640
husband. I have always just been content with the moment.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:20.640
Kerry Hughes thank you for our conversation today. Thank you John.
