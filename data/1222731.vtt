00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The Maccabiah Games, 1977, was probably one of the highlights of my life.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
One to represent your country, an amazing honour.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
To reach that standard was hard work, obviously.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
A lot of training, which I did when I was in college.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I used to train with the Welsh squad and play football and go training twice a week.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
When I was selected, I did trials in Manchester, trials in London.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Once I was then selected, to be part of that group, went out representing the country in that environment,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
my memory is of the opening ceremony.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The opening ceremony was 60,000 people in the Ramat Gan Stadium in Tel Aviv.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And each of the teams, as it is in the Olympics today, would parade around the stadium

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
holding the flag of the country with the team following the flag.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And I remember distinctly now walking around that stadium and hearing my name being shouted from the crowd

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
because one of the guys who was in school with me in Cardiff had emigrated to Israel

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and was in the stadium watching the opening ceremony.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And I wouldn't say I'm in touch with him daily, but I have seen him very recently in the last two years.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
He's been back over to Wales and I reminded him of the story.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And I remember the closing ceremony as well where all the athletes were exchanging mementos.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And we would change uniforms and we would exchange pins.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And I've still got some of the memorabilia somewhere in the house of that event.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
But by far as a sporting achievement, it was the highlight of my sporting career.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Even though I played football in Belgium, that was the European Maccabeeh.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.000
But to be in the World Maccabeeh Games in front of that many people at that sort of event in Israel was the pinnacle.
