00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well, the first memory I have really is of watching the coronation.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I don't remember very much before that, but I do remember watching the coronation.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We'd been looking forward to it for a long time.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
As you say, it was a period of austerity and it seemed a bit exciting.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It was a glimpse of a world that was probably alien to lots of people in an area like this.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And to see the aristocracy in all their glory, although we didn't see the colour then, it was all black and white,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but we could get a good idea of the pomp and the circumstance that surrounded it.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And we became conscious of the fact that we were a nation probably different from other nations.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Not many nations had coronations, but we had one.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So we were proud of that fact and we were interested.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And when we were invited to watch, we all went and sat and had a lovely tea party afterwards.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And then we thought, well, perhaps it might be a good idea to either save up and buy one or to rent one and see how we would go.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And here in this house we debated and we finally decided to venture to rent one.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And there was a bit of a fast-in-combotion putting in aerials and one thing, and my father was fascinated

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
because it was sort of an interest in him. So we had one and then eventually we bought one.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So that by the time we came to the royal wedding, we were well and truly in the swim, as it were,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and we could invite people to come here and watch it. Because by now we had a coloured one and that was important.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
First of all, we'd had a black and white one. But by the time we got to the royal wedding, we'd advanced.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
We'd gone off to colour and that made a difference, a vast difference.
