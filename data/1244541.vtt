What were your first impressions of Di, Chris?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
What made her stand out from other people to you and make her special?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Is it unexplainable?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Yeah, unexplainable.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I can't say anything about her saying it.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What about you Di, what made Chris stand out?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
He was just, you know, friendly, shy but friendly.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Shy but friendly.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And he liked, we seemed to have had a lot in common.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Even saying that he liked Radio 2 when I expected him to like Radio 1.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
That really impressed me.
