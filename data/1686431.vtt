00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
Initially let us say straight away from HDA thank you to Heritage Lottery Wales

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.560
for supporting us and enabling us to do this short series of podcasts about

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:18.960
Tiger Bay, Bute Town. This is part two of our conversation with Peter Phillips

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:28.960
jazz musician and well one of the hearts that actually drives Tiger Bay. One of

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.920
the projects we did I did with HDA Horn Development Association which is Steve

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:46.600
Kyra and Mohammed and and I copied 1700 Siemens identity cards and these are

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:55.160
these are 1921 because yeah conveniently Peter all of the identity cards for

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.160
World War one were destroyed by the government in 1919 the same year we had

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.240
the race riots in the bay strange that and yeah and but after these identity

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:21.320
cards I've got pictures and I and I tell you for about six months I had loads of

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.520
people inquiring you know what it's my so-and-so on now you know whatever people

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.880
from Canada from all over the world and I was sending them a picture from the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.880
eye from the identity card of their grandfather some great-grandfathers and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.240
the thing about them which people everyone who said looked at everyone who

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.680
looked at them said took their breath away in these cards they were always

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.840
smart in these pictures there was no reason they needed to dress up for that

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.880
picture it was just an identity thing for the ship

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.280
Oh what do you mean every every Friday night a Saturday night every man in the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.960
bay had a trilbiathlon and it's tight a thicky book patent shoes everybody was

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.560
shocked and that's the way you were brought up everybody was shocked you

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.320
said you said you was a counselor only Southampton what part of Southampton were you?

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.320
St Mary's

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.320
St Mary's yeah yeah

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.320
for about three months I lived in Amble

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.560
ah right yeah yeah but that that was before the nothing not with the bridge

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.440
before he went across on the ferry yeah yeah

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.920
to Amble yes it's a it's a small world they did a program the other month here

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:50.080
about black miners yeah black men have been all over the world yeah and I gotta say I watched

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:58.800
that program that was the um Cardiff footballer yeah yeah yeah and I thought and that's that's who

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:06.240
you can come up with my grand my granddad was a miner yeah I thought he was poor because I knew

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:16.720
quite a few men who were miners it's like after the um the west indians had settled in Cardiff

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.040
yeah they were all lumberjacks up in Scotland but it but you know Peter it's like the guys who

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.880
went through the first world war on the ships like my granddad did my man my nan said to him

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.880
you ain't going you ain't going again you ain't going to war it on the ships during war again

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.840
so second world war they everybody moved up to Geckley Gare and they were working on the mines

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.920
working on the mines so loads loads of black Caribbean particularly merchant seamen

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.880
were up the valleys so correct did not be able to come up with any I just thought with two or three

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.880
I thought that was poor that was like a lack of asking people you you know because you've done

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.160
yourself if you're going to do something do it with a good research I don't bother at all

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:14.240
yeah that's my feeling if you're going to do it at least what I'm interested in is invisible history

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:21.440
you know what exactly what I mean and that's that's our history it's invisible it's inconvenient

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:29.440
so to just come up with two or three that's feeding the people who don't really want to know

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:37.200
about us well yeah because as you see I mean I was I was amazed because he didn't go far

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.920
he didn't go far he didn't go down he didn't go down the Swansea valley I mean I'm now I'm

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:49.520
now living I'm now living in my steg you know oh yeah bridge M way yeah and I walked up the road

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:57.680
guy there who's really nice guy in my steg in the Kyra pit which he would have been up the road from

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:05.600
me for Jamaicans or former merchant seaman he said and that's he said he said I watched that

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.760
program and I thought what have you done you you're not even asked anybody you ask any miner in the

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:19.040
valleys over 60 or over 70 they'll name two or three guys they knew exactly exactly like that

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:28.160
and they knew and liked not just you know it's not about you know racism whatever else

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:36.800
people they knew and liked but you see as I said to you he never even went down the Swansea valley

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.840
to check out people and you've got to go if you're going to make a program like that and he's not

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:50.080
somebody who's not known he's a well-known player he's a well-known reporter the self of his echo

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.920
I just thought he was poor I was kept on saying to myself he haven't asked so and so and he

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.480
haven't asked this person yeah and I thought well it's not for me to tell him what to go and ask

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:07.280
I mean that that's what strikes me it was lazy it was lazy the idea is good and it needs doing

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:14.480
it in my generation in the 50s and 60s you've never you've never had no blacks working on the

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.560
on the dock on the wet dock you had no blacks working there it was family after family was all

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:27.280
white yeah as I say to you when when you when you think about they talk about this black lives matter

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:35.680
fewer discrimination they wouldn't allow you in the ducks conservative club they wouldn't allow you

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.080
in green town conservative club and one of the sweetest stories I ever heard

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:48.480
was a colored gentleman that I knew personally who went to the docks conservative club in other

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:57.040
street and they said he wasn't allowed he wasn't welcome to when he pulled out his affiliation card

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.960
of being a member in rummy conservative club the quiet went the club went quiet

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:10.640
and he said no put me out he didn't put him out but these are people that's what I say to you

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:17.040
you always you're the same old cliche oh my best friend is so soft yeah and I used to say to him

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.640
you wouldn't like him marrying your daughter and they used to go quiet

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:28.400
they go quiet tell it like it is it's true but you you mentioned the place that I probably enjoyed

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:35.200
I used to go to regular was my stay yeah because my stay got a nice little nice little nightclub

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:42.080
there four sevens it was a regular place to go and uh it was well we always I played with we are

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.720
lower valleys and we was always made welcome because as you said there was black miners up

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:54.000
there were you playing for the kayaks then peter yep yep they yeah there is no way you go in the

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.280
valleys on any rugby any rugby club whether you know the major ones all the small ones

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:09.680
you mentioned the kayaks and all of them their faces light up and they say hardest game I ever

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:20.480
played but the best night I ever had yeah and the best thing about it was one of the reason

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:27.840
the main reasons that we played up the valleys or regular was because we could go into the

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:33.120
pitted bars and have a good shower instead of dragging that old big tumble bath out in your

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:38.880
own house to buy in the cows and that was that was the main reason I was oh there's lovely and

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:45.200
a nice shower you haven't got to drag that big bath out and fill it with hot water and then empty it

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:52.400
so that's why and as I said I still got friends from all over the valleys they sent Christmas

00:08:52.400 --> 00:09:00.240
cards to and from play rugby in the 50s and 60s and you see this is this is the thing we youngsters

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:06.800
today they don't keep their relationships today no they are it seems to me there's a there's a

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.840
chip on the shoulders instead of getting out to meet the people well you know you know you take

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:18.000
you take the work that that Kyra is doing with with the community and give no parcels

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.640
he shouldn't be on his own there should be everybody you could drive and come

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:29.040
motorist he'd go in and say Kyra I'm available I'm available I'm available yeah but that's not there

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:37.360
no more it's gone it's gone years ago he'd be intoxicated with cash he'd say no I got plenty

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:42.400
I got plenty I got plenty because everybody would know it's us I've been letting get on with it

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:49.360
but it's also but it's also Peter years ago say you were 20 years old and you walk into your

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:54.880
into your house you know your mum and dad's house and your mum or your dad would turn around and go

00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:01.600
are you helping them with the food stuff do you know what I mean it wouldn't be just you it would

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:10.640
be the expectation from family that you make you do your shift you make your contribution

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:19.120
yeah well you go as I as I told you in in the far east and late 40s and 50s all the children

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:27.200
my age boys and girls we'd all be out giving out these leaflets for galang around the streets

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:32.800
and and you just did it because your parents would say right tonight when you come to school

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:39.680
I'm gonna see you do this you do that and then I mean I didn't know what she meant she used to say

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.720
oh I'm going to the city off of the cult I never knew what she's talking about yeah that's how

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:50.160
they were with the labor party at the time you know of elections and stuff yeah but no what you

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:56.400
what you just said is correct you were not to be told you would go and ask yeah can you do something

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:03.040
you know I mean they say about looking out for neighbors we did that all through the 40s and 50s

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:11.920
check on Mrs. So-so check I remember getting sent to Lermont's a shopping town and getting the penny

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:17.440
I dare not tell my brother I had the penny because she said I was being rude I said oh I did the job

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.960
man you're not gonna complain I said I'm a miserable lady give me a penny

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:28.560
I didn't want to whack across the head you know you shouldn't you shouldn't be taking money for it

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:34.160
you're supposed to be you know I know exactly what you're talking about if you don't take it

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.080
you're doing wrong again for you I know that's it but what you're saying what you're saying is

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:44.800
right I mean you could you could go down to the party and you meet people who knew your parents

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:52.160
and you were part of the family yeah you know how many times do you know gosh just growing up

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:58.640
I'd get up in the morning going to school and there'd be three or four men that's crashed down

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:03.920
who've come down from Jardy land and was going to join the ship and my brother was a cook on

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:08.400
but they stayed there because the ship hadn't come in yet and that was that was part of it

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:15.840
yeah you know you never said right it's seven and six for bed and breakfast everybody at

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:23.920
everybody and everybody went to see you know it and the thing and the thing was Peter as you know

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:30.160
as my as my nan used to say you know it's an old saying but what goes around comes around yeah

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:36.160
but no one would want you to make you feel like you were having a hard time

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:45.120
exactly exactly it's like a few years ago it's it's gone now that they you you must have known

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:51.680
about it the mons steward pub yeah of course right well on the corner where the lights is obviously

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:59.840
the bank now there was a friend of mine on the corner there and I was going I had my son

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:07.360
with me in a car I think it was about 11 so I stopped the car and I said turn the window down

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:12.720
and I called his friend the man I said to my son give him this just give it to him so I give him a

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:20.720
fiber I give it to him and we drove up we should we could do that for that I said but you see that

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:28.160
corner there it's called penniless point I said and that friend of mine there he comes over from

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:34.400
sea he looks for grammy to make sure that I don't need anything and that was a few drinks

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:40.240
for the Chinese for the meal I said so I'm just reciprocating I said when you see somebody there

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:45.840
that you know he's either waiting for the ship or waiting for work I said so that fiber can take

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:52.400
him in get himself a pack of bags in the punch yeah oh he said oh but you see that's all gone

00:13:53.280 --> 00:14:01.440
no ship in the moon there's no seaman it's it's hard to think of what was when you see all them

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:07.280
as you would remember all them ships waiting in barry road to come into caradoc walk and walk

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:14.640
across we can walk across barry dock we used to walk across barry dock on ships yeah yeah

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.760
with someone trying to chase us off the boats

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:29.280
every time I talk to somebody like you about penny and it brings all the sweet memories I had

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:36.320
in that chain locker if you I'll tell you what I spoke to a guy after I did another thing

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:45.440
I spoke to a guy whose granddad had been to see this guy is in South Africa right and and he you

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:52.320
know white guy is in South Africa and he said to me you're doing research he said and I wasn't I

00:14:52.320 --> 00:15:01.040
was doing you know this kind of thing and I said yeah and he said my granddad said and I didn't I

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:07.120
don't understand it my granddad said if you haven't been thrown out the chain locker you

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:17.440
haven't been to see and I had to explain it to him I said he's right it's a rite of passage

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:23.680
people arrive from all over the world they act to be and they almost begged to be thrown out

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:30.000
you know he tried to kill thompson street but you can't you can't kill memories you can't you can't

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:36.400
you can't everybody everybody in Wales knows bute street in the dark yes no matter where you go

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:44.320
that's right it's no and and the other thing about as I say to you is that when they come down the

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:51.520
bay now and they think it's marvelous it's marvelous they haven't seen the bay they they haven't seen

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:59.280
the bay and it's sad because they come down here and what they don't realize is that the bay was a

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:04.720
flush area when you you and you go look at them buildings down by the pier right beautiful yeah

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:12.960
beautiful buildings and and even where you was brought up with up in barry barry was a lovely

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:19.440
a thriving place thompson street I can remember all the old pictures and everything else thompson

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:30.000
street was like the nearest example is pictures of san francisco in the gold boom you know what I

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.520
mean they might have been wooden houses but they was high and they was splendid and then they just

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:44.240
cut them down yeah I beat the san francisco yeah but I just said to you earlier on in a conversation

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:51.200
if if they would have done for him always is in louton square yeah you'd have been looking like

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:57.200
nothing else they were beautiful houses with the railings around it was beautiful that's exactly

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:04.480
the example that comes to mind repeat not in ill or islint in or stoke newington yeah those

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:12.320
altis are now selling for three four million and the other thing about it see you nor I nor Kyra

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:19.360
never had a chance to buy property because we never had the money so you you you see that's

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:26.000
how outsiders got to come and do things but I've always said it them houses in louton square

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000
especially the ones opposite the church they could have been made in the luxury flats

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:39.840
philis philis keeps at the back where the lane is and it could have been luxurious but get them
