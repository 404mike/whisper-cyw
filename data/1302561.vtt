00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.760
What, when my heart, and man with sorrow, I know not what I am saying, nor what I am

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:51.760
doing, yet I must face it, courage my heart, the power of the man, the power of the jester,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.760
the power of the man, the power of the jester,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:18.760
The people pay thee, and wonder if you know,

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:28.760
who hark, when thy columbine hath strobe,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:42.760
The heart's in error, and the world will cry, bravo!

00:01:43.760 --> 00:02:07.760
For I will after thy tears and thy sorrow, sing and be merry, playing thy tarpaulin,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:25.760
and the world will cry, bravo!

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:46.760
For I will after thy tears and thy sorrow, sing and be merry, playing thy tarpaulin, and the world will cry, bravo!
