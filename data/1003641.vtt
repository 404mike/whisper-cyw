00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Not bad, starting to get warmed up.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.780
I shouldn't use the same excuse as Hugh, but I have a cold, but I got mine first, Hugh.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.780
Ha ha ha.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.680
So,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.500
so I'm trying to save enough voice to talk but not hold back too much on the singing.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.080
Now we've got a special treat. Those of you who were here last year will remember

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.920
the children singing. They're back by

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.840
overwhelming

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.760
demand and

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.440
Murray Wingate

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.440
has worked very hard

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.800
to teach them a new song this year. Murray has very fond memories of singing

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.200
when she was a child.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.180
I'm very glad that she's keeping the tradition of the children singing alive and well here in Seattle. Murray Wingate.
