00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120
My name's Jewel Willie and today is the 6th of June 2019 and I'm here with Mrs Elizabeth

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.320
Lewis at her home in Rheydar. Elizabeth, can we start first of all with your early life,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.320
where you were born, where you grew up?

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.320
Oh, I'm close to 50 now.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.320
Yeah.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.320
Don't do a come on back.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.320
No, that's all right. Yeah, just talk. That's fine, yes.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.640
You know, you came from Liverpool, I believe.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.640
I was born in Liverpool. I was there until I was eight when the war broke out, removed from there.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.640
So you basically came as an evacuee, did you? Was that the term they used?

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.640
Yes, that's right.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.640
To come to Mid Wales, right? Where exactly in Mid Wales did you come to?

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.640
Well, my twin and I came to Aberlebenny, which is a village on the side of my country.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.960
To people my parents knew. Everyone had to take refugees anyway.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.960
So that was a big house and they were very important people in the military.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.960
And my other sisters, they were twins, went to a small holding near Clwyd o' Gwydarn,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.960
called the Dollars. And they were there with three old aunts, very quaint old aunts.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.280
They wore clogs and long black skirts and they were very old, very ancient.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.280
But they loved it there.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.280
Well, that would have been quite enough rooting, but what a lovely place.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.280
We were all split up.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.280
That's a bit unfortunate, I suppose.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.280
And my brother up in Bangor with his school.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.280
Right. But you all came to very rural settings then, totally different from Liverpool, I'm sure.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.600
Absolutely, yes.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.600
No bathroom, no water outside, no water in.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.600
It was quite different. I actually liked to get the sticks and things for the fire to boil the kettle sort of thing.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.600
And a little oil lamp, a little oil stove.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.600
I remember something about that.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.600
But not like today with the electric.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.600
People today just wouldn't recognise places like that.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.920
I'd like to go and see it now, see what it's like.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.920
I'm sure you will. I hope you have the opportunity.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:28.920
Right, so you were living in mid Wales and I believe at some point in your life you trained as a nurse.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.920
Did you go back to Liverpool to do that?

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.920
Yes, I did. I was born in Birmingham, Liverpool.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.920
Back there before, yes.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.240
Back to Liverpool.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:47.240
I certainly remember my own mother meeting you in the orthopaedic hospital in Gubowin in the very early 50s.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.240
Yes, I remember that.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.240
I was a very little girl there but Mum did tell me about that.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.240
Yes.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.240
So how, if I can ask, how did you come to marry Alan?

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.240
How did you come to meet him?

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.240
He was a blind date.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.560
And I went on this Sunday afternoon to both my twin and her boyfriend and Nana.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.560
It was friendly with him.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.560
That's where we met.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.560
That's where we met a bit.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.560
Indeed.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.560
What a lovely memory.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.560
That blind date was obviously meant to be, wasn't it?

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.560
Especially in a lovely place like both.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.560
You certainly came to the best part of the world, didn't you?

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.560
I think so.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.560
For your early years and your early years of knowing Alan, of course.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.560
Fine.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.880
So when you decided to get married then, farming life wasn't really new to you at all.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.880
You'd had quite a bit of experience.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.880
And small holding.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.880
Yes, we got used to the animals.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.880
We could milk and do all sorts of things.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.880
Right, so it wasn't just a big shock, having grown into farming life.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.880
And of course they had men.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.880
The women didn't really have to go out on the park to do anything like that.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.200
Today, women all go out on their wives to help their husbands.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.200
It seems that way, yes.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.200
Do you have any special memories of farming in Kevin Kaido as you were living then?

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.200
Nothing that stands out.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.200
It was just everyday things that we had to do.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.200
We had to separate it.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.200
We always milked.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.200
We never bought any milk until we went to live in town.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.520
We used to milk and separate it and make butter, churn and things.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.520
The wives today all go out to work, don't they?

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.520
They seem to, yes.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.520
And then you haven't got time to do your own work, never mind go out there with no electric or anything.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.520
That's so hard to believe, isn't it? No electric.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.520
We take these things for granted, don't we?

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.520
Yes.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.520
Right, what about significant events in Raerder?

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.520
Is there anything you remember?

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.520
I remember Wilfred Pickles coming here.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.520
He came to the railway station, am I right?

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.520
Yes.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.520
I still remember something like that.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:08.520
Otherwise just the usual things, the sheep dog trials and the carnival and all sorts of things that went on, didn't they?

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.520
Yes, and it's still going on.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.520
And it's still going on, that's correct, yes.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.520
Important events in the calendar of Raerder.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.520
So you brought your family up in Kevin Kaido, just on the outskirts of Raerder.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.840
What a lovely place to bring up children.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.840
Kaido, Kevin Kaido, now Kevin we know means a ridge or a back.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.840
Kaido, can you tell me a bit about Kaido?

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.840
I think Kaido was a saint, Kaido, up in North Wales.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.840
And it's a tomb rest in one of the fields.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.840
So I don't know if anybody buried in it or not.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.840
Well, very, very probably, yes.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:53.160
We have to get our landscape history group to find out more and more about that.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:59.160
And I understand that part of the farm was an archway from Abbey Comheer.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.160
Yes, I think that's the tomb.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.160
Yes, yes.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.160
And Kevin Kaido was also known as Kevin Kaido Hall, wasn't it?

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.160
Yes, it was.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.160
Yes.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.160
All right, well a lovely life moving from Liverpool to mid Wales.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.160
What better place to move to?

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.480
I remember being very excited when we had hens and that was to chase them and do all

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.480
sorts of things.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.480
We were sort of confined in Liverpool to do things weren't we?

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.480
Yes, totally a different type of life I would imagine.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.480
Yes.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.480
Well thank you very much for your time and sharing your memories and your experiences

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.480
and wish you all the best in the future.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.480
Thank you very much.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.480
Thank you, Jill.
