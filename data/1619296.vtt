WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
Again, I was now president now and we had a bill that came.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.640
There were two things.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.280
A, we had increasing maintenance costs.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.280
This is a brand of throat.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.960
A brand of throat, yeah.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.580
And also the whole place needed rewiring and other things doing.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.240
And it was costed out at quite a few hundred pounds.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.880
We had the 400,000 which we could have paid for but the 400,000 was giving us interest,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.880
etc.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.760
So then we had a guy came, I can't remember his name now, with an offer that he would

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.600
build us a new synagogue if he could buy the property.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.480
And I did a deal with him that it would be a straight swap.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.720
You get permission to build a synagogue.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.600
You get permission to knock this synagogue down.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.480
And you build us a synagogue so that when you knock down this one, or going to knock

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.160
it down, the following week we can move into the other one.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.520
So there was no stop in services.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.520
Continuity.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.280
And that's the word, yeah.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.880
And here the builder agreed to this but of course the members of the community, significant

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.320
now, quite a number, objected.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.260
Now by then the community in Pennyland was decreasing.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.980
If you knew it, it had a magnificent, the Sherman Hall was wonderful.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.660
It was one of the best halls I've ever been to, attached to a synagogue.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:35.080
That would take, you could have a function for about 200 people with ease in the Sherman

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.080
Hall.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.900
But the synagogue, which would take about 500 people I suppose, maybe more, they're

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:50.180
getting about 20 people on a Saturday and about 20, maybe 30 in total.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.980
So, you know, it was just about running.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:03.220
So I decided in my wisdom that if they could get a purpose-built, smaller synagogue for

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.940
the community as the size is run, you see now we've become too big for the community

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.940
now, we wouldn't have the upkeep.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.820
It would be under guarantee.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.980
And also the other thing is, in order to get a rabbi to come to Cardiff, you have to have

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.780
a ritual bath called a mikvah.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.920
And I thought, well, we can build a mikvah in the shul.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.140
We built one in the shul for one Pennyland for the rabbi.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.300
I thought, well, this time we could do it from scratch and have it integrated beautifully.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.020
So I did the deal with the builder and took it to there that he should knock one down,

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.180
build the other one, build a mikvah, also organize that we could sell kosher food there

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.940
because now all the kosher shops in Cardiff had closed and we made an organization for

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.740
Also, we wanted a room before burial, you know, bodies where the bodies are kept and

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.380
prepared for burial.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.140
That could all be on one site.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.280
And I got that through the council.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.540
So the next thing was to get an architect to do it, which I did.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.660
A fellow gave me a book as a present from him, which he'd written.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.900
But he was a shul architect.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.540
He designed and that synagogue they got now won a prize, you know, when it was built as

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.660
the best religious building built in 2002 or something like that.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.740
And he arranged it that there should be, if you go there, no windows.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.620
There's just, have you been in there?

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.300
You probably didn't notice, but there are no windows.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.580
There's an atrium in the middle.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:40.140
But those along the side, they are from the old synagogue, the windows, they're in a case

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.140
and they're lit.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.100
There's lamps behind them.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.100
So they're lit up.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.700
But of course, one of the main people's objections to building the new synagogue is what about

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.340
our stained glass windows?

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.480
And I said, but what about the community?

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.620
You can't have a community with stained glass windows.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.860
You've got to have a decent synagogue where you could go and pray and not feel that you're

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.300
in a mausoleum, which is so big.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.940
See, and when that's so, I used to go, I came up to London, had meetings with the architect.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.260
And we had arranged meetings with the builder and the architect down here.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:26.140
And I had to do all that on my own because everyone else was either not keen or too busy.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:33.220
But even then, having done the deal, people then said, he's making too much money because

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.340
he's having property.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.260
He's going to set build houses.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.140
He's going to build houses that cost so many hundreds of thousands.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.540
And he's going to make hundreds of thousands of pounds.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.740
And we're just going to have a little synagogue.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.620
And I got it through on a casting vote.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.340
And now, of course, they all say, it's wonderful.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.340
Yeah.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.260
That's how, but there we are.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.660
Now you know the story of the synagogue.
