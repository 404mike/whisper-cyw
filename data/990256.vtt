WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
After my last performance, the people came up to me and said,

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.500
my God, what a fine job you did.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.500
I determined, OK, I'd come up here and do a disaster,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.500
so I'd never have to do it again.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.500
Actually, the background for this is one of the fellows who was going to come down

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.500
was David Mason, who played Captain Cat a few years ago.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.000
David was going to come down, and a few of you have been joining him.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
However, he's involved in the World Curbine Championship,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
which was actually the last one.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
David's holding up the bar.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.500
However, before I proceed and before you throw me out,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.000
I must tell you something.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We've had gmandas in Vancouver, we've had Nasser Lanz in Vancouver.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.500
I want to tell you something.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.500
We've never had Nasser Lanz like this.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.500
We have.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.500
What? Have they told the truth?

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.500
Another thing that struck me tonight, I was desperately searching

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.500
to pay for my board, I'd said to Bob, OK, I'll do something.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
That's when I started thinking of this wanglish stuff.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I thought I'd cut the teal.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
To be very frank, I much prefer this thing.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
We had it in David's basic, that's what it was in David's day, dinner

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
on February 28th at the Vancouver UBC Golf Course.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.500
There were over 200 people there.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.500
We all said it was a very good Sandinista day dinner.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.500
The extraordinary thing is in Vancouver at the moment,

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.500
very posh, very British Consul General, he's Welsh.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.500
He's from Hubert.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:13.500
The good fellow, he came to the Sandinista day dinner.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.500
You could see the boy carrying them away.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
He gave the toast well.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
At the end of the evening he was singing to us and reading us.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
It's quite amusing to see the stiff upper lip, but you might see mellow.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I'm going to create this disaster, which I told you about.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
By doing this, I'm indebted to John Edwards.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
It's a little wimpy actually. Please tell me if you've done nothing.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.500
It's a tale as it would be told in Wenglish.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.500
Again, I must remind you, half of Wales, the population of Wales,

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.500
doesn't have much Welsh culture at all.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:05.500
This is how a tale would have been told in Wenglish.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.500
If I'm going to create a disaster, then I want you to be a part of it.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
In this tale, in Wales, they love to make exclamations.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
When you do something, they go, well, well, well.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Now, good people, I'm going to put a cap on you.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
When I raise my cap, you've got to say, well, well, well.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000
There's also a part in it where when I raise this to my eyes,

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.500
you've got to go, oh.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.500
Now, one of the aspects of Wenglish is,

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.500
they drop their H's, or H's if you say it right.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.500
They drop their H's.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.500
So, in my narration, and I'm totally indebted to John Edwards,

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.500
not totally, sorry, put some stuff in there.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.500
In my narration, in the towns of this tale,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I'm going to have to try and remember to drop me H's.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Now, if you can catch me not having dropped an H,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
then I see here, from my pocket money,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I've got one beer ticket left, right, even though.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
But there's also a catch, you see.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
If I catch you not going, well, well, well,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
then I get a beer of you, right?

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.500
It's a very, what much we better practice before we go.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:46.500
You've got to put a feeling into, well, well, well.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.500
And then we're good to go.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.500
This is a tale, I've seen, I've got a pint of you,

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.500
I've been losing this beer ticket straight away,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
oh, thank you, thank you.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Very sad tale this, of Llywelyn and Gellert.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
You've all heard the story of Llywelyn,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Prince of Wales, haven't you?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
But you'll remember, he lived many years ago, he did,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
when we had our own Prince of Wales,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
not one of those from our England wave.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.500
Well, well, well.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.500
No, no, no, no folks, you've got it right.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.500
Well, well, well.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.500
I'll have to do that again, try.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.500
Well, well, well.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.500
You'll come out.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.500
This is the story of Llywelyn and his beautiful dog Gellert.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.500
And I've got to warn you, it's a hell of a sad story.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.500
Oh.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So, have your Anki ready in case.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Llywelyn had been given Gellert back by his father-in-law,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
King John of England.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Well, well.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Great dog he was, by all accounts.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
A real Bremmer, do they do say.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Llywelyn had taken a real fancy to him.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Nobody could touch him when there was an Anton in the woods,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and mountains around was Llywelyn and his castle.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Like a winky he was, fearless he was, man.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.500
It isn't, but he was like a lamb around the house.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.500
Real gentle he was, what I tell you.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.500
You could do anything with him.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.000
You could, must have been a real smasher.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
The kind you don't see every day, is it?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Well, well, well.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
This particular day, when there was all set

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
to go out for a day's hunting,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
the huntsman blew his horn, took all the owls together,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and all the others came running out right off.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
But will you credit it, there was no sign of Gellert.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Well, well, well.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Oy, oy, must be something up, said the prince.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Must be something up.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
But we can't hang around here for any longer,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
because it looks like we'll come under rain.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Fair play.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
You would see him when they, to get back from the hunt.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
They didn't have much luck on that hunt that day.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Who got it? You did?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Sorry, the only one I got.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Got any more money, love?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
They didn't have much luck on the hunt that day.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
It was obviously going to have done with Gellert back at that hunt.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Oh, my God.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
They didn't seem to be much shape to do anything without him.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Now, well, he was down in the dumps proper

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
when they all got home from a bit of grub.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
What a real second he had with hunting that day.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Well, well, well.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
As the prince jumped down from his horse,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
out came Gellert to meet him.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Master wagged his tail back and forth, back and forth.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Back and forth.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Gellert came out to meet him, wagging his tail back and forth, back and forth.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Jumping up and down, he was all over the moon.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
He was thrilled to bet to get his master home to his captor's house.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Oi! Good boy!

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Yeah, boy, such a well-in. Yeah, boy.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
But when he bent down to stroke the dog

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
and make a bit of fuss about him like it shook him rigid,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
the owens' jaws and fangs were all dripping with blood

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
and a real sight for so eyes he looked.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
The prince, I can tell you, spoke sharp to the dog.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Worried sick he was now about his little toot of a baby's son, see,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
because he used to leave Gellert in charge of the little toot, now and again, off and on.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
He rushed up the stairs, taking two and three by the time to find his little boy,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
and he was flabbergasted to see the walls and floor covered with blood.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Dear Maury said, had everybody looked, it was shanty bang,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
blood to be had all over the place, and as he rushed frantic from moon to moon,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
his dad was in his boots, because he couldn't find hide nor air of his son.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
He shouted and he shouted for all he was worth, but Maury answered.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
On he went, shouted and bawling and getting more work up all the time,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
as he went rushing about the whole place,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
and an eye low for his buck and back, he didn't know which way to turn,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
really, worked himself up into a real prasmy head.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And at last he found his baby's cot, all turned over on his side, all skewed over it was,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000
but no sign of the boy, and the whole place was in hell of a mess.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Then, a well-dead and sore killer, standing by his side, fair play,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:06.000
the fearful owned and left his master for a minute, like a shadow in a beak.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:14.000
You've owned a bell, he said, you've owned a bell, you've killed my son, he said.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:21.000
There was me thinking I could trust you, pumping mad he was, pumping mad he was.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000
By then, pumping mad he was, by then he had to have his revenge.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:35.000
He pulled out his sword and he pushed it right down into poor old Gillard's eye.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
You should have seen him, you should have seen the look in Gillard's eye.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
You should have heard him howl.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
You should have seen him sank down and die.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000
What with all the palaver, with Gillard whining and whining and whining and dying.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
He died and Llewellyn shouting fit to burst.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000
It's not surprising that when all was over, the prince could hear another sound now.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Faint it was, but enough for him to hear it tidy.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
It was obvious that the little toot was crying.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
In two shapes, Llewellyn was over the other side of the room,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:43.000
and there he found his baby son safe and sound, with a scratch on his bottom, a mark on his clothes.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And underneath the couch was lying there was a big, huge, huge wolf.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
You could tell he hadn't been dead that long.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Now of course, Llewellyn could see what had happened.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000
It dawned on him like he could see how Gillard had got himself covered with blood.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Fighting and killing the wolf to stop him getting at the little one.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Hero you are, hero.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Not a rogue, Llewellyn had thought.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
The prince was in hell of a state.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
He was in hell of a state.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
And you can imagine, you could see how hasty he had been,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
and how he had gone and killed poor Gillard when he was down doing his job tidy,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and protecting his son from harm.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
But there was no use carrying on aching and tucking,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
and saying, pray, old Gillard.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
If only I'd stopped to think a minute, I'd kill the finest dog I've ever had.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
The wicked deed had been done,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
and there was nothing you could do now to put things right for poor old Gillard.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
So Llewellyn was sorry in his heart now,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and he had a great big grave made for Gillard,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
and they got to put up a monument over it,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
and there he hung his hunting horn and his spear to show them how sorry he was for what he'd done.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
If you're ever up in that part of Wales,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
you'd better be ready to be in the woods,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
and you'd better be ready to be in the woods.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
If you're ever up in that part of Wales,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
have a look for a little place called Beard Gillard.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
That's where you will find where Gillard is buried,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
because that's what it means in Welsh.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Beard Gillard, Gillard's grave.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And by the way, if I can tell you one of my wanglish,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
as with all lovely tales from Wales, there's a moral to it,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
and the moral to this one is,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
if you find yourself in a bloody mess,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
don't take a stab at cleaning it up.
