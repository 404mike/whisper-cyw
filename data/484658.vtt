This is Katherine McShane interviewing Guy Harper for the Swicker Cardiff Carnival 25th

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:17.320
Anniversary Project. The date is the 12th of November 2014 and we're here in Penilan

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.520
in Cardiff and Guy for the recording. Could you spell your name for me please?

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:32.920
G for gorilla, U for an umbrella and Y for yacht. And your second name? John or Harper.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:41.800
Yeah Harper. Sorry, H-A-R-P-E-R. Lovely. So can you remember how you got involved in

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:49.320
carnival in the first place? Yeah I got dragged along. I was doing some voluntary work for

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.200
City Centre Youth Project and some people I'd met there. I think it was a young lady called Karen

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:03.400
and a chap called Steph and a young lady called Jane dragged me along. They said to come along

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:10.640
to this... well I think they'd been before. They said, oh it's carnival's on, you've got to come

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:18.840
along. So I went along and there's lots of dremming and I was quite interested in music anyway.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:27.840
So they were doing lots of sort of, I don't know, the equivalent of like samba drumming.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.040
I'm not that knowledgeable so I don't know what particular style it was but I just wanted to do

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:42.080
a bit of drumming and there were lots of people drumming in a big space and I thought yeah you

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.720
know I like this and then they started making costumes and stuff. So I got involved and then

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:57.720
carried on going for a few consecutive years. Can you remember which period that was?

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:08.120
What do you mean which period? In terms of years. Well as we were saying earlier, I seem to think it would have been

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:16.960
about 92, 93 until for about probably for about five or six years probably but it's going back

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:24.200
a long time and I can't really... I couldn't be definite about that. I think it would have been

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:32.520
about 92, 93 I would have put my head around the door there and then I would have carried on going

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:46.000
probably until about 90s. I'm trying to think. I'm trying to think, did Fred ever go?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.680
Or did I ever go well after Fred was born? I don't know. I can't remember. It would have been...

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:02.280
I would have carried on going until at least 96 I think. Okay and what was it that sort of kept you

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.600
being involved and interested? I just like the energy of it. The sort of drumming and then later

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.800
I got involved with the stoke walking and it was just... I quite like the atmosphere of the sort of

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.560
a lot of people getting together for a bit you know just sort of for a parade you know and

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:27.000
sort of and to make a lot of noise and to dress up and sort of just generally... well just generally sort of

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:36.520
yeah giving a lot of people all together in a nice big space with you know sort of contributing

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:45.000
to a parade. I just like that. I really like that. Can you remember particular costumes that you

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.880
created or? I can remember doing the one that when the one year

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.280
I remember making a big horn.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.640
That was about it must have been about four foot long.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.920
Right. I kept that on my how I've done now that I didn't break my neck with that I don't know.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:12.920
And then another year some there was some sort of Egyptian. I can't remember what but I remember

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.960
it was Egyptian like ancient Egyptian you know sort of like Pharaoh sort of

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.920
sort of Tutankhamun type Egyptian and then there was that karmageddon on you

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.440
where we all dressed up as cardboard wrappers with sort of cardboard baseball bats caps and stuff.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:39.560
All right. Carbons shorts and cardboard vest. Nice. That was on stilts.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:47.480
And that's I can't remember much else really as to what I was wearing.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.760
Now I can't remember what I can't remember the individual costumes.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.400
Or the themes. Can you remember sort of any of the themes? There was that karmageddon yeah there was

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.800
um the themes crumbs you're really taxing my memory

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:18.520
there was yeah the karmageddon year seems to be overpowering my mind that's all

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.120
that's the only one I can think of at the moment. That's fine. What was your experience of the

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:30.120
carnival camp? I like the camp. I like the fact there's sort of lots of people getting together

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:37.080
and sort of it when the first couple years I went it was very very laid back it was very laid back

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.520
it was sort of it was like a camp people come out and they were there were people coming from all

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.160
over sort of different parts of the country and people coming from locally it was quite mellow

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.200
and like you said there was people sitting and sewing and and so people just sit there making

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.640
their costumes and stuff but as the I don't know as the years went on I think the hype factor sort

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:04.520
of stepped in a bit and it became less there was there were I think there were a lot more egos in

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:11.240
the room as as the years went on and it was it lost that I don't know my first one it was really

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.680
I was a bit of a hippie anyway and it had that it was like a camp it was there's people sat around

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.200
making their costumes there's music on you'd have an interval somebody come some people get up and

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.880
do a bit of drumming or some people get somebody get up and play his instrument or whatever

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:33.400
and then you'd go back really mellow out again and then and it was really easy going really nice

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:41.720
atmosphere really nice pleasant easy going atmosphere but as the years went on more people

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.080
it got bigger if you know what I mean more it seemed to get bigger and as it got bigger inevitably

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:53.800
it got a little bit more stressful so it's a it didn't I don't know I don't think it

00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:00.600
I don't think it I really I preferred it I quite like it when it was still fairly small because it

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:07.240
was it did have that really it was like a camp it was and which venue was that that was in Cotez

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:14.760
there was because then then there was a there was talk about um that little cafe there

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.360
and somebody got the franchise for it or something and

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:28.520
and we'd gone from passing around the sandwiches to to a franchise cafe and it was I don't know it

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:35.560
just it didn't seem yeah you got the feeling that I got the feeling that you know it was

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:44.040
as it picked up more people were getting interested then there was more people who were worrying

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:52.360
it had to be done right you know so it's a which yeah that's nice you know it's a big parade and

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.440
there's a lot of people going to turn out to see it you want it to be done right

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:03.640
but at the same time up you lost a little bit of that homegrownness about it it's uh yeah

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:13.560
so can you remember any particular characters from those years or people that you met during

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:23.080
can come to you like kevin and augie and and kora because they did they did they they taught me how

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:29.080
to do taught me how to do the stilt walking i really i really buzzed on that there was that um

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:39.320
that chat that big chat mo there's graham can you remember graham with the drums he still has

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:44.440
i see him on up in trail bridge actually he's moved to he lived in trail bridge i think he's

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.520
got something wrong with his leg because he's always got he's always walking with a stick

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:55.400
i know you remember the one the liver peglian one yes scarce one yeah uh marion with the steel

00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:04.520

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.080
oh what was his name i can't remember his name

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:15.960
i remember there's a lot of people there's chris from the san baguette who was um

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:25.560
steve steve fletcher obviously uh ali and tom and neg i knew anyway and gareth and bud and

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:34.120
all that crap i i already knew anyway uh so i think what else what else we we knew from from the

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:49.080
uh does lisa still go not not in recent years no no right i died already i knew lisa already

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.760
because i got guys

00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:03.480
oh my brain hurts what about your most memorable carnival incident can you remember

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:08.280
specific stories or incidents thrown out getting banned

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.320
that's charming loyalty would be nice as well

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.880
oh

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:28.680
and what did you do to get banned i threw i i one of the stanley knives used for cutting up the

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:35.320
bits of material and i i threw it into a piece of wood and then i got banned

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:43.800
health and safety i presume so yeah do you have any positive carnival memories

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:50.760
well yeah i just said i really enjoyed you know i really enjoyed the drumming and the stoke walking

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:57.000
and the sort of jamboree-ness of it all and i really enjoyed the i really enjoyed the atmosphere

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.480
in the first the sort of i quite enjoyed the sort of camp the sort of mellow sort of atmosphere

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:10.200
for a couple of years as well so in terms of the parade experience what do you sort of remember

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.400
of the parade days

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:21.400
i'm just getting on with it yeah the performance aspect of it i suppose

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.920
yeah well you don't you don't sort of you don't really clock so much of the performance while

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:32.440
you're actually doing it right because you're you've got you're focused on what you're supposed

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:37.400
to be doing so it's a what you're sort of you know what you're doing you can't really see who's

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:43.880
behind you that well and and that sort of thing you i would usually be involved with a drum with

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:50.760
a sort of drummy sort of section so you sort of that that takes up all your attention really your

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:56.200
drums are quite they're quite loud and sort of look at me so you don't you tend not to see

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:01.400
who's behind you tend to catch people what other people do more during the evenings

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.520
when you're working towards it if you know i mean you sort of

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:11.560
while they're doing a rehearsal or we'll get out and do this then you you see what's happening but

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:17.960
it's on the actual parade day itself and you you're quite focused on whatever you're doing

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:23.880
which is you would usually be playing the drums in some sort of uh in some sort of capacity i

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:31.320
suppose do you remember much about um the reception the parade got in terms of the crowd

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.520
on the kids yeah it all seemed to be very good it always seemed to be very good there was it

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:42.520
it seemed to be a nice mix of people who were just bringing the kids out for the afternoon and

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:48.040
and and people who knew people you know you'd always get somebody shouting somebody's name out

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:55.480
people who knew people and with a nice mix of people who were just out for the you know who

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.720
just come out for the for the evening you know sort of read i don't know whether they read it in the

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:13.400
echo or whatever and what was your sort of least enjoyable aspect of being involved in carnival

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:21.400
as i said it got very stressful towards the the last sort of year or so it got i think they would

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:27.000
it got bigger and it did seem to attract a lot of egos it got very

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.840
very they didn't it seemed to be about

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.440
it seemed to be a lot more about particular individuals than

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:43.880
then the thoughts of a car you know the car on the carnival atmosphere the the sort of

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:50.680
bring your friends and family along bring the kiddies along bring granny along

00:13:50.680 --> 00:14:00.040
and live a little love a little that all seemed to it all seemed to be very much about

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:06.920
particularly egos in the room rather than so for you i suppose my next question was

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:12.840
what does carnival mean to you what does a carnival experience mean to you it would be that

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:21.000
it was a it's a community that it was a community a community getting together to be create

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.600
creatively to say we're going to sit and enjoy each other's company work towards a goal

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:35.400
see what we can come up with artistically creatively and then at the end of it we're

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.560
going to enjoy it so it's a we're going to you know we're going to have a ball you know so it's a

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:45.480
that's that's what it was a that's what it was about i suppose that's why why do you know of

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:51.720
any other deaf and what was it would you know something i don't i know different people pick

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:57.480
out different aspects that is what carnival means to them depending on how they've been involved and

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:03.080
you know for some people it is the performance or yeah yeah i see what you mean yeah yeah

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.040
yeah yeah

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:12.760
so what in terms of um the value of cart of carnival it is that

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.040
being open access and bringing the community together or

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:29.160
yeah i think so i wasn't i was i never really looked at it yeah i want to get in a high profile

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:39.320
high stress levels a lot of pressure on to be you know tip top i quite like the quality of

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:47.640
in terms of the pressure in terms of the pressure i was quite i quite liked it like

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:52.680
that's what i liked about it initially was that it was you could meet people and it was very

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.600
it was very a way to meet people that was very laid back

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:04.520
but you but you're sort of working towards something so it's not it's not like down the pub

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:12.280
oh i'm fed up you give me another lager it was it was sort of you sat there quite

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:17.640
you'd be exactly being constructive and you get so you get to see people talk to people whilst

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:23.000
they're being constructive you see so it's a i quite but but laid back about you know not like

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.160
in a job situation where the boss are being by three and it's got to be done you know it is

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.760
i quite like that it was laid back you know it was i didn't really

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:41.240
i wasn't really getting it it was a there was a champion of egos there really it was a

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.320
it was lost on me to be honest it's i didn't really you know it didn't really occur to me

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:54.920
yeah that there is that level of carnival this is you sort of said all they were like actors or

00:16:54.920 --> 00:17:02.440
whatever in a in some sort of you know i i could now you say i can see it but it's a but i didn't

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.840
really get it at the time i just thought well you know we're we're sort of malloring out doing our

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:14.440
thing and there's a lot of people being very affecting sorry excuse me excuse my language

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:19.320
there's a lot of people with heavy vibes you know heavy vibes and i didn't really

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.560
i didn't really sort of i didn't really take to that but now you say

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:28.760
you know now you put it in that light i can i can i can understand yeah well maybe

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:36.360
so the performance element of it was was was you know sort of was that was their thing you know

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:40.040
but it's a i didn't really i just got they were being a bit

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:49.640
i got they were just adding a they they were just it just seemed to be a lot of stress to what

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:56.360
would otherwise have been quite a quite the sort of quite the pleasant time you see so would you

00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:03.480
come back i don't know i it's funny you should ask that because you said when you said would i

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:10.600
would would i do an interview i i thought well yeah why not and then after i'd said that i thought

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:15.560
crikey that's strange it's after all these years especially as i said i got thrown out that time

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:22.440
you see so it's quite the idea of i don't know i wouldn't say i wouldn't but i wouldn't say

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:31.960
i don't know i don't say i don't know my it's my my i've changed a lot since then so i don't

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:40.440
really know how that would exactly i don't know it's like asking somebody out on a date and it

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:47.480
uses a that you haven't seen for years and years you didn't you think well would i really would i

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.480
really have anything in common there's no reason why you shouldn't have you might have but but

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:56.760
there's no reason why you should have either you see so it's it's it's a i don't know i wouldn't

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:02.040
say i wouldn't start i wouldn't say it was impossible i wouldn't say no out of the question but i'd

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.840
but i'm getting an impression you still have a soft spot for kind of all

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:12.600
well that's why i don't i don't yeah fond memories but i don't that's why i don't know what it would

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:17.240
be like now i could turn up now and it could be everything i hated about it or i could turn up and

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:23.320
it could be everything i liked about it i don't know so well i suppose life's about risks in it

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:27.480
i certainly wouldn't i wouldn't certainly wouldn't say no i'd all certainly not

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.320
thank you very much
