00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Press record.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Not by my phone, that would be bad.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So today is Wednesday the 31st of May 2023.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
My name is Paul Hunt from Man Cap Cymru and could you introduce yourself please?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Yeah, my name is Janet Kensch and I'm a committee member and a volunteer with Man Cap Cymru.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So how did you get started with Man Cap Cymru again?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It was when we moved back here to West Wales.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I was born and bred in West Wales, well actually where I live now is about five minutes from where I was brought up in Sanderville.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I moved to Cardiff to do some work and then oh gosh I was there for, I had my two children and came back here with the whole family.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Back in 2001, because we were always looking for services for my daughter's school or any discipline.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We were looking at different organisations and got involved with Man Cap Ceredigion.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
That was 22, 23 years ago.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
On the basis of knowing what was available.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I found out that Man Cap Ceredigion didn't really do anything for children.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000
They were basically concentrated adults, which would have meant me walking away from them really because it didn't benefit Beth.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:46.000
But I was talked into staying and getting involved with committee work and was on that committee then for a while.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So how old is Beth?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
She's now 30 this year. She was born in 92, so she'll be 31 this year.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So you spent some time in Cardiff?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:07.000
She was born in 92, I lived in Bathy. She was born in Llandoc Hospital.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It took us a few years to get some, well actually we've never had a diagnosis, a proper one.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
But obviously we knew she had a learning disability when she was about two.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We'd looked at Swansea at that time, then we had Alcanson, Dylan, her brother.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So we pretty much knew when she was about two or three that she would have some difficulties.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And how easy was it to find services there compared to Ceredigion?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Just as difficult really. I can remember the time where the nurse, the district nurse, whatever you want to call her,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000
in the doctor's surgery saying, we haven't assessed, but yeah, it sounds like she'll need help.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And I can remember thinking, right, let's see what help is out there.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And sat in, we had a little library place in the house with a phone and desk.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And I thought, right, let's start, darling. And started bringing people up.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And they then would pass me on to somebody else, to another organization, so I did that.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And I suddenly realized that it was going to be very difficult to find support or help or advice,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:38.000
because during that hour, I followed all the places I was led to and came back to the first person I spoke to.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So there was a lot of agencies out there, but no concrete support in any way.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And this is in Swansea now, all well-meaning and everything, but nothing with practical support.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Then we got social services involved, and that meant loads of assessments.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And I mean loads, and they'd be coming to the house, a social worker, a nurse, a psychologist or something else.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And they'd come to the house and they'd be asking you the same questions.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And you'd think, oh, God, can you read the file before you came?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And I felt like somebody said, well, what you should do is record, like we're recording today,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
record everything and just say to them, look, I'll go make the coffee while you listen to the recording.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Because, you know, it was just repeating itself.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
But no, it was very little support, really.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
But then you don't know often what support you need either.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Now, that's what I found difficult.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
But we were there then for a few years and then we decided we...

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
She started a little school in Townhill, which was really lovely, Townhill School.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
A lot of people very snobbish about that.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.000
We tried to get into a Welsh school and they said, I'll never forget this Dr Tanimian Singleth Hospital.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Well, you know, you'd probably best stick to just teaching her English because, you know, when she grows up,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
there won't be many people speaking Welsh.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
She'll be able to support herself.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
You know, it was best to...

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And I regret that, really regret it, because, you know, she could have handled two languages easily.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
But anyway, she went to Townhill School, lovely school.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And then we decided to come back home.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And it meant going through the whole process again, if you like.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
But there was a difference, really.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.000
There was a really good children's department or whatever you want to call it.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I think it was in Pembroke.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And the person who led it was Errol Bray.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000
She's retired now, but I think she's still involved with a lot of stuff in the area.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And she had this unit there.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And they were really, really good.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
They had a good record.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
They set up a good respite system, although we never used it ourselves.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:27.000
They were involved with DASH, which was a parent led organisation that did holiday things.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
They took over these schools and you could come along.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And, you know, kids and the siblings as well, you know, would be in little groups and stuff.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
They did some respites in Teetlin, in Ketting near Aberaerhe.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Where people could, again, Bethan didn't take part in that.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.000
But, you know, your child could go there for a week and enjoy just being with other people.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
For the purposes of the tape, I should probably just say there's a gigantic dog sniffing around.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Which is not mine, by the way.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So as a unit, they were really, really good.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
But again, it was limited what they could do as well, really.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
But going back to my captain together, it's very limited what they could do because they were only really looking at adults.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000
But I always used to think, well, I'm glad I did get in contact with them because, you know,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.000
while your child is a child with a learning disability up until 18 to 25, you know,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000
there's a duty for supporting them, you know, educationally and social services wise.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And getting involved in that kind of thing highlighted how different it was basically as an adult with disabilities,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
because that duty goes out through the window, really.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000
What you're entitled to as an adult with an disability is totally different to the child.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So it was as much a shock to me then.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Well, I sort of planned ahead for Bethan as being an adult, knowing there wouldn't be anything really for her.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Far, far less than the support and services that she had as a child.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Growing up in Kheriteekyon as a child with disabilities was great for Bethan.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
She was lucky to be in Chandisil Primary School.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
They were very, very good.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
She went to an excellent secondary school in Newcastle Emily,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
even if they're headed by Helen Ling.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:44.000
So, you know, her childhood and her upbringing was good compared to a lot of people I know.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
I had a tough time with her, really.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I think we might have to pause and get the dog out because I think the breathing is going to be coming on the recording.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Oh, pause it. No, no, no, no. Pause it.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
So we're recording again just to get rid of the dog.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:11.000
So how did you feel when you first found out that Bethan had a learning disability?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Oh, God, I don't know. I've had to confuse her more than anything.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
The thing was that Bethan was born and a lot of my friends are having kids at the same time.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So she looked healthy. She looked beautiful, you know, to look at.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
But there were milestones that she wasn't compared to my friend's kids.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000
So she would be walking at the same time as them, not talking at the same time as them.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I can remember thinking, saying, well, you know, your child should have a hundred words, you know, for that.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
She was nowhere near that.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:03.000
But the main thing we noticed was her socialization, you know, where the other kids were starting to after about six months,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.000
noticing other children and getting involved or playing with things. Bethan wasn't like that, really.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And it took a while to convince doctors and nurses that I thought there was something wrong, you know.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
They'd say, oh, well, you know, children, they take a while.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
You know, she'll catch her, you know, in all this business. And she didn't.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And I think once I was told, yeah, you might be right here, I thought, no, thank God I've got something right.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Let's, you know, and I think there was a sense of or a mixture of relief or, I don't know,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
just the sense of that, you know, now we can get on with doing something about it.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
But as a parent, you will always have these feelings of great sadness and grief.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And, you know, depending on how severe that disability is, you know,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
they will be doing other things that your friends' kids will be doing, like, you know,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
going to university or getting married or having children.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And I think those milestones still hit you and you get quite emotional about it.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
But I'm lucky that, you know, I'm quite positive about Beth.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
She's quite an unique girl in her ways.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And because of that, I'd always be positive that she's beautiful and I can't think of her in any other way.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:46.000
So, I, you know, I can't say I was upset, might be the wrong word, or hurt or whatever.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:56.000
But with me, it was a battle just getting on with it and making sure that she was happy, content and safe.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And I think it changed my view of how to be a parent and how what I wanted for my children,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000
because I think if Beth hadn't been around, I would have been one of these pushy parents,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
you know, quite ambitious for them and push them to do this.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Whereas I'm far more relaxed and I'm certainly more relaxed with Dylan about, you know,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:25.000
what he's wanted to do in his life and that, you know, the mantra is as long as they're happy and safe.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000
That's it, you know, and that's all I want for them.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
But yeah, so that's that was basically how I felt.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000
A lot of the Mencap groups were set up to provide social opportunities for people with a disability.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Having had a son without a disability to start with, what were the differences in terms of those opportunities?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
What? Between Beth and Dylan?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Yes.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Massive, massive.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:04.000
We suddenly found out with Dylan how easy it was to bring up a child and go through those milestones.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Having with Dylan, you know, he potty trained himself really, basically.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:17.000
He'd go to sleep at normal times. He'd eat what, you know, there wasn't any issues about feeding or anything.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
He'd socialize with other children, go off and play and stuff.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
So there's a massive difference between Beth and the other.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:40.000
But what was lucky about us having Dylan as a second child was that Bethan seemed to speed up on her progression.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:48.000
She started speaking a lot faster and, you know, her mind stones were a bit faster getting through,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
knowing that Dylan basically was forcing her to catch up.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
I mean Dylan would, you know, whereas with us, it would take us a little time to coach Bethan to say things and whatever.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Dylan would demand it, you know, come on Bethan, let's go, you know.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And it's been like that through the night really.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And to today now, he's a great support with her, very defensive.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And, you know, we'll look after her forever, I believe.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:27.000
But what it's also done for Dylan is that he's been a better person for it, I think,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
because I know headmaster was telling me about him in primary school.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000
One thing about Dylan is if there's a child who starts is new, starting,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000
or there's a child who's sad or being bullied or finding it difficult,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Dylan's always the one to suss it all out or to go towards the child and support them in a way, be friendly and comfort them and so forth.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
And that is because he's been Bethan's brother, you know.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And because of that, I think that's why he's gone into the field of supporting Mencap Ceredigion himself, you know.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:12.000
He supports us with all the social stuff that we do and all the workshops and stuff like that, and they love him.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
But, you know, he treats them as equals.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:22.000
He treats them as friends and, you know, lives them dearly.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:31.000
But the other thing is, I think, that he's gone into teaching now is again because he's the type that wants to support and help.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And that I truly believe that's because, you know, he's had a system of him, just probably.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000
So back to Mencap Ceredigion, how did you first become aware of them?

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Well, again, by ringing when we came back to West Wales, we had all these organizations, you know, getting a list of stuff and just ringing.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And I got to meet the chair who's an amazing man, Bill Thompson, who'd been a chair.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
He's now passed away.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000
And Mencap in those days were a bit different to what Mencap Ceredigion was different to what it is today.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:27.000
And those Mencap Ceredigion in those days were far more involved with the provision of services and supported housing.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:40.000
They owned a few houses in the county and they employed, trained, you know, they were, you know, ran those supported housing issue.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:49.000
And Bill Thompson was a great one for, I think he was ex service.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:17:00.000
I think he was either Navy or, you know, one of these God through the war titles, you know, Sergeant Major, but such a gentle, lovely gentleman, you know.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:13.000
And he'd kept the ship together and sort of set up all of these things, respite, supported housing, services, social clubs and all of that.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
So it was all very, very well set up and everything when I got involved.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:27.000
He was very well respected by the professionals as well, by the authorities, you know, and well liked by the members.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:38.000
And I think one of the nicest letters, I have a few letters that have been given to me in my life from, you know, people I've worked with when I've left, they've sent me a nice letter to see it by, you know.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:45.000
But the one I treasure the most is from him that he sent because I had to leave Mencap Ceredigion for some reason.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Because I was concentrating on some work issues and I said to him, look, you know, I won't be able to do so much.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
And one of the letters I treasure the most is the letter he sent me.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:04.000
And it's there and I often now read a bit when you know you think, oh God, you know, it's getting too much.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:11.000
You know, you get your bad days and you read that letter and it makes you feel really good, you know.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:21.000
He was he was an amazing man and he was the lead of a big, you know, quite a set of quite strong committee members made up of parents.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:32.000
And they ran everything really basically until Mencap, Cymru came along or Mencap National.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
I can't remember the name. Sintje.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Clive. No, that's the guy who came down to do the transitional bit of Mencap Ceredigion, giving the houses.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Howard. Howard Sintje. Yes. Clive is the guy that invented the seat, the bikes.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Howard Sintje. And I remember he came to the Feathers Hotel to have a meeting with us and to reassure us that we were doing the right thing, really.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
But I didn't get involved with that so much.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
And I think the transition was quite small because the authorities helped it a lot.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
And there was some housing associations as well.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:20.000
And we have today supported housing in the county that are managed out by Mencap and by MIRAS.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000
But they wouldn't be what they are without Bill Thompson and that committee.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
They set it up. It was like fine.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
You know, really well looked after, well managed.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
So it's quite easy to just pick it up and go.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
What was the reason that they transferred over to?

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:49.000
I don't know what it was. I think I don't know because I wasn't involved with it at the time.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Whether it was because the parents were getting quite elderly now and it was a lot for them.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:05.000
And I mean, every organization will find this. It's hard to get people on board committees and being trustees.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:12.000
There's a lot of responsibility nowadays for that, whether it was that or whether and this is my guess,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:24.000
whether it was the legislations and so forth and the amount of liability the authorities had,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000
whether it was better for them to get involved with it really.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:41.000
And so Mencap then was involved with the whole thing of support and services and education and living accommodation and everything.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.000
To what we are today, which is something totally different and is run totally differently as well.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:56.000
But he was an amazing man and we were very, very lucky to have him in Ceredigion.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
We were very lucky to have the committee as well.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:08.000
You've mentioned that when you joined Mencap Ceredigion didn't do much with younger people.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Were there any other young people of members or were the parents similar age to you when you first joined?

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:25.000
No, they were a lot older than me, the parents, because obviously their kids were adults.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:33.000
My child was a child. But the great thing about it was though, better than getting involved with all the activities.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.000
If we had a disco, I'd bring the kids along. So the committee got to know them very, very early on.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:46.000
But what was really great is that my child, my children were getting to know the adults with their disabilities.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.000
So I was learning what it was going to be like in the future. And so did Beth and Dylan.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:02.000
And now Beth and Dylan are friends with these adults who are now obviously in their 50s and 60s.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
So they know them as friends now. It is literally like a family.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000
We know them all. We know their parents. We know what they had for breakfast, what their favorite things are.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:20.000
And I think the one thing that with Mencap Ceredigion is, and they're probably the same with other branches in Wales,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.000
and something that people don't realize or need to realize and need not to forget is that with Mencap Ceredigion,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:36.000
we are the only constant in their lives from the time they come on board as adults when they're 18, 29, to the time they die.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Because they will have support workers coming and going. Social workers will come and go. Doctors, nurses, teachers, you name it, whatever.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:58.000
They'll come and go. But with Mencap Ceredigion, we're pretty much there because we don't change in any way.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.000
We're the same committee, we're the same parents, we're the same members. Nothing changes.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
So I think that's quite a good thing about our organization.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:19.000
And for Beth and until then, they've got people that they've known, like the members I know, that we see coming to Gateway and to all the events that we hold.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:33.000
I've known them for nearly 25 years. So there's a certain element of trust and knowledge, which in effect is really, really important when you're planning on what we do as a service now.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:41.000
We're able to listen to them and understand them more than anybody really, besides their own family and friends, obviously.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:51.000
But certainly we know them more than a social worker. And that's not being disrespectful to the social worker, but that's just being practically honest.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:59.000
They're not going to know what people are like after knowing them for 25 years compared to knowing them from a file for five minutes.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:12.000
How did you gradually, your role with Mencap Cairdigan gradually change over the years? Because you're the chair now, is that?

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
No, I wasn't the chair. I was going, you know, the lead of that.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:27.000
My half-goals are out to chairs, you know, deputy chairs, secretaries, treasurers, I don't know if all we say.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:38.000
I came on board really with another lady who was involved with Mencap Cairdigan then, and that was Karen Blower.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:46.000
We were both the same age, the same. We like the same thing, we got quite friendly.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
And our job really was to organize all the discos.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:01.000
But we were new onto that committee and much as I loved all the committee members, oh, they were all fashioned about their attitude to people with learning disabilities.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
I mean, we had to bring them up to the 20th century.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:14.000
You know, a lot of stuff had happened since, you know, 1983 with the new legislation and, you know, the turn of the century with education and, you know, the Education Act.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
But they seemed to rule so back in the 1960s.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
And although we lived them to bits, Karen and I had to work really hard.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
You know, we used to give money out to organizations.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:37.000
And one of the things that I think was Kenal and Stiff and the Day Center in Lampeter for people with disabilities wanted a computer.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
So they sent us a letter to the committee and we then had a discussion.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
And most of the committee members were aghast with a computer.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
What do you mean a computer? People with disabilities don't use computers.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
But what do you do? They're silly, ridiculous.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:01.000
And we had to really fight hard to convince our committee that actually, yeah, you know.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:09.000
And of course, today with phones, I've had members come to me and I'll say, because I'm not technical, as you know,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
and I'll give them the phone saying, well, how do I do this, actually?

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Or, you know, you surf or whoever it is.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
And they'll take the phone off me and they'll sort they've sorted it out.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.000
So technically, our members are really up there, especially with social media.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Perhaps there's a bit too much in social media.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000
But it was difficult. I can remember one instance.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:39.000
We were organizing it. It was our first goal at organizing Christmas Disco in TGN.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
And I was at Lampardine University, Carambeau, either one.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
And we were dealing with the menu.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:54.000
And we decided that we'll have chicken and, you know, and these chicken, they can't have chicken.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
We always have sausage and chips.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
I said, why? Well, it's easy to cut it up for them.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
And I would look at each other and this is from another era, you know.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:16.000
So but we won that time. We got them chicken and, you know, proper dinner that they could cut themselves, I think.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
So we were in it. You know, it was you could see the generation gap there.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Really big time.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.000
And I'm not sure. I think Bill Thompson was with us, you know, he said, oh, yeah, I get you. I get you.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:45.000
But a lot of the committee members were really stuck in, you know, the the the old fashioned way of looking after all the awareness

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
and all people in disabilities in those days.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
So how they pushed back on some of those things.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Definitely. I can remember talking to them about the development of Cardiganabar Gaitway.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:07.000
And that has that started back 60 years ago, again, through Mencap.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
You know, these Gaitway clubs, they still do. We still do.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:18.000
But in those days, it was if you walked into a room, it would be the children.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000
And you're talking children in their 40s, 50s with the mums.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000
The mums were knitting and the children would do the jigsaws.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.000
That was the social night. And they used to call it the knitting club because the mums would bring their knitting along.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
You know, those attitudes have totally changed now.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:45.000
I mean, our social clubs now, whereas they used to be run and many of them used to do in day centers.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000
We purposely took them out to the day centers because we wanted them to be in the community.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:29:00.000
So our I know that Aberystwyth is a bit difficult because Aberystwyth is run separate to us and they have it in a football club or whatever,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000
not in a running club because there's a lot of security in the way.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:16.000
But the ones that we've set up in down south, it's like Cardigan now is a Cardigan Castle Cafe.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Again, with the community, the one in Abervillian, that one is a bit difficult. We're not all for that one.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
But the one in Newcastle Emlyn is in a pub.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
The one we're going to be setting up soon in Flintisill, that's going to be a pub.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Purposely because we're in the community and what we found is that the community are now getting involved with us.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Last Saturday, we had a meeting in the three campuses in Newcastle Emlyn and they did a buffet for us.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
And we brought our music system with us, which is the best thing we've ever bought.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:58.000
And we had microphones and we were all listening to music in the beer garden, dancing and everything.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000
And all of a sudden, the locals are coming out and joining in.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:08.000
And we've got a video of them all dancing with us and a group had come up for the weekend from Swansea and they joined in.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:19.000
And we had the microphones and we were all singing like karaoke and we were getting raffles because of the fundraising.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
I don't know, it's 20, 30, but they say, no, keep it clear.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:34.000
They did a fortune on it. But what was good was that the community was involved with us and we were involved with the community in front of you.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:46.000
And I think that's if you're asking for the difference between what it was like and what it is now, that's a very big positive as far as our members consider.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:54.000
All the different communities being with the groups that you take into cafes.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Absolutely. Well, think of it this way.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
People want to be kind.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
There are more good people than bad people, as Ros Angus said.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000
There are more people there who want to help you than want to turn their backs.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
So you want to take advantage of that, really.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:23.000
But on the business side of it, can you imagine when we went to Newcastle Ebbling, the Cardigan one, the Aberyne one was getting too full.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.000
So we went to Cardigan to decant to some of the world and we opened one in Cardigan.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
That was getting too full. So we then opened one in Newcastle Ebbling.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:39.000
And I can remember going through Newcastle Ebbling, which in its day was pup town, really.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000
We had about 26 pups in it in those days. It's not so much that now.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:54.000
But going around with pups to see whether we could open some sort of...

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
And everybody was really, yeah, yeah, yeah, they'd love it.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:06.000
But then what we went for, we went there on a Wednesday night, I'll never forget, and the pub was empty midweek.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Nothing happens in midweek. And there were fewer locals in there, I think very much.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
And it was the three campuses and we looked and it was ideal.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
It had a snooker table, great. It was an area to dance.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
There was a place to eat, a beautiful beer garden.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
And Wednesday was a quiet night.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
So we had a word with Pete and Jill.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:34.000
They said, yeah, great, you know, if you want, we'll do some food and, you know, we'll welcome them.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
So we had a problem.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
So now tonight, there's going to be a gateway there.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
There's going to be about 30, 40 people there.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Every one of them will be eating.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
You know, they'll probably spend a good tenner with drinks and everything.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:55.000
You know, so it's gone from a pub with a couple of locals on a Wednesday night to a pub that's heaving.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:03.000
And what's good about it is that the locals knowing there'll be a disco, you know, there'll be something on during the night, you know.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
It's a pop pool, it's a busy pub, it's an ice pub, you know, we'll go there.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000
So the locals, you know, we're actually helping commercially as well.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
And that goes for all the other gateways that we've got in the community.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
So it benefits the town as well, really.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:25.000
You know, the Premier Shop next door tells me, you know, they make a bomb on a Wednesday night.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
And then I say, why is that? Well, of course, we do a Rathford, don't we?

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000
And they're all in there, our lot, buying sweets.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
We've been told off about that before now that we shouldn't be raffling off sweets.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
But anyway, that's what the members want.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000
And they make a bomb on these sweets they buy and bring the bars of chocolates or box of chocolates.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
They make a mark in an increase in profits.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.000
What would have happened if you'd suggested taking people to the pub when you first joined Bank of Carid again?

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:05.000
I don't know. I think they would have been concerned.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Because with their gateway, you know, bingo.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
We do bingo. You know, they love the bingo.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
But only one game takes about 10 minutes, not the whole night.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
And then they go to a restaurant once a month or something.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Nothing wrong with that. But our members now, people with disabilities, they're expecting more out of us, you know.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
They want to work. Some don't want to work, but some do.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Some want to study more. Some want to socialize more.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Some want to travel. Some want to have a romantic relationship.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Some want to get married.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:52.000
What they want nowadays is a lot more than what it was 30, 40 years ago.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:59.000
So you as an ACORUS then, as a charity, you've got to, you know, it's member led.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
So they are the ones that tell us what to do.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Like tonight, this morning it was on Facebook.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Oh, what are we doing tonight, Jan? I don't know. What do you want to do?

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
You know, it's not we'll do this or any other.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:21.000
So then we spend a fortune on pub garden games, you know, like Giant Connect 4s and Giants.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Giants games and the garden. So we're we're at dark side, but outside.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
Yeah. And it's their choice. It's their side, you know.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000
That's the difference. When you joined, would you say?

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
No, I don't think it was. No.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:49.000
I mean, I think things have changed, not as a main category, but things have changed because of the different acts.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Like advocacy, self-advocacy, we're teaching our members now to have a voice.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
We're teaching people to listen to those voices.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Nothing without us to take gratitude.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000
It's there to make it a lot easier for us because they can.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
We'll organize it for them, but we don't have to think about what to do.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000
They'll tell us what to do.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:23.000
I think as long as they listen, people listen to them, then then, you know, we'll be OK.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:31.000
But there's still a lot of people out there whose attitude is or go then.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Was it something that happened gradually becoming member led or just happened over time?

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000
It was a gradual thing as we were concerned.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:50.000
We still had people who didn't quite understand, were not very peace-tee about things.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000
So it took a while. And there's still a battle sometimes.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:04.000
In fact, I often think with the situation we're in at the moment with a lot of cuts and the service has been cut back and stuff like that,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
that we are getting back to that.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:13.000
So there's a big, big danger of getting back to the old days where, you know,

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
that it's whatever money you've got, that's what you get.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:27.000
And we're not listening to other people as much as to looking at money, vice versa.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:38.000
How easy has it been for your members of the learning disability to get used to leading the organization and making decisions?

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
That's a hard one, really.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:49.000
I mean, we we had a self advocacy group in Kennedy, Cuncone, Kennedy Dump People's Fellows and that finished.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:56.000
And we were left to know with no advocacy service, self advocacy, there wasn't any advocacy service.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:02.000
But legislation has changed, not for the better, I'm afraid.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:08.000
So Mencak Kennedy decided that we'd set up our own self advocacy group.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000
And it was called, the members called it our voice our choice.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:19.000
And we helped it for a while, facilitated it, helped them with meetings, administrations, stuff like that, until they were set up.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
And we consciously then let them go.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Because one thing with self advocacy, it has to be independent of any other organization, any other service, because otherwise it won't work.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000
And we were really, really big on that.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:47.000
But it is difficult to get them to run the meeting effectively.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
So you still need to support them.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000
But it has to be that it's supporting them and not doing it for them.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:00.000
And that's been a really difficult transition, especially if you're somebody like me.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000
I like to be in control of stuff.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:10.000
And I, you know, I blame myself a lot where I'd be in the meeting and I'd say, oh, you don't do it that way.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000
You do this way, you know, and trying to have hands off.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
It's more my problem, I think, than their problem.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Because on Saturday they had a meeting and I would stick myself on the chair and I'd like, I'm not saying a word and keep your mouth.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
And you know what? They ran it fine.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:40.000
So I think there's a bit of confidence in letting them get on with it, but be there to be supportive and not be doing it.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000
So Mencap Ceredigion is separate to Mencap Cumbria.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.000
What's that relationship been like in the last 20 years?

00:39:50.000 --> 00:40:00.000
It's been an odd one really, to be honest with you, because first of all, it's difficult for people outside that don't know us to differentiate the two.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.000
And I think they have to, to be honest, because we do two different things, as far as I'm concerned.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Mencap Ceredigion is a branch, very small branch, of volunteers.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Mencap Cumbria is a charity and they, you know, it's through our wails.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000
And we're not the same in as much. We have the same ideals.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
We have the same hopes and so forth for our members.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000
We support them in the same way, but we do two different things.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
So that was difficult for me because I.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:50.000
I thought of them as two separate things in as much one fighting the other for the same thought, if you know what I mean.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
And that was hard for me, especially funding wise.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:09.000
There were a couple of issues that really I wasn't happy about where, for instance, if somebody did a will and it was somebody died and it was somebody in Ceredigion,

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
the money that that will was going to was going to Cardiff.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
So we we didn't get a look in. So there's a lot of that going on.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
But I don't know. And we work really, really closely now.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.000
I think we've got a really good positive relationship.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Wayne is very supportive of the work that we do, as is he's been supportive of all the other branches.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000
And you yourself, Paul and all the other staff always at the end of the phone.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:45.000
The the the head office, you know, in Kidaminsters, where the main office is.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Then there's another.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
It's a branch. Oh, this.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:42:02.000
There's nothing that they won't do for you if you want to get free T-shirts or you want some advice on, you know, volunteering and shares or insurance or stuff like that.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:09.000
They're there. And I think as a small branch, you need that big brother support, you know what I mean?

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000
But at the same time, Wayne's really good in letting us get on with this as well.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000
What we do is legal. He's bothered.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:30.000
But, you know, he's really, really supportive of things like, you know, one thing I do find with being in West Wales,

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Big gripe with me is everything is happening in Cardiff.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Well, if if if a charity is an all Wales charity, they should be covering all of Wales.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
You know, they get the funding to support all of Wales.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:52.000
But you often find all of these charities are based in Cardiff and all the money is drifted over to Cardiff.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Whereas with Mencap, they very much I feel and I see anyway that they spread their resources across Wales.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.000
They spread their funding, if possible, across Wales and all their projects and all their people.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000
I mean, now we've got a development officer, Rod Drews, who lives in Llandronddol that comes westward.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:26.000
And, you know, I think I think we're quite lucky as a branch to be associated with Mencap as a whole and to recognize,

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
well, respect and charity.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
Plus, we've got our supported housing as well, half of which are covered by Mencap as well.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
So, you know, we've got a strong base in Cardiff.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000
I know a lot of other counties don't even have a branch.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:50.000
But, you know, I think it's quite a good outfit where the national, regional and branch works really, really well together.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Could you tell me a little bit about the Comic Con?

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Comic Con, we as a branch have the fingers in lots of pies.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
You know, we have a gateway.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000
We have a swimming group.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:10.000
We have a lot of talent, artwork, all sorts of things.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:22.000
But my daughter was really, really interested in a lot of our members in animation, anime, Disney and other Japanese stuff.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:28.000
And she used to love dressing up and going to comi, what you call them?

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000
Comic Con conventions where you dress up and so forth.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.600
I wish to take her to London and stuff. I remember taking her to one in

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.520
The Hacks article

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:45.480
One of these big places anyway, Excel Center, Excel Center, and I can remember going in there

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:49.800
She was dressed up. I wasn't and I felt really really standing out

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:55.340
You know I was in normal clothes and everybody else was dressed up and it's a massive place

00:44:55.640 --> 00:45:01.660
And there's this big room in there and they were all collecting something or other in bits

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:06.060
Thousands and somebody said to me there's 80,000 people in this room

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:09.060
all dressed up

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:14.300
And I know there's only 75,000 living in Keredikio. We could have filled the whole of Keredikio

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:17.100
And there's a massive massive

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:21.620
Different things to do with animation

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:27.700
But what I noticed was an awful lot of people with learning disabilities and autism were really keen

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.900
Why I don't know but there's a massive following

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:35.860
Bethan used to go to all these places and I've said there's only two places that I

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:44.780
Have seen Bethan which I would say she fits in. She's like a normal person if there's such a word as normal and that's

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:49.580
Disneyland Paris

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:53.900
Disneyland in Florida and any convention, right and

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:57.300
They fit in

00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:04.140
And I remember Bethan we were driving back from London and she said to all these journeys can we not have one in Wales?

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:12.260
Can we not have one in Keredikio? I said what a convention? Yeah, I said, oh, yeah, I suppose we could

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.300
And we thought yeah, that'd be great idea

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:21.560
Nothing ever happened and this is one particular like we were in Cardigan

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.520
Never forget Cardigan Gateway and there was a support worker there was new and I've seen it before and

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:37.640
Bethan hooked up to this support work and they were there was disco and dancing and they were talking together and they were really into

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:39.760
you know each other type of thing and

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:43.120
spoke to her and her name was Rowan and

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:48.280
She said oh Bethan's fascinating. I love animation said

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:53.280
And she and Bethan had this t-shirt on with some anime remark that any

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:01.920
Serious serious anime person. Yeah, no one else knew her but an anime and she was attracted to that issue. I turned out the Rowan

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:12.780
Not only had she been to Japan where Bethan would love to go to she'd actually gone to University of Japan to study animation

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.440
and

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:18.880
She was actually involved with wild films on a part-time basis as well

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:23.360
so she was doing a bit of soft and support work and she was involved in that and

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:27.200
What developed out of that was?

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.480
Rowan and Bethan

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:35.840
Hannah who's another sport goes would a brilliant artist an animator and

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:42.000
Jake who is a well-known Jake reticulous of one and filmmaker encounter

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:44.960
Teamed up the four of them and they set up

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:52.880
Kennedy gone animation group and with that group they they meet up on a regular basis and they've made good

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:59.720
Three four five films animated films during kovat. They were having two meetings every week

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:03.840
And not only a members in Kennedy young

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.960
But with people from Cardiff pretend

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:12.120
Pembrokeshire and they meet up on zoom and they're brilliant artists as well

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:18.060
And they do an awful lot of work together and they've had some awareness days. They've had some

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:21.440
workshops in

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:26.120
Cardigan small world theater and everything and think we got some money

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:32.520
From my films and from company to actually have a convention. And so we are the first convention and

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:37.880
About three or four hundred people came along to it. We've made two films for it

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.080
Actually in the abbey's with our sentence

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:45.400
We have the next one then or the 28th of March

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:48.040
And let's get it

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:50.800
2020 2090 when was kovat?

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:53.920
2020 and

00:48:53.960 --> 00:49:00.240
That was the week that kept you decided to do a lockdown. We did it a week before actually, okay, and

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:04.160
I'd beth on the computer

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.640
Telling everybody that we had cuts but we had ours

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:12.160
About two months ago. I've got loads of people coming along and we're now

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:16.280
Determined unless we've got another kovat to do it on an annual basis

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:27.680
Most most are yeah, but no there are people there as well who

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:34.480
Are just interested in animation and it's working with universities and other agencies

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.800
But we it's it I

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:45.440
Can see being a lot not bigger money this but it's just getting what?

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.480
What was the impact of kovat on?

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:51.520
the organization

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:54.400
Crikey

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:56.400
That was a big shock to us because

00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:02.960
Everything came to a stop. It wasn't a gradual stop. It was a stop. So all our social clubs couldn't meet

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:10.920
So we within a week decided and we were probably one of the first

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.520
to use social social media I

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:18.000
Found out about zoom never had a zoom before

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.520
still don't quite understand that it works, but anyway and

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:24.960
With very very quickly we were using FaceTime

00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:28.800
We got a lot of volunteers along

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:37.380
And we did things with our members things like Monday night was a quiz night

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:45.760
Wednesday Saturday comedy nights everybody had to come along with a you know a joke

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:48.440
We'd have marks out of ten

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:51.120
We had Friday coffee morning

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.200
Then we had things like keep fit

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.000
We look at volunteers that keep fit with them

00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:04.400
We did some cooking. They didn't do much cooking. I think we couldn't done more. We had Tom Tom Evans

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.080
who

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:09.600
Is it is it right he's got a

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:14.120
relative to learn disabilities and he wrote a

00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:17.160
whole book feel like and

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.000
he read he wrote it and

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:27.280
Read it every single day of the lockdowns every day and

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:33.280
Other people did I mean Rihanna for instance

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:40.960
she used to do the competition of the week where she'd take a photo of a jar with

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:45.800
Jelly beans in it and you have to guess how many so on a Monday

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:49.640
You'd have you'd have the picture and then people be sending in their guessing, you know

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:56.240
and the next week would be a box of pencils how many pencils are the things like that that

00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:02.720
They would get involved with that sort of thing and then we got a pop group

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:06.400
Dunham was friends with and with the lead singer did a

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:09.480
a night wake Sanloth songs from

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:16.200
We had George from cut comedy entertainers having discos and we were really poor we were

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:20.840
Faf to say and busy an hour with them when we were before Colbert

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.840
But the other thing that we did as well

00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:25.640
was

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:30.720
We were on the other on the side the other side of the phone if people were in need of any help

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:36.760
So and we would refer like if people couldn't get to a shop or something that we could ring the authorities and get them

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:39.840
To a food bank or whatever so that it was that link

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:44.760
But what we were conscious of was

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:51.020
That not many people where people weren't on social media, how were they coping?

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:58.160
We were disappointed. I have to say with some of the supported housing organizations not being supportive

00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:04.280
And getting their members on social media. They've every house has got a computer

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.520
Stuck in their office. That's a problem

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:13.160
But there was nobody I can remember one sport worker telling me I don't agree with social media

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:19.440
I think it's terrible that they can you know can also the problems as though I don't really care what you think I

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:25.800
Want that person on Facebook? He's able to do it. I want you to support it and as it was you have to

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.200
but I

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:31.600
Think the worst thing about covert

00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:36.800
For certain people who weren't in contact with us through social media or zoom

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.760
Was they miss their friends?

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:48.120
You know a lot of people think people with disabilities, you know, they're not really good at communicating or socializing or you know

00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:54.520
They don't have eye contact. So how can they make friends and how you know all of this business?

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:01.640
But actually they are the most social people in the world and they really really missed gateway

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000
there was one person

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:07.120
Who used to bring me every week I?

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:10.460
Know what he said to me on the other side of the phone was

00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:13.360
When is the Christmas disco?

00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:19.880
When is the gateway when when am I gonna see my friends and stuff and they were breaking their hearts?

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:27.040
Because they could they just didn't have a social life and I always think but I see these

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.400
policies coming from the wretched assembly, you know

00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:33.360
Supporting people to go to work

00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:36.240
Whether they like it or not, they could have exposed it gonna work or

00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.120
Supporting people to live independently

00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:41.840
To cook to pay the bills

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:44.480
I know

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:51.640
The different things but there's very very little I was hoping they'd learn from the pulpit situation

00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:53.880
fairly little about social life and

00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:57.200
They are a wild they have a right to

00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:03.360
To how to socialize but there's very little provision up there for a social like

00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:06.160
Supporting people to go out

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:11.040
Not just go to the pub. I've seen support workers taking people for a coffee

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:17.800
Go for a coffee seems to be a big thing or go to the pub for a drink, but nothing about socializing

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:25.920
Helping them to get to know where the people for instance, that's what we aim to do with our gateways

00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:33.680
I mean, you know a social worker who sits next to a person in one of our gateways and

00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:40.320
They don't get involved with their client or other people. They're there on their phones

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.920
We take a photo of them

00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:47.040
I mean shows of it till this is not the way to support people

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:54.720
So we encourage our social workers and support workers and they do to not only get involved with the clients

00:55:55.400 --> 00:56:01.800
But also get involved with the whole group so the client can get to know people be friendly

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:04.880
You know socialize. Yeah, and

00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:07.880
they can a lot more out of

00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:12.160
Their social events by doing that really they missed it over

00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:17.180
And then men connecting we're getting really upset

00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:22.080
But I tell you the first gateway part of the plant I

00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:28.220
Mean there were tears, you know, it was just hugs. Although we were supposed to hug we were

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:37.540
But that was the first time we had just really emotional which just goes to show is that people with disabilities can

00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:44.560
You know have certain relationships that are really important for them. When lockdown ended and things got back to

00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:46.880
normal

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:51.080
Did things for men cap care again get back to normal straight away or?

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:56.640
We really wanted to get back straight away into normality

00:56:57.120 --> 00:57:01.480
There were legislations that stopped us to do it as fast as you could do as opposed

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:07.880
You know, we had to have our meetings outside instead of inside and all this business. We had to have masks

00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:13.480
We had to do this we have that which you know made life a little bit difficult, but I would say within a month

00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:15.240
We were back to normal

00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:17.240
But with the members back to normal

00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:22.440
Yeah, to a certain degree I think I think it took them a bit of time

00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:29.960
You know with the wearing the masks of the worry of COVID and oh we can't touch or you know

00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:36.200
Things like that and especially support workers could work for agencies who are very strict about

00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:38.680
You know wearing the mask

00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:44.960
For a lot more than they needed to or couldn't sit next to people the third regular meeting

00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:48.560
Sit next to people the third regulations are quite strict really

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:53.560
Whereas we're more laid-back. I suppose we're more maverick or more

00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:56.360
in your face

00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:02.240
Which is which makes it more disappointing that a lot of agencies now

00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:07.200
Certainly the authorities are still not back to normal

00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:13.320
The day centers are still not open and we're doing three years now. The offices are still not manned

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:15.880
You know now if I want to get in contact with

00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:21.200
Somebody in in social services. I've got to go through the reception area

00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:28.160
They take my telephone number or my email address and then that personal come back to me

00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:30.680
And I know that person is working from home

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:34.960
Which often means the baby's crying in the background or the dog is barking

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:41.280
You know my computers down my computers next door. I can't oh and I think oh dear dear dear dear

00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:46.640
You know things have not gone back to normal and it'll take a while I think

00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:51.320
People have been given choices of working from home

00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:55.520
Which I think is good because you know environmentally is good

00:58:55.920 --> 00:59:00.320
But they need to be making sure that the service doesn't change

00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:06.800
And the people that are working from though are actually working in a place that can be adapted into a working area

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:08.800
And I don't think that's been done

00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:14.560
And I think we're missing out on services certainly because of of that and the way

00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:18.080
Services are running at the moment. So they're far far

00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:23.120
Slower to get back to normal but as far as we're concerned as if COVID never happened really

00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:25.840
so finally

00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:28.640
Been at Mancap Coyote again 20

00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:31.600
23 years

00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:32.240
23

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:34.240
Are there any new Jans joining?

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:36.960
Are there any new Jans joining?

00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:41.360
Oh, I hope so

00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:49.440
It's hard to get volunteers really hard especially nowadays because um,

00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:52.800
You know people are working one two jobs

00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:57.280
Um, you know things are harder nowadays really

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
um

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.320
We've got a couple of people coming along

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:09.120
I think it's more mindful than anything in trying to let things go and the worst one to delegate

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:11.440
um

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.760
I give somebody a job to do

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Oh, you know

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:22.320
Gil they they're not doing it properly. Give it to me. I'll do it. I'll finish it all. I'll do it

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.080
um

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:28.400
But we have started we have to do one again where we had a friend's tea

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.960
Where is a mixture of interested friends and parents?

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.360
um, and I think we need to work and persevere on that because otherwise

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
You know, no, there won't be another Jan

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:44.240
And you've got to have another journal, you know to have a pool of

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:47.020
volunteers and able to take over

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.600
Well for the future finish there. Thank you very much

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.520
