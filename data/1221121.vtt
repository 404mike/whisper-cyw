He wanted me to join a group of men that took care of men when they died.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.500
We don't allow anybody else to touch them.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.500
When a Jewish person dies, in the Orthodox community they are never left alone until they're buried.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.000
And in our community we don't do that because we don't consider it necessary.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.500
But I take care of everything with my team.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.000
I've got four guys from the persons taken to the funeral home.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We wash them and prepare them for burial.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Say prayers, put them in a coffin, screw the coffin down.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And I've been doing that since 1986.
