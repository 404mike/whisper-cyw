00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880
Let us firstly say thank you to Heritage Lottery Wales who supported this project which is

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.840
about Tiger Bay, Bute Town and that area and try to help people understand something about

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.840
the place.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.200
HDA is grateful to them.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:27.880
This particular episode, story is an explanation which attempts to counter one of the nastier

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.640
and more mischievous impressions about Tiger Bay and Bute Town.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.720
In particular about Tiger Bay.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.040
No one would say Tiger Bay was an area without crime.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.040
It certainly had gambling.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:50.020
But consistently in the papers and in material you'll read now if you go onto Wikipedia

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:57.880
and tap in Tiger Bay you will find that it says area of high prostitution.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.380
In fact what it says is the centre of prostitution in Cardiff at the time.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.140
The problem with that is it simply wasn't true.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.460
The crime figures don't show it nor does the other evidence.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.460
What people do, lazy researchers and lazy people generally who want to collect stories,

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.700
what they do is they say well it's in the newspaper.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:32.860
Well the newspapers, much of them were attacks on Tiger Bay and its residents and people

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.100
from other countries.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:44.820
There was an article in Wales Online which was back in June 2019 when they talked about

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.980
the Cardiff Peaky Blinders.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:57.740
And just like there was the Shelby family in Birmingham who were the actual Peaky Blinders,

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.220
Cardiff had its own.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.940
And their main area for prostitution were two streets, both of which were lined with

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.860
brothels, Charlotte Street and Whitmore Lane.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.380
Now if you're looking for them in Tiger Bay well you're not going to find them because

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.260
actually they were outside of Tiger Bay.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.460
They are now where you will find the Marriott Hotel.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.660
Both those streets will be under the Marriott and under the car park and they were alongside

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.620
the canal which of course is gone as well.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.300
So if you were to compare a map now from 1851 to the present day you'd find yourself digging

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.380
up the lobby on Marriott Hotel with a JCB to find any remains of Charlotte Street in

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.700
particular but also Whitmore.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.980
Those areas were filled with pimps and prostitutes, gangsters and thieves.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:59.620
And there's a lot of research being done on this by a gentleman called Anthony Reese whose

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.460
relatives came from that area.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.740
There is no evidence to show Anthony Reese's relatives were part of those particular industries

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.540
but they came from that area.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.780
Now what he's done in his work and there's a book called Notorious and a great deal of

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.660
research he's identified some of these people.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.900
People like Ned Llewellyn, Livable Dick and the aptly named John Thomas, we won't go there,

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:36.220
were reported in the Cardiff Merthyr Guardian in 1847 because they used to kick and knock

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.740
the poor girls about as a boy would a football.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:46.740
The canal that ran alongside those areas became known for suicides.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.100
With reports of prostitutes throwing themselves into the water in desperate bids to escape

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.620
the horrors of their daily lives.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:01.740
Those canals were also full of numerous unwanted babies, some of which were drowned and others

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:08.220
suffocated beforehand and certainly dismembered bodies were also found bobbing in the water.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.740
But plenty of women were also involved as brothel keepers such as Mrs. Protheroe at

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:20.980
63 years of age was the oldest owner of the oldest brothel in Cardiff and she got a lion's

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.660
share of the business on Whitmore Lane.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:31.900
Not least because Whitmore Lane was right next to a building where sailors got paid

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.660
off after they were arrived back from the ships and there were others like Mary the

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.860
Cripple so called because she had withered legs and could not walk.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.980
She was an amazing woman given her circumstances says Mr. Rees.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.020
Imagine being a disabled woman living in the early Victorian period and still managed to

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:59.980
carve out for yourself a 40 year career as the head of a small criminal empire first

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.620
in Newport and then in Cardiff.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.980
Her first arrest is recorded in 1835 when she got sent down for keeping a brothel and

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:17.620
she was still procuring girls in Cardiff in 1876 41 years later and her son Abraham Reardwood

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.660
was still running brothels in Cardiff up until the 1920s.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.580
Now you'll find very little about Charlotte Street or Whitmore because it was such an

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.480
embarrassment that actually they didn't talk about it.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:38.920
There wasn't much in the press because well I guess for those kind of areas to be such

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:47.540
a great success someone would need to know and let's say someone would be assisting

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.840
the criminals to try and make sure they did not end up in court.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.560
Now all of the petty sessions books that's the transcriptions from the court are in the

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.360
Glamorgan archives.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.400
Meanwhile now if you think about where to drink in those streets there would be places

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.500
like the lame chicken, the Noah's Ark, the flying eagle, the wild wave, the Irishman's

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.280
glory and the coal hole all of which are gone.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:20.040
One booze out of one pub may well survive that's the Golden Cross which started as

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:26.380
the shield and Newcastle in 1846 before changing its name several times.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.440
It was on what would have been the corner of Whitmore Lane and Bute Street.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.460
Now that's the only connection.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.860
Bute Street was at the very end of Bute Street.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.740
It wasn't part of the bay it was certainly not part of Bute Town.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.300
Now there are very very few pictures of the people from those times.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.360
There will only be on court record in mugshots.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:54.400
There is one such on Wales online of Swansea Dan also known as Daniel Davis a boatman and

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:00.720
a bully from Whitmore Lane and he was sent to Pentonville prison in 1876 for a firearms

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.720
charge.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:07.820
Now the connection between the boatman and the prostitution is quite important.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:14.720
An awful lot of boatmen according to these records were also what's called bullies.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:23.700
A bully was the other name for someone who was a pimp and operated a ring of prostitutes.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:29.940
We need to be clear these people were not from Tiger Bay.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:38.260
They were not the people identified by the papers which largely were these people from

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.140
other countries from overseas.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:47.760
The nearest most of these people came from being overseas is because at the time there

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.800
was a strong connection between Irish families and the crime.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:58.100
But the one thing we do know is someone needed to be blamed and once again that was Tiger

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:06.480
Bay and the many races who lived possibly up to 45 different nationalities in modern

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.720
terms that lived in Tiger Bay.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:14.060
Now I'm not saying there weren't prostitutes in Tiger Bay but there is a big difference

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:21.660
between prostitutes which were all over Cardiff, brothels which were all over Cardiff and an

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:29.940
occasional brothel and the main centres and the way most of the time it's described is

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:36.180
that Tiger Bay was the main centre of prostitution.

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:37.980
It was not.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:47.160
It was a residence for families, for merchant seamen in between ships and for extremely

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:56.280
wealthy people who occupied places such as Mount Stewart Square, Loudoun Square etc.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:02.880
So the point of what I guess I'm trying to say here is much is said about Tiger Bay.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:10.220
If you read something about it I would suggest you say where's the evidence?

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:17.540
The reality is Tiger Bay was a working class area full of people who lived their lives

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:24.480
and as the city got wealthier and wealthier from the work, much of it of those working

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:33.120
class people it increasingly wanted to distance itself from the working class environment

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:43.040
and those people from overseas and they became the brunt and the blame for so much that was

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:52.940
normal in Cardiff and crime certainly was before the people from the Empire arrived

00:09:52.940 --> 00:10:00.140
in the bay there were different gangs operating in Cardiff regularly but there is no evidence

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:09.840
to show that the people from the bay or the new people from overseas in terms of certainly

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:19.480
Africa, Arab countries, Caribbean countries, Italy, India, there's no evidence to show

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:29.680
they were major players or running brothels or leaders in criminality.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.680
There is a great deal of evidence to show however they were family people.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:40.640
I hope this has helped you understand a little bit about how people get labelled and then

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:50.260
conveniently that label stays because people quote a paper from 1850 or 1880 when there

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:56.160
was no complaint against what was written in the press about you.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:56.840
Thanks for listening.
