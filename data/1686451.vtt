00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.880
The intention of this brief project is to help people understand the culture, the commitment,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:23.400
the sacrifice, the contribution of people who were from that village in Cardiff called

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:36.300
Tiger Bay, Bute Town, Cardiff Docks, and to maybe have an understanding about just how

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:46.320
committed they were because they remain there or they remain Welsh to this day. Firstly

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:55.200
let me say on behalf of HTA thank you to Herridge's Lottery for supporting us so we were able to

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:05.520
undertake this brief project during an extremely messy time of Covid and it I have to say would

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:12.880
have been a lot easier otherwise but nonetheless thank you to Herridge's Lottery. In the June of

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:26.520
1919 when Tiger Bay and Bute Town were attacked by white mobs over a number of days the press

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:36.280
coverage the reaction of the minister the appropriate minister which was Winston Churchill

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:48.760
was very notable the blame was directed towards the residents of Tiger Bay who were attacked by

00:01:48.760 --> 00:02:03.880
white mobs which meant their actions in trying to save their homes their businesses actually much

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:19.680
more importantly their families from the mob were self-defense. Now we looked at what happened in

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:35.320
court and I have to say been surprised because the courts attitude and the police the attitude of

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.200
the police because witness statements from the police are very clear about where they lay the

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.720
blame from serving police officers let me say this is not the chief constable this is serving

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:57.520
police officers the attitude was a surprise the decisions in court were legally correct without

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:12.680
any doubt but also were very clear in punishing the white the ten white men who were arrested

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:26.960
and charged by the police were all punished the treatment received by the black and other diverse

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:39.480
community representatives people who were arrested by the police was actually very very fair. Black

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:48.880
men in court that's Afro-Caribbean Arab mainly and African black men found guilty in Swansea

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:56.080
court as a result of their role in the Cardiff riots well despite 15 men being taken to court

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:03.320
some with very obvious injuries the court acted in a reasonable and fair way towards them the

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.000
press may have placed all the blame on the black people of Bute Town and Grangetown but the court

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.680
did not the offences punished were largely unavoidable in terms of punishment they were

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.080
mainly gun related in relation to violence towards the police and shooting directly into

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:32.200
the crowd black men found guilty were Mohammed Ali Ali Abdul Iver Gabriel Lenzman and Mohammed

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:40.600
Qayyid also known as Ahmed Qalad so only four men were found guilty others found not guilty

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:51.440
all no evidence presented were Ismail Mohammed Cham Ali Saleh Abdullah Saeed Ben Saeed Farah

00:04:51.440 --> 00:05:02.120
Mohammed Mohammed Hassan John Tucker Mohammed Sharif Issa Mohammed Mohammed Abderi and John

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.000
Abdullah so the black the four black men who found guilty was sentenced to prison in Swansea court

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.640
the four men were as I say Ali Abdul was age 26 a fireman on the merchant ships he was given four

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:21.560
days imprisonment for assaulting Frederick Gregory a police constable I should add he'd

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:29.960
already been in prison for nearly seven weeks sub waiting trial Iver Gabriel Lenzman was age 21

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.480
a ship's cook and he was given a three-year prison sentence for shooting at Sydney Jones

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:44.320
William Clark and James Coombs Ahmed Qalad known also as Mohammed Qayyid age 25 a ship's

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:51.400
donkeyman was given 15 months hard labor for shooting at John Porter a police constable

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:58.960
Mohammed Ali age 27 was given three months hard labor for shooting at Henry Brotherton and Ernest

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.160
May except for John Abdullah who is listed as a shopkeeper but was also a boarding house owner

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:12.080
all of the black men were in the merchant Navy at the time of the riots and therefore it's extremely

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:19.520
likely that they were also involved in World War one now thanks to the Cardiff Story Museum

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:26.240
we know that a number of people were compensated for loss of goods and damage during the riots

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.960
the bulk of those being in Bute town some of these were among the men that appeared in court

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:38.880
the figures I'm going to quote show the actual amount received and the modern equivalent in 2017

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.960
according to the National Archives in London Mohammed Ali now he was found guilty in court

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:51.440
and was sentenced three months hard labor nonetheless he received sixty pounds sixty

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:58.200
seven pounds ten shillings compensation a modern equivalent of a thousand one thousand nine hundred

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:04.640
sixty one pounds and so we can understand that in a real context what we're also going to do is quote

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:12.280
what that meant if you were a skilled tradesman that's the high level of salary so that would

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:22.640
have been 204 days wages for a skilled tradesman at that time John Tucker received 30 pounds that's

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:34.160
the equivalent to in 2017 of 886 pounds 26 pence 92 days wages Mohammed Sharif received 14 pounds

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:46.720
421 pounds 34 in 2017 money and 43 days wages at the time now John Abdullah who owned a shop

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:54.080
and boarding house which was the center of a lot of the damage received 175 pounds now that's the

00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:05.040
equivalent of just over five thousand pounds and it was 531 days wages is a Mohammed received 12

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:14.240
pounds 348 pounds equivalent which is the equivalent of 36 days wages Ishmael Mohammed

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:24.720
received seven pounds 203 pounds 14 2017 and 21 days wages Sayyid bin Sayyid received four pound

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:36.480
116 pounds 23 equivalent and 12 days wages Fahra Mohammed received five pound 145 pounds 29 equivalent

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:46.400
and 15 days wages Sali Abdullah received six pound the equivalent of 174 pounds 35

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:56.000
18 days wages and Mohammed Hassan received five pound the equivalent 145 pounds 29 and 15 days wages

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.880
so although the events were savage and caused some serious physical injury to the black merchant

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:09.280
seaman the treatment they received in court reflected the fact that they did not start the

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:17.440
riot also the compensation amounts were significant at that time so despite the press consistently

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:23.440
for most of June placing the blame for the Cardiff riots on black people living in Cardiff that was

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.800
not the conclusion reached by the court and they received compensation for loss of belongings and

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:36.240
damage to property it's interesting to note that even that these events occurred 20 years before

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:43.680
the start of world war one world war two and despite racist attacks brutality by white mobs

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:50.160
and overt threat to their families these black people returned to the sea in world war two to

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:59.920
assist britain in world war two at least 645 arab merchant seamen serving on the britches navy

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:12.240
merchant navy died of the 479 men who listed their last known address 242 sailed out of wales

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:23.920
30 from barry 12 from swansea 10 from newport 189 from cardiff our research shows that 330

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:32.240
men born in the caribbean died serving on the uk merchant navy in world war two 56 of those

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:39.760
listed their last known address as wales three from newport 11 from barry and 42 from cardiff

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:49.200
these men left at least 35 wives behind in wales also there were sisters daughters brothers and

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:58.240
mothers listed in next of kin now this shows that the riots racism attacks failure of government

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:04.160
unions and others to support men none of this changed their commitment to settling in wales

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:10.240
and becoming black citizens in an often unfriendly environment this is really important

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:16.880
because for those of us who are black but of mixed race

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:27.920
third generation nowadays and fourth and fifth generation the statement of intent made by those

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:39.200
people during and after the 1919 race riots after having been involved in world war one

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.600
and after a tremendous loss of life in world war one within their community

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:55.680
that statement is why we're citizens of wales today
