00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
Can you tell me some more about your father? What did he do for a living?

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.600
He was a grocer and he had a chain of shops in the valleys.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.600
So where were his shops then?

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:23.360
Oh, Eberveil, Merther, Bryn Maw, Blanavon and he did have two in the Midlands, in Kidderminster and Wolverhampton.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.760
How did he run all these shops? Did he have managers or...?

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.840
Yes, he did, but sadly in the war they were all called up, you see.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.840
So what happened then?

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.840
Well, some of them were closed, some were taken over.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.840
These were what, greengrocer's shops or what did they sell?

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.840
No, grocers.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.840
Grocer's shops.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.840
So they sold...

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.840
And in those days you didn't have anything in plastic, it was not known.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:59.920
And sugar, you have a big sack and I can remember these bags, blue bags, firm ones,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:08.920
and they used to scoop the sugar into the blue bags and I can see them now patting them down and folding them up.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.920
And the same with the butter.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.920
The butter didn't come in packets.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.000
You had a big slab of butter and these wooden sort of platter things and they used to cut them and they used to go like that, you know.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And then with the cheese, again, you had like a wire thing on a board and they cut through the cheese.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
But of course, butter and cheese were rationed in the war.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
You didn't have very much.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.080
The miners and manual workers, now they were given extra rations.
