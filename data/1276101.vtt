00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
Chapter 7, Glasgow. General strikes, workers and tanks.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.100
Strikes were also a massive problem for David Lloyd George in 1919.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:18.300
Some of those strikes were very, very significant, but there was a great number of strikes.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:26.600
The general strike in Glasgow started with racist violence.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:34.800
On the 23rd of January, Emmanuel Shinwell, then leader of the Glasgow branch of the Seafarers Union

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.600
and chairman of the Gladdow Trades and Labour Council, told a meeting of 600 white merchant-sail Navy sailors

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.300
that the reason they were finding it hard to find work was because of cheap Chinese labour.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.600
Later that day, sailors were waiting at the Mercantile Marine offices, hoping to sign on for a ship.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.400
There was a large group of white sailors and about 30 Sierra Leone seamen.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.000
This was the Brumelor riot, the first of the race riots in 2019.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.200
The 30 Sierra Leone men were chased to 118 Brumelor Street, a lodging house,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.500
where hundreds of merchant seamen attacked the house.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.700
But the men fought back and two attackers were injured, one stabbed, one shot.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.000
Sierra Leone seamen David Samuel and Tom Johnson were arrested for attempted murder.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.300
In an interview later, Shinwell blamed the black men for taking jobs.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.100
Strikes were happening all over Glasgow, and on the 27th of January,

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.400
the strike committee decided to announce a general strike.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.900
Flying pickets were sent to those places not yet on strike.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.200
Many of those pickets were ex-servicemen, some still in army grey coats.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.600
All of Clydeside was involved and miners in Stirlingshire.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.600
At first, the police were used to intimidate the strikers and drive them off the streets.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:20.400
But on Bloody Friday, January 31st, fighting broke out at a rally in George Square.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:28.700
What sparked off the fight is unclear, although it's generally attributed to the police trying to stop a tram from being immobilised,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.100
a technique that was being used by the strikers.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.000
In any case, the police had orders to use their batons that day.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.100
And if the tramway incident had not provided a justification for their attack, then another pretext would have been found.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.300
Trade union leader Gallagher describes the attack.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.200
Suddenly, without warning of any kind, a signal was given,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.800
and the police made a savage and totally unexpected assault on the rear of the meeting,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.500
smashing right and left with their batons, utterly regardless of whom or what they hit.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.100
With brutal ferocity, they made their onslaught on defenceless workers.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.700
But the police got more than they bargained for that day.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.900
Pitch battles took place in the square and the surrounded streets.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:24.300
Charge after charge by the police was driven off under a hail of bricks and bottles until the police were forced to retreat.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.400
The government now sent in the army.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.900
And literally, the government had hesitated to take this step because of fear of possible mutiny,

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.100
because the army itself was not properly under their control.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.100
At a meeting of the War Cabinet held January 30th,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:54.200
General Charles had pointed out in the pre-war years we had a well-disciplined and ignorant army,

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.300
whereas we now have an army educated and ill-disciplined.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.100
An interesting quote.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.900
But the defeat of the police put an end to the government's hesitation.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:11.800
Thousands of troops, fully equipped, poured into Glasgow late on the night of Bloody Friday and early Saturday morning.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:26.800
Accompanied by heavy munitions wagons, the general appearance of long columns of khaki-led men suggest that at least the government is in earnest in the measures to crush the new revolutionary spirit,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.400
wrote the Glasgow Evening News.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.200
Howitzers were positioned in the city chambers.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.000
The cattle market was transformed into a tank depot.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.500
Machine guns were posted on the top of hotels.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:53.200
And the main post office and armed troops stood sentry outside power stations and patrolled the streets.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:05:04.200
Apart from preparing new laws, the government also used the existing ones to carry out a decision made at the War Cabinet meeting of June 31st.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.100
They arrested the strike leaders to weaken the strike movement.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:15.200
The next day, union leaders Gallacher and Kirkwood were arrested while trying to stop the fighting in George Square.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.200
And in the following days, the rioting was used as an excuse to pick up other leaders, including Shinwell.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:30.500
Everett, the National Secretary of the Marxist-British Socialist Party, and Hopkins, Glasgow's Secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.300
The press, supporting the government, jumped on board.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:45.600
The Glasgow Herald put the strike down to the clap-trap nonsense of Trotsky and the studious inculcation of the temper of revolt.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:06:01.100
And described its leaders as a gang of political revolutionaries who have contrived to exploit the industrial weariness of Scottish workers, notorious rebels against the social order.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.700
Terrorism on the Clyde proclaimed one headline in the Scotsman.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:13.500
And Glasgow Bolshevism, disgraceful scenes, proclaimed another in the Evening News.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:21.300
Over an article which claims the troops have been sent in to protect life and property from the rebel.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:39.100
The Glasgow strike was broken and the strike leaders were all taken to court after tanks and howitzers in the main square and across Glasgow.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:59.800
The central argument for the strike was the workers wanted a reduction not from 54 to 47 hours a week as the trade union congress had agreed with government, but down to a 40 hour week.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:09.800
And the reason they wanted a 40 hour week was to ensure that more unemployed people would be in work.
