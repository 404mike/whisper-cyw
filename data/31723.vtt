00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Another Mary, you're the one

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I'm your baby, every mother's son

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And alone in the dark, in the heart of my heart

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I can still feel your arms around me

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Through the mud and the pain and the blistering rain

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Of the shell-shattered shock that surrounds me

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
All the love in your eyes when we said our goodbyes

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Like a king you sceptered and crowned me

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And I'm holding on tight like an infant to see you again

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:30.000
La la la la...

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Yes, I'm holding on tight like an infant to see you again

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Sister Stacey

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I'm the man

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Try and stop me

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Gotta do what I can

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I'm an anti-grim reaper gun talking peacekeeper

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
A hero with stripes on my shoulders

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
A travel war man with the world at command

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And the tales to tell when I'm older

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And the work that we do when it's all done for you

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And without us your world would be colder

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And I'm holding on tight like a brother to see you again

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:54.000
La la la la la la la la la la la la

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I'm holding on tight like a brother to see you again

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:15.760
Darling, you're the one

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:30.160
I keep my babies safe and warm

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.600
Don't know when I'll be home, now I'm roaming alone

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.120
In a world of tomorrow and maybe

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.480
And I miss you each day, and I need you to say

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.240
You're my safe haven, goddess and lady

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.760
Cause I pray every night, what I'm doing is right

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.440
I can keep the world safe as a baby

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.320
And I'm holding on tight like a lover

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:19.280
To see you again

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.160
Oh, I'm holding on tight like a lover

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.560
To see you again

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.200
I'm holding on tight like a brother

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.200
To see you again

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.920
Oh, I'm holding on tight like an infant

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:45.120
To see you again
