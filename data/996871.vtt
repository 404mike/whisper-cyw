00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.600
The Lord, my shepherd, I'll not want, He makes me down to lie.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:41.600
In master's dream He leadeth me The quiet waters wide.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:59.600
I saw the earth restore a year, And need to walk that day,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:19.600
Within the bounds of righteousness, Before His own name say.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:38.600
Even though I walk through Westarkville, Yet will I feel the hill,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:57.600
For the heart with me can by God, And set me come for still.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:17.600
My field of grass that perishes, In presence of my God,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:39.600
My head of grass, with all life and life, Can by the fulcrum flow.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:59.600
Goodness and mercy, all my life, Shall surely follow me,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:20.600
And in God's love forevermore, Like wedding plates shall be.
