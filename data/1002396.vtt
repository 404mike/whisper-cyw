00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Thank you Martha. We will now stand and sing. No, we have an invocation.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I want to get that started.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
May we please stand for the invocation prayer to God.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Almighty and ever living God, our loving Heavenly Father,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
we gather here to remember the saving grace of Christ,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
working through your faithful servants to our ancestors of nation and family.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We thank you for the victories over Satan that they won on our behalf,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and they were forerunners of faith and courage, of loyalty and goodness,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
leaving us with traditions that are great and wonderful.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We thank you for all that those who have gone before have done on our behalf,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and of the great blessing that comes to us through their efforts,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
through their faith, and from your hand.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Now as we gather here today to remember our past,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
we thank you also for the blessings we enjoy from your hand upon our lives at this time.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
We open our hearts and spirits to worship and adore you.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And we pray that this afternoon the spirit of the joy of Christ may be upon us,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
the spirit of gratitude may be ours,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and that our joy, our music, our gratitude may be expressed in ways that are pleasing to you

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and beneficial to all of us.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We pray in Jesus' name, Amen.
