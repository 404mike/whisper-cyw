00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
Hello, I'm Peter Fullerton, the chair of Friends of Cardiff reservoirs, and I'm sitting here

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.760
on a glorious, still sunny morning in November, interviewing Anne Barrett, who used to run

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.400
the sailing school here.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.080
So, how did you first get involved with the reservoir and the sailing school?

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.200
I first got involved at the reservoir probably around 1979, where a friend of mine had done

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.400
some sailing and said, why don't you come up and just come out on the water?

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.040
So I did, and I have to admit, firstly, I really didn't like it.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.480
I came from a sports background.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.440
I could do sports.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.440
Sailing was one of these things.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.400
Oh, you have to learn things.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.480
But I persevered with some encouragement from the current principal at the time, a gentleman

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.880
called Jim Dunn and the then chief instructor, Francis Hurley, and basically did all my qualifications,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.680
got involved with volunteering, and then sadly Jim Dunn, he died.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:11.560
Francis Hurley became the principal, and within quite a few, well, within a few years, I became

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.000
the chief instructor.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.760
So basically, I learned at Lanishen, I volunteered at Lanishen, I then worked at Lanishen, and

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.280
then in the end, I finally became the principal of Lanishen, and I then retired from the sport

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.000
Only a couple of years before then, the sailing centre moved to Cardiff Bay.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.680
So how long were you here to recharge to the sailing centre?

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:44.840
I was here in all capacities for cool, 99, 2009, 35 years in all capacities.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.840
I came back until the centre moved in 2010.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.960
I on and off remained in contact with many people who learned to sail here, who became

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.800
friends, and also in contact with people who learned to sail and then went on to bigger

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.600
and better things around the world.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.920
And it's quite interesting that a lot of sailors who started here are still involved in the

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.680
sport in various capacities, well, every corner of the world, really.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.160
Any in particular you remember that went through the school?

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.880
I think it's very difficult.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.080
There's been a lot of children who learned when they were little, in little oppies, who've

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.960
gone on to great things.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.840
Yes, everyone mentions Hannah Mills, who I'm still in contact with and has done great things,

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:45.760
double Olympic champion, world champion, flag bearer for Team GB at Tokyo, recently skipper

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.200
of the Athena Pathway America's Cup boat in the first ever women's America's Cup.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.480
But there are a lot of other people.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.360
Hannah is just the name that people possibly recognise.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.400
But a lot of people are working in the business around the world and making a difference from

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:12.740
working on super yachts to running sailing schools in Greece to becoming quite high profile

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.820
environmentalists.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:22.820
Emily Penn years ago was one of the first to introduce or make awareness of microplastics.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.780
A guy called Rob Hobson is now quite a high profile nutritionalist.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:37.460
So there are so many really that I admire for, I feel privileged that I taught them

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.700
and for the people that they've become, many are in all sorts of quite high ranking jobs

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.700
around the world.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.340
And I've said that learning to sail and becoming instructors played a part in allowing them

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.620
to pursue totally different careers.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.540
And could you describe to me what a sort of typical day for you was like when you were

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.140
running the sailing school?

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.100
Because there was lots of boats here.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.700
You meet people here who have been through the sailing school and they remember it quite

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.700
fondly.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.260
But for you, what was a day like when you were running the school?

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.180
Every day was slightly different.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:22.020
But if you look at, I don't know, let's pick a random day in July.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:29.060
Still in term time, I would start work probably about 7.30, just walk around the site.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.260
Again, I was very privileged at 7.30 in the morning.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.900
I'm the only one here apart from maybe the occasional kingfisher and the swans who regularly

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.540
visited on the little pond we had for our environmental studies group.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.620
So I would come in at 7.30, the staff would come in at 8.30.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.740
All the boats would be prepared then for whatever classes would come up.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.180
Invariably in term time, that would be schools groups.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.300
We taught a lot of primary schools.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:03.460
We ran an oppie roadshow program which taught 1500 children in a month, two hour sessions,

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:11.740
learning to rig oppies, learn about knots, water safety, have a session on the water.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.700
So you would do that for most of the day.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.100
Then there'd be a slight break and then evening classes would come in depending on what day

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.100
of the week it was.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.740
There would be adult courses running.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:26.780
The day would then sail in toppers, lasers, wayfarers.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.060
And that would then run until nine.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.740
So my average day would be a 7.30 till about quarter past nine.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.700
And then if it was an adult group, you have to do forced to do the social thing of go

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:42.020
to the pub for a few beers and discuss in great detail the session on the water.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.420
So it was just a debrief session.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:54.260
We ran children's groups, which was mainly in the days and on Saturdays and Sundays.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.860
Then they were fantastically successful.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.460
And my favorite session was a Saturday morning where kids had learned to sail and then they

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.980
just wanted to improve.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:09.460
And we were lucky that we had a big, big fleet of boats that really could cater for from

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.020
eight year olds to senior adults.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:20.260
Although we didn't have specifically disabled boats, we jury rigged up something and make

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.260
it work.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.580
And that was one of the best things that we ever did here was that we were very, very

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.700
inclusive before it became the thing to do and tick a box.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.060
We never tick boxes.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.820
We wanted to be totally inclusive.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:40.300
If you wanted to get on the water by hook or by crook and sometimes by breaking rules,

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.700
we got you out there.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:48.060
It was one of the greatest things and one of my proudest things to have achieved, to

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.300
make it as accessible as it could.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:57.420
And that was probably at one point we were teaching almost every school in Cardiff at

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:03.060
one point in my tenure here came to sail at Anshan.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.140
When you see it now, it's open to the public and some water sport activities happening.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.340
How do you feel about the reservoir now coming back?

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.340
It's very difficult.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.620
It was a difficult time when the sailing centre moved to the bay.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:25.500
For me, Anshan, its location, the water quality was perfect.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.620
When coming back to the reservoir now, it's open to the public.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.100
What are your feelings about it now?

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.100
It's really difficult.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:38.660
Obviously, it was a sad time when the sailing centre had to move to Cardiff Bay because

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.500
of the possibility of development.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:48.300
And there's no doubt it's still in my mind, clinician, is one of the best locations certainly

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:53.580
anywhere in Wales for people to come and live water sports.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.580
It's twofold.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.340
The site has been developed remarkably well.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:02.980
I could never have imagined having worked for all those years in a couple of pre-First

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:09.940
World War huts with no money to see the facilities that are available now.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:15.860
I think it's magnificent to be able to walk around there if you want to get a cup of coffee.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.580
So the facilities are absolutely fabulous.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:25.820
I think if I look at it with my principal hat on, then I think there's a lot of work

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:35.740
to be done as far as making it a highly successful water sports facility.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:42.180
So there's a lot of work, I think, to be done there to make it anywhere near the centre

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.140
that it was when I was there.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:52.220
Blowing my own trumpet a little bit, at one time we were undoubtedly the most successful

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.900
sailing centre anywhere in the country, and that's the UK.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:02.780
No one could compete with what we were doing, the numbers that we had in attendance and

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:03.860
the success rate.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:10.740
And that doesn't necessarily mean Olympic success.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.740
That's a one-off.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:17.820
That's luck and down to the individual, not down to the centre.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:25.100
So I think if they work hard at it, then it could be something special, but I think

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.900
there's a long way to go.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.900
But as someone who comes and walks, it's brilliant.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:30.900
That's great.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:31.900
Well, thank you very much.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:32.900
I'm pleased to be sharing this.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:33.900
My pleasure.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:34.900
Thank you.
