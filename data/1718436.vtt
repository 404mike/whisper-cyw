00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500
25, 26 years now I've been running the night hike. Mark Evans might know better

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.180
because he was seven and went on the first night hike and he's got his own

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:16.740
children now. So it was designed, so I used to do a lot with the kids then I

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.860
wasn't married and we go sledging and just go off having fun and I decided

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.380
that I would do something a bit more interesting with them on New Year's Eve

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.140
and devised this night hike and the very first walk I can remember we went over

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.700
the field on what's now is part of the Millennium Walkway which we created

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.260
which is over the field through the stile and up through the the woods there

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.540
and I remember bearing in mind this is a lot of farm kids and village kids I hid

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.140
a sheep skull at face height in a tree so that when walking through the path it

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.220
might startle the children and they didn't bat an eyelid. Seen plenty of

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.340
those and so I've been doing it every year ever since without fail and it's

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.660
great fun and we now have sausages and a campfire and I think you've been on

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.820
them so I'm rather proud that I've done that and that's a lasting memory.
