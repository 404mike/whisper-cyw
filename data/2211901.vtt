00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240
So my first question to you is can you tell me about your experience of coming to Wales?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.960
Well, as you know, I was born and raised in Guyana. I initially came to the United Kingdom in 2021 to work in the NHS.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.920
When I landed I

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.720
wasn't meant to come to Wales.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.480
I started out in Liverpool, but I met my husband and

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.800
I moved to Wales. We got married and then I moved to Wales.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.440
So that's how I ended up in Wales.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.160
Take your time, take your time. I'll just give you, you know, some time to zoom back in.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:04.320
As I would have mentioned when we had the workshop, I learned about Wales

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:11.560
through my granddad because he had a slate with the Welsh dragon on it.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.160
And that's how I learned about Wales. So when I moved to Wales, you know, I was quite happy.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
I remembered, you know, that little

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.720
moment we had when I was a child about Wales.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.720
Yeah.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.720
Yeah, I think it's really interesting that you had that slate.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.720
Yeah.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.720
Why he had that or how he had that?

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.720
Because Guyana was once a British colony.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.720
They did a lot of trade in between the Caribbean, South America and the UK.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.720
So

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.720
back then they weren't any

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.720
white boards or chalk boards. They used slates to

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.720
write, to take notes in school.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:58.720
So I would assume that it came from this part, this part of the world for them to use there in schools because

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.720
he went to a Catholic school and I think it was run by some missionaries from the UK.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.720
So I guess that's where he got it from.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.720
Were they still using those slates when you were in school or was it something different?

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.720
No, it was totally different.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.720
I think they got rid of them sometime in the early 80s.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.720
No, when I went to school, they were books.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.720
Yeah, books.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:36.720
Did he tell you much about how it was to use the slate or did you just inherit it sort of without any stories attached to it?

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.720
Just a little story.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.720
He just mentioned that he used it in the early 80s.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.720
He just mentioned that he used it in school and the school that he went to, it was under like a house

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.720
because the house was high but there was no enclosure at the bottom because I don't know if you're familiar with

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:11.720
Caribbean houses but what they were like in the 70s, 80s, 90s, it was just the upper part but the lower part, it was completely open.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:20.720
It was mostly like that to hold functions like schools, church and any other function.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:29.720
He just mentioned that there was an organization that had a little school under a house and that's what they used to take notes.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:40.720
He was quite a bit of a hoarder so he had loads of bits and pieces from his early life.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.720
And then you said that when you had it, you turned it out round and it was the Welsh Dragon on the back.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.720
Yes, there was the Welsh Dragon on the back.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:03.720
I didn't know what it was and then he told me, you know, that's from the United Kingdom, maybe one day you'll get there.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:12.720
I didn't quite understand what he meant by that at that time because I was just about six years old and here I am today.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.720
Was that an aspiration for people, do you think, getting to?

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.720
It is. It still is in all fairness.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:35.720
Especially if you grew up the way I did with very little opportunities, it's kind of your benchmark for your career, your professional life,

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:44.720
to eventually study and migrate so that you can, in hopes that you can give your family a better life because there are not much opportunities

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.720
even though we're still a developing country and you would think that things are better.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.720
Things are, in a sense, better from the eight seventies and the eighties and the nineties.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:04.720
But, you know, it's still the benchmark. You go to secondary school, you go to university and then you migrate.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.720
That's interesting, isn't it, about how, yeah.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.720
It is. It is quite interesting.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.720
It's part of the story of success, I think.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.720
Yeah.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:26.720
I wonder if you could or if you'd feel comfortable telling me about what home means to you now.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.720
Going back home is not an option for me.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:37.720
Home, it's really where my heart is, but in reality I don't think that I can return.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.720
There's just not a life there for me anymore.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:47.720
Like I would have mentioned, the benchmark, you know, we go to school and we strive to leave.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.720
As early as possible.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.720
So it's a case whereby going back home for me will mean that I'm regressing.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.720
And I think for me, it'll feel like I'm, like I failed.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.720
Is there anything more you can tell me about that?

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:16.720
Yeah, because I, let me put it this way, I am the first in my family to have a tertiary education.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:24.720
And there is a, you know, I'm not the only one who has a degree in the university.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.720
I'm the only one who has a degree in the university.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.720
I am the first in my family to have a tertiary education.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:41.720
And there is a, there are high expectations for me.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:51.720
So if I go back home, it will, I'll be disappointing a lot of people.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:57.720
I don't have, I don't have the option of going back home.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.720
To start my life there again.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:07.720
So that's me being honest, because they've my, I lost my dad when I was eight.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.720
And my mom, she didn't have a tertiary education.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.720
She didn't, she didn't even have a secondary education.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.720
She just went up to primary school because of her life, you know, and my grandparents, they were quite poor.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.720
She had to quit school quite early to help with the family.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.720
And she never got the opportunity to go back.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.720
So she made sure that I got a proper education so that I can look after the family.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.720
So I'm basically looking after my family back home.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:40.720
So home, well, it would mean a lot to me to go back and continue my life there.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.720
It's simply not possible.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.720
Thank you for sharing that.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.720
I think it's important to hear those kind of complex reasons, you know,

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:57.720
and complex kind of stories and pressures that, you know, you're carrying.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.720
So thank you for sharing a bit more about that.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.720
I wonder if you can describe a place or a time in your life that's important to you.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:15.720
Oh, it was the day I finished, finished nursing school, finished university

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:29.720
and found out that I'd passed my state finals to get my license because I struggled through uni when I was doing my degree to become a nurse.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.720
And there were all sorts of challenges financially.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:38.720
You know, I had just gotten out of a really abusive relationship as well.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.720
And I was, you know, getting myself together, you know, healing from that.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.720
So I really struggled.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:51.720
And at one point, I thought, you know, I would make it out, you know, be another statistic.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:09:00.720
And I, I, I found out that I passed.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.720
It was the 14th of February 2014.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.720
I found out I had that bit of information.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:16.720
And I was really happy because I know that would have been my turning point.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:25.720
So I would have been, I would be able to provide for my family and subsequently be able to move.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.720
So that that really, really stands out to me.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.720
I always carry that in my heart.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.720
Yeah.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.720
Sounds like a big achievement.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.720
It has been very proud.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.720
Yeah.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.720
How long after that did you move to Liverpool?

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:53.720
2021, quite a few years after, because part of my training, it was funded by the government.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.720
And I was contractually obligated to them for five years.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.720
So I had to start my contract.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.720
And then I was free.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.720
As soon as I was free, I was out.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.720
How old were you when you, when you came here?

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.720
I was just turned 30 in June.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.720
Yeah, 30.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.720
So not very old at all.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.720
No.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:28.720
Speaking of age, I wonder if you feel comfortable telling me a bit about your childhood.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.720
Yeah, sure.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:37.720
I grew up in a really small rural community, just outside of the capital city of Georgetown.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.720
I am the only child for my mom and dad.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.720
My dad had two other kids that were older than me.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.720
I have two sisters.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.720
I really had a simple childhood.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.720
We weren't rich.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.720
We weren't.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.720
We were quite poor.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:58.720
And my dad, he was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to go to university.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.720
He was a civil engineer, but he passed early.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.720
He died of leukemia.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.720
So it was just my mom and I for a really, really long time.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.720
And it was quite simple, even though we didn't have much.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.720
It was, it was lovely.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.720
I had lots of friends.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.720
I had a roof over my head.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:29.720
I had food and I went to school and I did exceptionally well in school, not to brag.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.720
I did really well in school.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.720
So that was a plus.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:38.720
But, you know, and I read a lot when I was four years old.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:44.720
The first my first memory of my dad is him getting me a book when I was four years old.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.720
And I still have it to this day.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.720
So I read early.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.720
I was one of those children that read really early.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.720
So I was always fond of reading.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.720
So where we lived, there wasn't a library in the community.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.720
So there was one in the neighboring village.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:06.720
So my mom would allow me to walk once every other week to go get books from the library.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.720
So reading kept me out of trouble.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:14.720
It kept me grounded and it took me places, you know.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.720
So, yeah, I had a really good childhood.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:23.720
My teenage years weren't, you know, that that good.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.720
I had a baby at 16.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.720
So I have a 17 year old daughter.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.720
And even though I had a child, I was still supported by my mom.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:40.720
So I supported and encouraged to continue my education, which I did.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:47.720
I subsequently graduated secondary school and I did exceptionally well at the Caribbean Council exams.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.720
I sat nine subjects and I got all grade ones.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.720
So I was able to get into sixth form.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:03.720
So I was a statistic in every sense, but I I overcame those those hurdles.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:08.720
I went to sixth form at one of the most prestigious secondary schools in the country.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.720
It's called Queens College.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:16.720
And I sat for subjects and I got all four A's.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.720
I always wanted to be a nurse.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.720
And that's owing to the fact that my dad spent a lot of time in the hospital.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.720
And my mom used to take me every Sunday.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.720
We'd go to visit him because he spent like weeks, sometimes months in the hospital.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.720
I wasn't allowed to go during the week school time.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.720
So she would take me every Sunday.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.720
And I quite admired the way the nurses looked after him.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.720
And I said, you know what, that's what I want to do with my life when I'm older.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.720
So I had this in my head.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.720
I want to be a nurse.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.720
And in order for me to be a nurse, I need to focus.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.720
I need to take my education seriously.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.720
I did just that.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:14:00.720
So my after I completed my sixth form, I actually started teaching.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.720
I was a primary school teacher, but I didn't like it at all.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.720
It wasn't something that I wanted to do.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.720
It was just, you know, a way to make a bit of money at that time.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:17.720
Because getting into university to do nursing was really hard in the early 2000s.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:24.720
So I did encounter a few challenges while, you know, trying to get into nursing school.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:30.720
So instead of sitting at home because I had a child to look after as well, I decided to teach.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.720
I did that for quite some time and I didn't like it.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.720
And then an opportunity, a little window opened itself for me to get into nursing school.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.720
And I did.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.720
But I had a lovely childhood.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.720
I can't come except for losing my dad.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:53.720
I think my childhood was relatively normal and quite fun.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.720
You said you liked reading.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.720
What things did you like to read?

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.720
Yeah, I like I do love a good mystery.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.720
My dad was in my dad was fond of Western books.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.720
So I did, you know, dabble a little in that.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.720
But it wasn't, you know, the genre that I liked.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.720
So I ended up, you know, into mystery.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:19.720
I started off, you know, as a teen, I'd go read all the Nancy Drew books, Hardy Boys and the library.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.720
And, you know, I just loved reading.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.720
I just love reading.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.720
Is it something you still get to do now?

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:32.720
I, you know, honestly, haven't read much since I moved here in the UK.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:38.720
I've been busy with work and I started my master's degree program, but I had to pause that.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:47.720
So I haven't I've just lost all motivation, you know, to read.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:54.720
So now that I have another little one, another little one, I'm going to I've started reading to her again.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:02.720
So I'm, you know, trying to get back into the swing of reading and, you know, falling in love with it all over again.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.720
Sounds great. Sounds like an important part of you.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.720
It is. It is quite because it reminds me so much of my dad.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:15.720
That because the first book that he got me, he used to work quite late and I used to wait up at night.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:20.720
Even though my mom would send me off to bed, I'd say, you know, I'm waiting on my dad.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:25.720
And he'd come home and no matter how tired he was, he'd still read me a story.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:32.720
And I did that with my eldest. No matter how tired I was, I'd get home and I'd read her a story.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.720
And I started reading for her from the same book and she loves reading as well.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:41.720
So I think it's something I really want to pass on to my other child.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.720
I'm sure you will. Great role modeling with readings.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.720
Anything else you'd like to tell us about your childhood or growing up?

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:57.720
Well, like I said, it was relatively calm and simple. I had lots of fun.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:05.720
I didn't have any siblings close by because my other two sisters lived away with their mom.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:10.720
And that's basically it. It was just simple.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:16.720
It was just a simple upbringing, simple childhood.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.720
Thank you for sharing about that.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:27.720
You've talked about one time or moment that was important when you got your nursing qualifications.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:32.720
But my next question is, can you tell me about a magic moment when something changed for you?

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.720
I wonder if there's something else.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.720
Oh, I can't think of anything.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:57.720
I think it was coming here because it was something out of, you know, something out.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:06.720
In my mind, it was something out of a novel because I never expected to get this far.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:18.720
So all the while I was going through the process to get my visa and come here, I was still a bit in denial, still a bit shocked.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.720
But then I got when I landed at Manchester Airport, it felt surreal.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:27.720
It felt I would like to say magical.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:34.720
And I felt, you know, I've accomplished something and I was really, really proud, proud of myself.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.720
Yeah, I can't think of anything. I really can't think of anything else.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:49.720
That's a great moment. Like you say, that feeling of achievement and being proud of yourself.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.720
Yeah.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.720
That's definitely a magic moment.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:59.720
Can you can you remember anything more about about how it felt and that pride you felt about what you've done?

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.720
Yeah, I.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:24.720
For me, it was while it was a magical moment for me, it was also bittersweet for my family back home because I was leaving and I left my eldest back home because I wasn't I wasn't sure what I was coming into here.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.720
So, yeah, that that's that's it.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.720
My next question is about hopes for the future.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:36.720
She is she's she's quite accomplished as well for her age and she wants to be a doctor.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:41.720
So I'm looking forward to that. I know she'll do it. I am supporting her.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:46.720
Another thing is I am I would love to complete my master's degree.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:53.720
So that's one of my hope for the future. And I'd like to write one of these days.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.720
I haven't shared this with anybody for a really long time.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:09.720
But my my one of my, you know, little dream is to write to be an author and to teach but in nursing education.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:14.720
That's my you know, one of one of the things that I'm looking forward to the future.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.720
Just having a nice simple life.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.720
I don't want a lot.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.720
I don't want a lot.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.720
Just sound like beautiful dreams.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.720
And I'm sure you're going to achieve them.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.720
I think you'd be a great writer.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.720
You have an aptitude for storytelling.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.720
Just a little bit I've I've heard.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.720
Yeah. Yeah.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.720
What when you say you'd like to teach, why is that?

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.720
What excites you about that?

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:54.720
I think the excitement comes from the fact that I've had loads of great teachers and they've imparted a lot in me.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.720
They've supported me even when I was pregnant.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:07.720
One particular teacher I remember in secondary school, she came to me and she said, we all know that you're pregnant.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.720
We could see it even though you're trying to hide it.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.720
But I just want you to know that we love you and we support you.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.720
And I carry those words with me even now.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:25.720
And, you know, sometimes when I'm having a really, really rough time and I'm reflecting on all that I've been through, those words, they tend to echo.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:31.720
And I'd like to be able to, you know, I would like to be able to be that for somebody.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:36.720
And I have been told that I'm really, really good at teaching.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:43.720
I can sit and explain something to somebody in, you know, in great details, you know, to get them to understand.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:49.720
And I think that'd be beneficial to, you know, the nursing profession.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:57.720
So since I'm already in it, you know, just venture down the education path.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:01.720
That sounds brilliant. And is it the masters that can help you to get it?

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.720
It is the masters that can help me.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.720
That sounds like a beautiful plan.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.720
I think you'll be a fantastic teacher.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.720
Thank you.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.720
Yeah.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:23.720
Are there any other hopes or aspirations for the future that you'd like to share with us before we go on to the next?

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:29.720
No, my life is a bit dull.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.720
I just want the little simple things.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:38.720
Yeah. Yeah. And you deserve that too.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:54.720
OK. My last question is, is there anything else, either going back to the questions we've already been through or other things that you feel like you would like to share or that you think is important for people to know about your story?

00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:04.720
Yeah, I'd just like to leave this bit of this, you know, I'd like to think of myself as a positive person, looking back at all that I've been through in my life.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:20.720
I've always remained positive. And whomever my story might reach to, I hope that, you know, they can use my story and be inspired, be motivated to keep pressing on despite the odds.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.720
It's really beautiful. Thank you.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.720
Thank you.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:29.720
OK. So is there anything else you'd like to share? Otherwise we can start wrapping up and get back to you.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.720
I think that's it.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.720
OK. It's just a beautiful interview. Thank you so much.
