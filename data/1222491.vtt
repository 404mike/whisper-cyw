00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
Were you aware of people coming into the town centre from the valleys when you were growing up?

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.600
Yes, every Thursday afternoon they came in, because it was half day closing up the valleys.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:19.600
And they came in on Thursday afternoons to shop and they came in on the Taft station.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.600
It's called Queenstead station now.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.200
And opposite the Taft station on the other side of Newport Road was the old Rumley station.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.200
Do you remember that one?

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.200
It's called the Rumley station, R-H-Y-M-N-E-Y.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.200
Because the line still comes down.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.200
It's like at the end of the parade.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.200
You know you had one end coming into City Road, the other end and you crossed over sort of thing.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.800
It was that way.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.800
And that used to be also for the Taft station and the Rumley Halt.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.800
It used to be all for the valleys.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:12.800
Anything else like Newport, London, Cheltenham, Bridgend, you all went to the Tardig General.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.800
They're still there, it's amazing.
