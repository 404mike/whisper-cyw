I'm Stephanie and it's the 21st of July 2019 and I'm up in the Ellen Valley visitor centre

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.520
and I'm talking to Jean. Jean, what are your memories of the 1969 moon landing?

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.960
Well, the thing I remember was that it was all very, very exciting and everybody was wondering

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:24.080
whether a baby would be born on that day. My son was a week overdue and I'd already started in

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.360
labour and I was like sitting there watching the moon landing wondering which thing was going to

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:38.320
happen first and in fact he wasn't born until the next day. But we met somebody a few years ago

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.080
who lived next door to us and that was all she remembered about living next door to us,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.800
that we nearly had a baby born the day they landed on the moon and he's now of course 50

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.680
tomorrow. So he's having a party today. So that's really why I recorded it because it isn't particularly

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:05.440
exciting but it's just quite interesting of how excited everybody was at the time

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.720
because the papers were full of all these babies who were born on that day.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.160
Do you remember anything about the fashion and the music at the time?

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.760
No, not really. I mean, I know miniskirts were in and there's a Mary Quant exhibition I think in

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.320
London but because I was very, very pregnant I wasn't really wearing a miniskirt.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.560
So, Jean, that's brilliant. Thank you so much.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.480
Thank you. Thanks very much.
