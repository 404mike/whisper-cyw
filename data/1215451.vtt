So you work here at People First. Are there people that you've met through your work

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.000
that you would consider a friend at all or that you get on with?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.640
There is one person that I have made an effort to make friends with

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.440
and she seems to be a really, really nice person, a nice friend.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:37.600
And yes, I have found one person and she's very similar to me, so I'm happy for her to be my friend.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.120
How would you describe yourself when you say you want somebody like you? What would they be like?

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:55.920
Likes to go out, obviously meeting people. Likes to go to the cinema for meals and just have fun.
