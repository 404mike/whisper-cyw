00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
How is it?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Right.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:19.880
This is Jill Jones talking to Phyllis Brown about Gwynfryn Village and Minera Quarry and

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.880
Gwynfryn School.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.880
Hello, good afternoon Phyllis.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.880
Hello.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:32.760
Now would you like to start this by giving your name and date of birth please.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.480
Oh dear, yes.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.960
Well my name is Phyllis Brown and I am 93 years old.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.960
I was born in 1926.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.960
Right.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.360
And I lived in Gwynfryn.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.360
I was born in Gwynfryn.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.360
Yes.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:57.840
And I was born in Estedford Cossages which are one of the long houses, the old long houses

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.840
that the people had.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:09.840
The house itself belonged to the line works, to the quarry, people of the quarry which

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.840
my father rented.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.840
And what else was there?

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.320
Yes, so that's up at the top of Gwynfryn Village and these days looks into the quarry

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.320
a little bit.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.320
It's at the head of a footpath that goes down into the workings.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.320
That's right.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.320
Yes.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.320
I can remember living there of course and going down that little track that you're

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.320
talking about down to the village because my father worked in the quarry.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:49.800
It was very hard work because at the time the money was very poor because he only had

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:57.800
– he didn't earn more than £2 a week while he was working.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:07.800
And yes, he went down that path and we were sent down with tea for him when he was working.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.280
So that's just the part that I remember going down to the quarry itself.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.280
Yes.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:26.280
The little cottage we had of course had no electricity so we had to go out through the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.280
gate and across the moors to carry water.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:39.760
We also had rainwater stored and we had to go all the way to the village, to Gwynfryn

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.760
Village to buy goods, to buy food.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.760
Yes, so there was – I remember a post office in Gwynfryn Village.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.760
Yes, that was in the one little store that was there.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.760
That's it, the Pentra.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.760
Yes.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.240
There was another shop at the top of Bryn Maddock Road.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.240
Ah yes, that's right, Sills Shop.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.240
That would be quite a long way to walk.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.240
Yes, quite a way.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.240
Well, if you lived in Stadford it would be.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.240
Yes, a good mile.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.240
Because you've got to remember the extra walk up there.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.240
True.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.240
Yes.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.720
So, did you go to school in Gwynfryn?

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.720
Yes, I went to school in Gwynfryn.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:38.720
We went down through the village and over Pennwar Hill down to the bottom where the

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.720
school was located.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:50.720
It was one building, one open space which was divided into three classrooms with sort

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.720
of petitions and so on.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.200
That's it, yes.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.200
Yes, it was quite good.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.200
I remember being there.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.200
Yes.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:11.200
And then I went from there down to the grammar school at age 11, you know, usual times.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.200
Oh yes, so you went to Grove Park, did you?

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:23.680
Yes, so I went to Grove Park and eventually I did train to teach.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.680
Yes.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.680
I went to all sorts of small schools around in what was then Denbighshire, still is Denbighshire

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.680
I think.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.680
But I did stay in Gwynfryn for a while.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.680
I remember the children there.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.680
Yes.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:53.160
I went to all sorts of little schools around the old Denbighshire which was interesting

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.160
really.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.160
Yes.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.160
But quite a way to travel every day.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160
Yes, yes.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.160
So when you travelled to the other schools it was with the local bus services.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.160
Yes, the local bus services, yes.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.640
Yes, so Edward's buses went all the way up to Rithyn and most of the schools I went to

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.640
were within reach of Rithyn or somehow or other else I had to get another bus from there,

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.640
you know, a bit further.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.640
Yes, yes.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.640
That sounds very interesting.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.640
Well.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.640
Yes.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:36.640
So while I think about it, was your first language Welsh language?

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.640
Yes, Welsh.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.120
Yes, my first language is Welsh.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.120
Yes.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.120
Because the Gwynfryn School was actually built as a Welsh school.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.120
Yes.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.120
It was known as the Council, Minera Council School.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.120
That's correct.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.120
As opposed to Minera Church School down the road which was all English.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.120
Yes.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:07.120
And yes, that's why they did, my mother went to that school and of course she had more

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.600
English, she was taught more English than Welsh really.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.600
Yes.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.600
Yes.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.600
Yes.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.600
Yes.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.600
My grandmother was, my other grandmother, not my Roger's grandmother, my other grandmother

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:27.600
was appointed the first caretaker cleaner of that school at the princely sum of £12

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.600
I think a year.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.600
Oh my goodness.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.600
Yes, it was a beautiful letter.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.600
Yes.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.600
A beautiful letter, yes.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.080
Oh, so an official letter of appointment.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.080
Yes, that's right.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.080
That sounds really good.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.080
Yes, very good.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.080
I thought you'd be interested in that letter.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.080
Yes, that sounds good.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.080
So, how long were you teaching then, Phyllis?

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.080
Oh, well I did my 40 years altogether.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:05.080
That's the requisite amount you're expected to work.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.080
Yes, it is.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.560
Yes.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.560
Yes.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.560
So, and moving around you'd meet a lot of people.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.560
Yes, you do.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.560
You do see all sorts of people.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.560
It's strange, isn't it?

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:25.560
I ended up in Brumbagh School eventually after many years and then I was lucky enough to

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.560
be appointed head in Brintay.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.560
Oh yes.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.560
So I was there for about, oh I don't know how many years now, 17 I think.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.040
That's a long time.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.040
Yes, it's a long time, isn't it?

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.040
Yes.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.040
But at least it was a permanent position.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:50.040
Yes, which previously they were a bit ad hoc, weren't they?

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.040
Yes, that's right.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.040
I remember you teaching in Gwynfren School.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.040
Yes, that's right.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.040
I was there for quite a while.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.040
I was there for a number of years and I went away and I came back, I think.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.040
Ah, right.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.520
I was there on two separate occasions, I know, yes.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.520
Yes, so that would account for everybody's...

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.520
Don't ask me for dates now because I've got one.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:20.520
No, I remember you being in Gwynfren School when my family moved in the village and my

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.520
sister was in your class.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.520
That's right.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.520
And she remembers you very well.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.520
That's good.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So, yes, so you were saying that your father worked in Minner, Lyme, Porran.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Yes, his father had worked there before him.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Yes, that's what I was going to inquire.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Edward Rogers was my grandfather and he'd married in 1870, I think that's the date.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:03.480
He came to Gwynfren but of course it was known in those days as...

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.480
Oh dear, isn't it awful?

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.480
Yes, it was certainly not Gwynfren.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.480
Anyway, they hadn't labelled it as Gwynfren then.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.480
It was Minnera...

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.480
Oh, it would be Pentribice.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:26.480
Pentribice was known locally but officially it was Minnera Mountain, I think.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.960
Yes, Minnera Mountain or something like that.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:34.960
So at that time, did your grandfather, do you know if he...

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.960
Well, he would work via St Edward's side of the quarry, yes?

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:45.960
No, he lived in the Minnera village, must have been going for...

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.960
because he was in one of the cottages on the village.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.960
In the village?

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.960
Yes, so he was...

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.440
He'd always lived in the village itself.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.440
So he would walk to work and it would be Minnera Lime Company.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.440
Yes, he worked at Minnera Lime Company, that's right.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:08.440
I don't know what his job was or anything but...

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:18.440
My father followed him when he was ready to leave school and he worked there as well.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.440
Yes.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.440
Yes.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.920
So it was a bit...

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.920
Yes, hard work but there was nothing else.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.920
Well, there would only have been mining which wasn't...

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.920
there weren't an awful lot around Gwynryn, you see.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.920
They were further out.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:41.920
And that was no picnic, just going down the mine there.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.920
No.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:48.920
It was dangerous as well as anything else.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:54.400
And there were some lead quarries there as well.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.400
All sorts of quarries I think up on the mountain.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:03.400
But the biggest one that came I think was the Lime quarry when that opened.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.400
You've got dates.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.400
Yes.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.400
Yes.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:14.400
All I know is that we used to go down the path that you were talking about

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.880
with some tea, cold tea for my dad when it was very hot, you know, when the weather was very hot.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.880
Yes.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:22.880
Yes.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.880
That's the only thing I remember.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.880
For the break times.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.880
Yes, that's right.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.880
Yes.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.880
Yes.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:36.880
And I can just remember the alarms that were set off.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:37.880
Oh yes.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:47.360
When they were ready to bring down the rocks.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.360
Yes.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.360
But for a long time they worked all by hand.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:58.360
And in much later years they had lorries and equipment that I suppose to move it.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.360
Yes.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.360
Yes.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.360
Oh, so you remember the railway train coming into the...

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:14.840
I remember the railway train coming as it came along the lower end of the Limeworks village,

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.840
do you know what I mean?

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.840
Yes.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.840
The village itself.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.840
Yes, alongside Nice Funlin Road.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.840
Nice Funlin, that's it.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.840
Yes.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.840
Now in the earth.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:29.840
And we used to go to an ant mine down there in that little village.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.320
And we were able to see the train coming along.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.320
Yes.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.320
And going back again.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.320
Yes.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.320
Yes.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.320
So that was quite interesting for children I suppose.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:47.320
But we were all never to go beyond the gates.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.320
Definitely.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.320
Yes.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.320
Yes.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.320
Yes.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:56.320
So, where are we now?

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.320
We're doing very nicely, Phyllis.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:06.800
So, would you like to show me a couple of your photographs?

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.800
Right.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:13.800
And this one is of the cottage, isn't it, where we lived?

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.800
Oh yes.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.800
It was only a one room cottage and this was next door.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:24.800
There's another one, there's another photograph which may in some ways be better.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.800
But of course if I can find it, it's another thing.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.280
Yes, here it is.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.280
Oh no, that's the letter.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.280
That's the letter.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.280
Oh, about my grandmother's appointment.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.280
Yes.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.280
I tried to...

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.280
Yes, to mark things out for me.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.280
Yes, to mark things off, you see.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.280
Oh, that's good.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:46.280
Yes, that's the one that's 12... how many pounds?

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.280
12 pounds a year.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.280
I think that's great.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.280
Mind you, she was glad to have it because she was a widow and she used to take her two

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:03.760
little ones, six and four year old, with her to school in the morning to clean everywhere

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:09.760
and set the fires off because they had fires then.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.760
When I was there they just had stoves, you know.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.760
Yes, yes, the enclosed stoves.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.760
But in her day they were open fires.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:27.240
So she had to go and take these two little toks with her and clean and set the fires

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.240
off.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.240
Yes.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.240
Ready for nine o'clock I suppose, isn't it?

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.240
Yes.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.240
Yes.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.240
Oh my goodness.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.240
There is another one... oh this is it, I can see it hiding there.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:43.240
That's the other... those are the other two pictures of the same place.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.240
Yes.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.240
Of the...

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.240
Yes, so you get the better idea of it being a long house.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.720
I don't know which one you want or whether you want both, I don't know, but you can see

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.720
it's the same...

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.720
The same same place.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.720
It is the same cottage.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.720
Yes.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.720
Yes.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.720
No electricity at all.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.720
No.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.720
No.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:02.720
No.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.720
No water.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.720
No.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.720
It's hard to think.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:10.720
Somebody told me electricity came to the village in 1938.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.720
Yes, probably.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.200
Yes, we'd moved by then, I think we were in the village.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.200
Yes.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.200
But...

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:27.200
And the sewage system came in 1970 something.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.200
Yes, I can imagine that.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.200
But water was laid on.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.200
Yes.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.200
Yes.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.200
Yes.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.200
But anyway, that's it.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.200
Those are the... those two are the same as that one, you see.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:43.200
So you can choose which ones you want, if you want either of them or any of them.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.680
Yes, oh we could.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.680
Yeah.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.680
Now, have I got some more in here now?

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:55.680
Oh, that was my grandmother.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:56.680
That's your grandmother.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:01.680
The lady who... this letter was sent to my mother's mother, you see.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.680
The others was the Rogerses, yeah.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.680
And I don't think I've got any more in there.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.680
Yeah.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.160
Yes, these look like...

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.160
These are rather...

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.160
Family albums.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.160
Family albums, well of course they've been put in, you know.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.160
Yes.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.160
That was at Squidward School of...

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.160
Oh yes.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.160
1935.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.160
Yes.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.160
Yes.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.160
I'm on that, I'm there I think.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.160
Yes.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.160
Yes.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.160
And then my brother's there.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.160
Yes.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.160
Yes.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.160
Yeah.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.160
So that's what I've got there.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.160
Right.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:43.640
I don't know what there's anymore really, but I'll see what I've got here.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.640
Yes.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.640
Yes.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.640
No, I think...

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.640
You've got... it's all very well...

00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:03.640
Well, everything has been put in, but it's not, you know, necessarily in the right order

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.640
now.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.640
No, exactly what I want.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.120
That's it.

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.120
That's fine.

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.120
That's it.

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:15.120
Anyway, that's just an outing we had to Southport I think.

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.120
Oh yes.

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.120
That was, yeah.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.120
Yes.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.120
That was a, what are you, chapel of course we walked every day.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.120
Yes.

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.120
My father insisted we went.

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:32.120
We walked from the Steadford, which was quite a walk in itself really, to the chapel.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.120
Yes.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.120
And we went...

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:41.600
We attended the service in the morning and in the afternoon.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:48.600
Sometimes it was Sunday school and sometimes it would be, you know, at different times.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.600
Yes.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.600
Yes.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:59.600
But I'm afraid I didn't shine in any way with singing or anything like that.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.600
I left that to other members of the family I think.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.600
Yes.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.600
Oh yes.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.080
It's always best to let other people do their best.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.080
Well.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.080
Yes.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.080
Yes.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.080
If they feel comfortable that's it isn't it?

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.080
Yes.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.080
So I think that's all I've got.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.080
Yes.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.080
Well we've done very nicely, Phyllis.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.080
I don't know whether I've told you enough.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.080
Oh I think so.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:27.080
I think you've done very, you've told us a great deal.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.080
And so thank you very much.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.080
Oh, you're very welcome.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.080
Yes.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.080
Thank you.
