00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.580
My name is Vicki MacDonald and I'm at Holy Trinity Church, Llandernow, for the longest

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:13.780
yarn and I'm going to speak to Graham and he's going to tell me about his father's

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.600
exploits during the Second World War. It was Cedric John Charles Hickman. I'll never forget

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.880
he signed himself. CJC Hickman sounded very posh. In fact, he was completely down to earth.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.880
He came from what's known as the Black Country, which is in central UK, West Midlands. He

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:42.920
was an amazing sportsman and never wanted to take second place. So it seemed natural

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.280
to him. I think he was only just 18 when war broke out or was coming. He signed up for

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:59.080
the RAF and was immediately sent away from the UK to America where there was a huge training

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:07.040
program in action to try and get the RAF ready for the onslaught, which they thought and

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:14.080
did in fact happen. So luckily, he missed the very start, which was of course the Battle

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.380
of Britain. Otherwise, I suspect he would have been like many people and have been killed

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:28.620
before he really got any flying time in. So he arrived back in 1941 and was immediately

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:36.580
put on hurricanes and thoroughly enjoyed, he told me, strafing at anything that moved

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.180
over the other side of the Channel with scant regard for his own safety. And when asked

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:50.380
by the commander what posting he would like, he said, I'd like a faster airplane. Well,

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:58.180
the Spitfire was quite fast, but the plane that was faster was the wooden Mosquito. And

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:05.000
he got his way. Not many people got to pilot them. They were quite cantankerous, fast they

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.560
certainly were. And he would tell me stories. His eyes would light up and he would live

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:22.600
those moments and he thoroughly enjoyed it. He had a spell of intruder missions. He led

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:30.000
Lancasters and Pathfinders at night, bombing the targets with flares so the Lancasters

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.400
could accurately bomb and destroy the targets. Sometimes civilians, sometimes not. That's

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:44.560
war. But then a spell of night fighting, which he said was really just a matter of luck,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.880
despite what people will tell you. You were lucky. You'd had a snapshot at a Heinkel or

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.840
a Junkers 88. You got away with it or you didn't. He was lucky. He did. He shot down

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.820
some

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:09.680
vagy and for his exploits was awarded a spell as a flying instructor. This he tells me was the

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.480
most dangerous time of his life. He was nearly killed three times. He made a model out of one

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:25.280
of the crashed the crashed OXFORDs, which was the two engine plane which he taught people to fly

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.560
have still got to this day, a quite proud place on my mantle piece, fond memories. However,

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:41.760
before much further went on, he did a tiny piece with DJ Landings with 49 Squadron, I

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.760
think. And then immediately, as it looked like it was all going to be okay for the invasion,

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.760
was shipped over to Burma and to India, of all places. A sort of second front, which

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:02.280
was happening over there, taking the faithful mosquitoes, which they actually flew all the

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.720
way with several hops. And he said that was incredibly arduous, especially for the navigator,

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.400
no GPS in those days. So when they got there and had rested off, they went on missions,

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:22.400
navigation missions, strafing, bombing, supply. The most versatile airplane of all really

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:30.760
was the Mosquito. But trouble was to strike in a most peculiar fashion. Several of his

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:37.360
Squadron, by that time he was a Squadron leader, failed to return after missions. They couldn't

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:44.920
pin it down until one day when he got out after a mission. And I believe this is true,

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:51.880
I have no reason to doubt it. He slung his kit bag over the back tailplane, which promptly then

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:59.880
dropped off. And when he looked, he could see it had been eaten away by termites. The Squadron was

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:07.280
immediately grounded. And lo and behold, the Achilles heel of such a great airplane was found

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.680
to be the termite, the tiny creature. And when they looked more and more closely, they found that

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:22.360
the main spars inside aircraft had been indeed eaten away. So luck was on his side. That was a

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:31.080
close run thing. So he returned a hero back to his job, which he regretted. He really wanted to

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:39.160
stay on the RAF. They did actually ask him to go to RAF Valley for a short while, which is where

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.520
he fell in love with North Wales. And latterly, he purchased a caravan for the young children,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:52.480
myself and my sister. And we were dragged, I say dragged, I certainly loved it. Over to Valley,

00:05:52.480 --> 00:06:01.120
we met the Squadron commander and we had wonderful picnics in the sand dunes where I would enviously

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:08.160
look at the fighters screeching overhead and dad would just mutter, they're just bits of tin with

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:16.800
fire up their bottoms. He was always a bit of a petrolhead really. So that was really a brand

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:24.080
finale for a wonderful career. Thank you so much. And did you take, have you taken up flying? Did you?

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:32.720
I joined the ATC and when I was at grammar school, I went to his grammar school. Bad move. He'd won

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:40.640
everything and did everything. But I remember one day in the sports room on the big wall was

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:48.640
the name of everybody in the different houses and the fastest runners. And without really, I shouldn't

00:06:48.640 --> 00:07:00.640
say this modesty, but I looked and saw 100, 220, 440, 880 yards, one name, Hickman. And it was me.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:13.440
So I never made head boy, I say I joined the ATC, but I was to join the Royal Navy and became a Marine

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:20.160
and I'll just skip over the, it was great fun. I never thought I'd ever, it was only short service,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:28.240
I never thought I'd ever sort of do that kind of thing again. But 1983, I got a letter through the

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:38.080
post saying I was required for duty. So I was off to the Falklands. So I was involved with that and

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:45.760
we were in before anyone else and we took the SAS into, what's the word I can suppose, suppress

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:53.280
the forces which we were told by the American Secret Service were the

00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:01.600
youngsters that were being trained up in guerrilla warfare. And we found out to our cost,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:08.320
it was actually the crack regiment of all the Argentinians with the general, which was the

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:15.040
prize possession because we actually nabbed him, very expensive, lost a lot of friends,

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:20.480
but we did our job and back home. And that was the end for me, I'm glad to say. I was a bit

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:30.160
shut up, but no huge problems for the rest of my life other than I went back to engineering

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:38.480
and then ended up being a mountain guide, wandering the mountains, dragging people up things they

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:49.600
shouldn't and wouldn't go up and then returned to where Dad bought the first caravan,

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:55.600
which was Conway. So I now walk my cully and watch the planes fly over from valley.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:02.000
You do, don't they? Quite low. Very moving. Yes, it is. Oh, thank you so much. Thank you.
