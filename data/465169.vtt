00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I was in London at the time and I couldn't believe it really. I had no idea.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I didn't know where Abervane was, but I remember sitting reading it on the paper and then seeing the dreadful, dreadful things.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
That actually was another big thing, wasn't it? But I remember Abervane very, very clearly. I had no idea how bad it was.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And then when I came up here, talking to Welsh people, I came from a place like Caerphilly and so on, just down the road.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
They told us what it was like and how dangerous it was with all the things overhanging the valley.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And they used to say, oh, we knew it was going to happen. We knew it was going to happen.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But that was something like, again, you live in London, you don't know much about Wales.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It's not patronising, you just don't. You just don't.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Do you remember anything you particularly saw in the coverage on television?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Well, I remember that. Some of the families were interviewed.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I can't remember the details, but I can remember these totally distraught people who just couldn't believe it.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The parents of the kids and so on who died in the school.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And they spoke in this much stronger accent, which we aren't familiar with.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And the shots of the slurry and so on.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
There was a guy called Harry Webb, I seem to remember, who spoke very powerfully about it.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
More than powerfully, he was very, very angry.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
He wanted to, I think he wanted to charge the National Cold War with murder, I think.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I'm not quite sure about that, but it was very, very emotional.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I remember the emotion came over off the television very strongly.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So actually that was probably as strong as the moon landing.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Do you remember that?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I do.
