WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I start the bird survey again at the end of March.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I monitor the dippers and greewag deals from Pycon, they call it.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Right.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I follow the river all the way up the Cran Can Reservoir, the topside of Ebbw Vale.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
That's the source of the river Ebbw.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Along that piece of river and the adjoining river which is the Ebbw Valle,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I've got over 40 nests of dipper and around about 20 odd nests I record every year of grey wagdale.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And two of those sites are beyond the navigation.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Both ends of the long tunnel.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So the north end and the south end both have dipper nests.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And the south end has definitely got a red-legged grey wagdale nest in it.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And the top end, the north end occasionally a grey wagdale nest.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
When I first started doing it, which is now 11 years ago,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I could just walk around the end of the fence with my ladle on my shoulder.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And of course it's become more secure than that since.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So I now get the code off Vira and I go there probably four times a year,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
depending on the timing of the nesting.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Possibly a fifth sometimes if I missed the timing things.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It's all part of a monitoring scheme with the British Trust of Ornithology.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The 40 odd dipper nest that I record is just a drop in the ocean for the British Trust of Ornithology.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
But when they pull all these drops in the ocean together,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
they get a good idea of what's going on in the ornithological world.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And it's good fun, I enjoy doing it. That's the main thing.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Do you do it on your own? Do you have to be very quiet?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Mainly on my own. I sometimes take a trainee bird-bringer along with me.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Somebody who's interested in photography maybe comes along, but most of the time I do it on my own.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
What about the time of day? I presume that's important.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I try to do it between dawn and midday. It's the quieter part of the day.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
You spend a devil lot of time chatting with people otherwise, and I love chatting with people,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
but it doesn't get the job done.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
You know, I'll stand on the back door and I'll chat for about 20 minutes and I think,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
God, I think I've done another dipper's nest by now, you know.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So I try to do it early morning and by midday, well, I've had enough quite much.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I've sent years of age and the wall out by midday, so I go and have lunch and bobby feed up.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So if you go and say that you're looking at the bottom of the tunnel and you see a nest,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
how can you tell if it's active, if there's eggs in it?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Well, generally, you know, I can look at the nest, we'll put in the ladder again,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
it's kind of a small ladder wouldn't you, whether, we'll put in the ladder against the wall

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and you can see it's fresh, it's been rebuilt.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And as you're clamouring around your ladder, the dipper usually flies out anyway.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
You know, so, but mostly you've got to actually go up to the nest and put your hand in

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and feel it and see what's in there, count the eggs, count the young as they're having.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Timing you can usually do pretty well because you'll know the timing of the breeding.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
When the young are about a cent-eight days old, it's ideal time to put rings on them,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
which will identify them as individuals for the rest of their life then.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And the adults will have colour rings on them.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So I say, oh yes, it's red over blue, that's the female from Crumlin South or whatever,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
without having to catch them again.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I actually put three, there's either a red or a yellow on the left leg

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and that indicates male or female.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So if it's yellow it's a female, if it's red it's a male.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
On the other leg there's two colour rings and those two colour rings identifies it at that centre,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
a female from Crumlin South or a male from a young school or whatever.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So they're identified forevermore as individuals.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
For the first time this year I had a male who was eight years old.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
It equals a record lifespan for the tipper.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
So he's not going to be able to do the next screen I wouldn't think.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I'd be really pleased to think he is, but I don't think he's going to.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
He's such an old blinder, nested under an old arch bridge there,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
a real ancient old brick arch bridge there.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
He's not nested there for eight years, he's been in four different places along the river,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
at four different ways over the eight years.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Well what happens is one dies off and then the other one has to move to find a mate

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
or stay put and sing and attract a mate.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
But you get bigamous males, very often get one male with two nest sites,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
there are all sorts of complications.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And this guy was born down at Abertaweery by the fire station there,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
he was a pulley or a baby the next day.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
He went from there to another site just up in the park there,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Abertaweery Park.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
From there he went all the way up the valley to the little site stream which is,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
yeah, come to there, yeah.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And he read young there and then he went down then to just below Blenau

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
where I recorded him last year.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
So he got up at the third pit in those eight years.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And I know all that because he's got the colourings on his neck so I can just look

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and tell you where he's from.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So how many different colours do you have?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
I'm just throwing the maths in my head.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I think it's 14 colours and then of course you can make ever so many combinations of that.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Right, well I assume you don't have to read them.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
When you run out of one combination you can switch the male ring to the other leg

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and start all over again.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So I think I can sum it up around 200 combinations I can do.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
There's some of them that are not so easy to see.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
There's obviously red, blue, green.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
There's a brown, there's a yellow.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
There's a shocking pink, a real shocking pink.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And then there's an ordinary pink.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Don't combine those if I can help it.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
There's an orange which very often gets mistaken for brown.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Black and white, yeah.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
They're easy to see colours, they're really easy ones.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
What about green?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Yeah, they do green.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Surprisingly easy to identify, you'd think it wouldn't be, wouldn't it?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Yeah, you'd think it would be.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Biggest mistakes are between orange and red.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And shocking pink after about three or four years goes not so shocking,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
it goes more pinkish.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
I don't want to complicate that.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Every baby gets a shocking pink ring on his right leg.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000
That tells me it's a young bird that hasn't been ringed as a breeding bird.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
So when he's re-caught, he gets then his twin pullers.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Soon as I can catch him after the first year.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
So I see a shocking pink pulley, as I call them.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Pulley means baby bird basically.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
You see when there's a shocking pink ring on it on the river,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and you purposely put a net up to catch it.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So how do you catch it? Is that a big net?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Long, fine, fine, fine, fine net stretched across the river.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And there's four pockets, there are four loops.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And as the bird hits the net, he forms a loop on the other side,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and he's in that pocket.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
There's strands going through the netting,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and those strands form four pockets in the net, all the way through the river.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And as the bird hits the net, he pushes the net forward and down,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
so he gets trapped in that pocket.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Sometimes you get two, yeah, because the net is very flexible,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
you know, they're very loose pockets.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And that's good, if you can catch male and female together, bang, bang, screaming, that's good.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Do they get distressed, or do they like freeze?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000
There's obviously stress involved, but the fact is, you know, that male's been there for eight years,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
so couldn't be that bad, could it?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Can you tell, is it easy to tell how old they are?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
The BVO keeps a catalogue, a computerised catalogue, of course, of all the colouring.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
So they'll know my colour combinations.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And if a bird just comes in as a searching of colourings,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
they'll be able to tell you whether it's mine or one from up north, from Wales or whatever.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000
I had one come down to somewhere south of Newbridge, and that one came from Midwilch.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000
He'd come, I don't know how many kilometres he'd come, and it was a male.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
That's the furthest travel dip I've had up until now.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:42.000
The furthest one for me went from Aberdeleby over to Ponlepleve.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
There's a large sewage works there, just below Ponlepleve,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
and a bird ring caught in a net there on the sewage works, well, on the river adjacent to the sewage works.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And that's my furthest one at the moment.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
But I had one come to me from way up in Midwilch.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
So mine would be going that far as well, just so nobody's caught me.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Can you tell until they get bigger after that first year?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
No, just change influence. They start off with a speckledy colour, like a baby robin.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
A young robin in his first few months is just speckledy colour all over.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And young dippers are like that as well, just speckledy all over.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
By the autumn, they look exactly like their parents and can't tell the difference.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
So then I'm looking for rings. I'm looking for colour rings.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Or the lack of, if there's no rings on one of the adults feeding at the nest,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
I'll put a net in my catching and put rings on them.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Because in time it will save me and the bird a lot of stress.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Well, not stress for me, it's quite fun for me going up to.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
It's all empty instinct job, isn't it?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:58.000
But it will save the bird a lot of stress of being caught and ringed and so on.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And do they really spend all, well, they can't spend all their life on the river.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Pretty well, yeah.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Because obviously they have to leave the river to go from one to three.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
But what they're doing is following little river that's sort of stream that's over the mountains.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
That's how they've done it. They've followed a little stream that's up a mountain, down a mountain, whatever.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
So what do they feed on?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Even down to the seashore and back up a river.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Right.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
That's been known as well. They've been caught down on, feeding on the Esfydl.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And of course they'll go up another river and find one there.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
It's young birds looking for territories of their own.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Most movement is done in that first year. Long distant movements.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Right.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
But these intermediate movements are because one of the pairs has died off.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000
What's happening is there's a male looking for a territory and he stumbles along the territory.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
There's a male in it but it's got a female in it, you know, and vice versa.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
If it's a male looking for a female, you'll sit on a rock in the middle of the river and sing until one comes along, basically.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
You know, that's what all this singing is about, you know, whether it be a blackbird or whatever.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
So they pretty much do mate for life then? It's only when one of them...

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Well, it's difficult to say really, but I'd rather think they do because of the longevity of the ones I know of, you know.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:28.000
You do have the bigamous ones. I've had a male servicing three nets.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
To have two is not an unusual talk.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
That's not unusual.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Not unusual at all.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:44.000
But along the river you'll have a male down here that's got another female, three nest territories further up.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
So he's crossing two other territories to get to his other female, you know.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Wow, those four years.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
But he wouldn't think that would happen, but it does, it does, yeah.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And what would it actually feed on and what do they feed the babies on?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
They feed them almost entirely on insect larvae out of the water.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Caddis fly, mayfly and so on.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Of course, their breeding is timed to when those things are walking up the walls, coming out of the water, actually out of their little cocoons.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And the dippers are very, very young in that period.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Well, there you go, that's what they start nesting.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
They're nesting nests building now.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
You know, they're all in territory repairing and building nests now.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Already?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
They will repair the same old nest year.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Like I've got a dipper nest sabacan like this.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
But all there in a very deep cut in is the river.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Big tunnel that goes under the one on the flats, the tunnel.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000
I was told about that nest by an old chap who took eggs from there when he was a boy.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Now, if you work it out, that nest had been nesting like 50 odd years.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And it's still there now, it's still using it.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Of course, it's a combination of the one with the pair dying off, another one coming in, the other one dies off, another one comes in.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I took the guy there and I said, where's the nest then?

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
He said, it's just below that pipe he said in the mottage, he said on the wall.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
I said, that's right, it's still there now.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
It's that same spot where he took eggs out when he was a boy.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And it worked out like 56 years ago or something.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
It's incredible, isn't it?

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
That is incredible, yeah.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:25.000
The beauty of those old industrial sites, there's walls and tunnels and bridges and it's still there, the old stonework.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
And when they built these arches, I'm the builder, sorry, I know what I'm talking about.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
When you build an arch, you build a former, a wooden former, yeah?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And this rests on pieces of steel or wood in the wall, mostly wood, because you could just cut it off and leave it there afterwards.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:53.000
So along the bottom where the arch meets the upright, along here there's a series of holes where the wood was long long,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:00.000
because it had rotted out 20 years ago, and left these nice 16 holes and that's where you find a lot of them in there.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:11.000
You know, some of them, I got one at the old site there at Abbott-le-Eddy and at Deverdell, I'll find this one, they changed their site.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And then they started using a Dipper diadote. They put two foot above the water, it's all in the arch.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
What shape is the Dipper's Nest?

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Well, a Dipper's Nest is quite bulky, it's football size. So in the old, it's only like this big, but then they bring a big canopy out over the top and a big bowl underneath,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:38.000
and you've got to put your hand up in like that to get in there, you know, just up and in. You can't look in the nest.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000
There's this big canopy over the top and that keeps the end of the trip in water, there's a lot of water in these situations, you know,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.000
and so a lot of water's tripping over and it hides the nest from predators and that. It's quite the construction.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:58.000
It takes some months to make it, it's not something that a blackbird builds in a week or something. These dippers take months to build these nests.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:06.000
The biggest predators I have found has been crows and macaws in this, because they get way the younger, the younger they go looking.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:14.000
But if it's further up the tunnel, of course they're afraid to go in places like that. So the situation is in the protection mainly.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:23.000
If it's low on the water, they're vulnerable to an otter or something, a mink. Not too many these days, but there's mink along the river, and there's otters along the river.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Do you see evidence of that along the site?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:34.000
All the time, yeah, all the time. So, but the biggest predators would be avian predators. Your macaw or a crow would hear the young calling for food.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
They're feeding their own food.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And they can get in at the entrance.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
They just came to the wall and put their head in.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Don't get a devil lot of predation. Predation every year would be down as much as 10% probably, you know, the nests, which is not a lot.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Whereas an open nest for black birds and song fish and everything like that, they must lose every other one, everything.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:12.000
But they've all got a part to play, you know. You know, magbys stealing the eggs and the younger birds. But it's all part of the natural cycle of events, you know.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Magbys do a good job, otherwise, you know, cleaning up dead things and things like that.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:25.000
And another thing that is peculiar to the dipper, I don't know any other bird that does it, they build their nest directly over the water.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:33.000
They don't carry the fecal sack away. The youngsters just do it straight out to the nest.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:43.000
But it goes straight into the water. And that's another deterrent for predators. If they don't find the drop-ins, they don't find the nest.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:51.000
They never ever find the dipper's nest that is not directly over the water, unless the water has receded tremendously.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:17:05.000
And then, as I sat and took photographs at the nest and I couldn't believe what I was watching, the female, there was pebbles there because the river receded so much, the nest now was no longer over the water.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:14.000
So you'd go in, feed the young, drop down to the pebbles, clean up the drop-ins off the pebbles, and go down to the river and wash your billy in the river.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:22.000
And every time they'd come to feed, that's what they would do. They would feed the young, drop down to the pebbles, clean up the mess, go to the river, wash their billy in the river.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
When they first had seen that, they couldn't believe it was happening, but they probably do it all the time.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
I photographed the bird coming and going, but you can't sort of prove it.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:39.000
You said all that so quickly, and they don't go to the exact place in the river every time, so you can't focus your camera on one spot.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
They still have a photograph of that.
