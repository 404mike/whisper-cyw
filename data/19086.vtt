00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320
Mildoranda was a hotbed of singing, you know, really good class singers

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.720
come from this locality and choirs because the old Mildoranda choir was about 250 strong.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.880
Now they can't keep a choir going, a mixed choir. The only choirs that are in the valley now

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.520
really are the male voice choirs. There used to be a very very good ladies choir here,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.240
the Mildoranda ladies choir, the wife was in that, and the mixed choir which we were both in.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:39.520
But anyhow, no, it changed that way a lot, you know, social life that way. I think people are

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.800
more inclined now if they want to hear some singing, they go down to the nearest hall,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.000
like see, and pay five or six quid for it. But, oh, there you are, that's modern times, isn't it?
