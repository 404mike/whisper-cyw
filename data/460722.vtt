00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560
There's another abiding memory of television, if I can go back.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.720
I'm now about 16 years old. I don't remember it.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm just beginning to grow up a little bit.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.080
A few friends of mine used to do some

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.440
illicit, underage drinking

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.000
in terms of like half of

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.240
a pint of beer.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.280
And there was a little working man's club.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.800
There's an off-shoot valley off Trioke called Cumpark,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.800
which is a dead-end valley.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.680
And we used to go to a little,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.480
tiny little club

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.900
about six o'clock at night,

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.400
on a Thursday I think it was.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.480
And there's a television there.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.800
And what was on the television?

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.160
The early days of Coronation Street.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.400
And we used to go up there

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.840
and we'd drink our half a shandy

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.000
and watch Coronation Street.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.240
And it's now 50 years now, isn't it?

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.240
And I was thinking about this week, 50 years, and I was saying,

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.800
they showed the first episode this week

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.160
of Coronation Street.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.960
Now I don't remember that one,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.880
but that's how I remember it.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.360
And all these memories can flood in back.
