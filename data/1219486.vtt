WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We're running.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Okay.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Okay.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So, what's the date?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
What's the date?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's the 10th of February.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Okay. So it's Saturday the 10th of February

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and it's Liz Randall here with Ben Meakin.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And we're doing our Wonder Brass interview.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We are.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So, we're going to start off because you're not actually

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
officially a member of Wonder Brass.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I am not.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That's just a smack in the face though because you're a well established

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Wonder Widow.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So, can you tell me what it's like being Wonder Widow?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
At times it can be lonely.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's fun.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It can be frustrating.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
As I'm sure any

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
partner or loved one

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
of a Wonder Brassie

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
will tell you.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
yeah, it's interesting. You get to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
go to some good places

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and watch a great band

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
at the same time.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So, perhaps the first question

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I should have asked was when did you first hear about

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Wonder Brass?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
When did I first hear about Wonder Brass? So I think we've got to

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
rewind to

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
2010.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It would have been at Green Man 2010.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
At the time

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
my good friend

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Nicola Edwards

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
had been working

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
with Swickr

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
South Wales Intercultural Arts.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And they were

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
at the festival

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
to do, I believe, a carnival

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
parade as part

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
of the festival.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Wonder Brass were there

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
as a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
band to play

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
within the carnival, within the parade.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So my first

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
ever

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
introduction to Wonder Brass, or

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
knowing who Wonder Brass were,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
was at Green Man.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
At that point in

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
time I had no affiliation to the band

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
whatsoever.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I didn't even see the band anyway

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
because I missed the parade, to be honest.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I was actually meant to be in the parade.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
But festivals being festivals.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Alas, I wasn't

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
there. So I hadn't actually seen the band

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
at that point, but was aware who

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
the band were.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Incidentally

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
my...

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
who I

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
believed to be Wonder Brass weren't Wonder

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Brass because I don't know whether

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
you know, you're aware, or

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I'm sure not a Wonder Brass aren't aware, but

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
there is another band, a more famous

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
band called Wonder Brass

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
who are

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Bjork's backing band, or brass band.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Ah, I didn't know, I knew there was others.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Right, so my

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
understanding of

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Wonder Brass, or

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
knowledge of Wonder Brass was Bjork's

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Wonder Brass, and not the Wonder

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Brass we know and love.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So yeah, my first introduction to Wonder Brass

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
was at Green Man.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
At that point in time

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
the only person I really knew

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
from Wonder Brass was

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Brett, Brett Chandre

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
who, ex-member of

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Wonder Brass,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
who was playing flute

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
or flautist.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So you've

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
you had heard of Wonder Brass

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and you obviously, so you said you were

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
meant to be in the parade, so you were part of Swicker?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I wasn't part of Swicker at that point.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I was

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
friends with Nicola

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Nicola Edwards who

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
had

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
been doing some work

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
experience I believe

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
with Swicker as part of her Masters.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So I got

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
introduction in, well

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
being introduced to Swicker and what

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
they did at the festival

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and just happened to be there and Nicola was like

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
well you should come and

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
you know, see these guys and

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
see what they do

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
with the puppetry and

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
carnival arts

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
stuff like that.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And Wonder Brass just, as I say,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
just happened to be there

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
as the parade band so to speak.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
So are you kind of musical in your background

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
because I know you're DJ now, have you always

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
been a bit?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I've always had a love of music

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
my, yeah I guess

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that's my passion

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
really is watching bands.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I don't play any instruments

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I do collect music

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I'm a big vinyl collector

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and that's got me into

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
what I do, well my hobby is

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
DJing basically

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and through that love, yeah

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I guess, you know, attending festivals and

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
watching bands so music's

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
always been there, always been a part of my life.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I might come back to that because I'm interested

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
about what shaped your musical kind of

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
you know, vent as it were.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
But going back to meeting

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Wonder Brass then, was there anyone in particular that stood out

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
putting the band that you kind of

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
you struck a chord with?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
History being history

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
for the listeners, my partner

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
is Jenny Bradley who

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
I've got to be careful how I word this

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and she's told me to be careful how I word this

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
who is the baritone player

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
but is not the current baritone

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
player because that would be Hannah.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
She's the short girl

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
with the big saxophone and the short dress

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
as she likes to be known.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So yeah, fast forward

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
a few

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
months on from August 2010

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and being at Green Man.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Jenny incidentally

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
also plays in

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Tap Syrup who

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Brett as I mentioned

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
earlier, he was playing flute

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
at the time with Wonder Brass.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
That was his other band basically, Tap Syrup

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
the Ska band. I've

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
been watching that band for

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
just a long long time

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
before actually Jenny joined

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
as saxophone player for them.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
So fast forward to

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
early December 2010

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and I was

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
watching them at

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Club of Bond in

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Ponty.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
A usual haunt for them because

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
they're a local Ponty band.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And this little

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
girl at the end of her gig jumped off

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
stage and shall we say

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
the rest is history.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Basically.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
So yes.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
So that's how I got into Wonder Brass.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
So to speak.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
So and obviously

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Jenny's quite an active member of the committee

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
in Wonder Brass and is very active

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
in driving the band forward.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Raging gigs. So I suppose

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
you were kind of

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
automatically wrapped up

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
in that and what was that like

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
to kind of enter into that?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
How much of your life is

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
taken up with that as well as

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
that's a good question.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I mean it's

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
I guess it's one of those

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
things that I mean having

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
a love

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
of music myself and

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
you know

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
going out and watching bands

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and just

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
enjoying

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
music and musicianship.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
It's one of those things that's gone hand in hand

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
really so it's been

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
something that I've embraced.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
To start off with

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
early into the relationship I guess it was

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
like whoa

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
this has taken up a lot of time.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Seeing someone

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
you love and you want to be with

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and their time has been taking up

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
organising this band

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
and having a nine to five

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
as well and it's like crikey.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Am I ever going to see this person?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
It's quite like whoa

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
what comes first? Is it me or is it the band?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
But

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
when it's

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
something that someone's got a passion for

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and they absolutely love and you can

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
see that and that comes through.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
It's something that I've just kind of

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
embraced and gone with

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and it's a really enjoyable

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
experience to hang out with

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
a lot of cool creative people

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and watch that process

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and the fact that the band

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
being a community band

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
the members are ever changing so you've

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
always got this kind of lovely kind of

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
family

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
feeling to it really.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
People are coming and going

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
new faces come in, people

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
leave and everybody's

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
there for everybody and

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
as I said earlier you get to go to

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
some pretty cool places

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and some great gigs.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Yeah.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I've always thought that's really kind of

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
giving a lot of yourself as well

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
to the band because it is a very supportive

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
thing. Little things like

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
even if you're not going to the gig

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
you're supporting, you might drop Jenny off

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
at the gig or you might be helping other members

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
of the band as well supporting the band.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Saying I'll pick you up

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
from there or I'll ferry kit around

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
which I know you've done before.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
I can see that's

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
a very supportive role that you've got.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
It's just a natural thing to do

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
and

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
it's an enjoyable thing

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
to do and also

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
if I can help Jenny

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
in doing that as well

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
it makes her life a little bit easier

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and it just makes it a bit more

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
of an enjoyable process so to speak.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So over

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
the years since 2010

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
how have you seen the band change?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
So you've seen a lot of members come and go.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
A lot. I mean

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
we haven't really spoken

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
about the first time I saw the band have we?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Yeah. Okay, yeah not playing.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
So the first time

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
I

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
saw Wonder Brass

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
was in Christmas 2010

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
December when they

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
did the, there used to be

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
I don't know whether it's still going on the Christmas

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
meltdown

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
which was

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
I'm not sure whether it was a charity

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
event, I'm not sure

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
but it was a collection of a

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Christmas event and it was in the globe

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
with a number of

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Cardiff bands and Wonder Brass

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
happened to be up there, I think they were headlining

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
at the time and Jenny

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
said do you want to come and

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
see? And I was like well yeah of course I want to see

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
you know

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
never having

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
seen a brass band, you know my interpretation

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
of a brass band was

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
something that you know you get forced

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
to have in school either a school brass band

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
or a kind of traditional

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
kind of collary band

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
or Salvation Army so

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
not knowing

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
what

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
a big brass band was like

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
you know having

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
watched hundreds of

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
thousands, probably thousands of bands

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
up to that point

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
I've never really been

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
introduced to a brass band so

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
quite interesting

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
The thing that stood out for me was

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Rob Smith

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
released the band at the time had broken his hip

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
so I'd never met Rob

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
so Rob did that whole gig sat down

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
because he'd broken his hip playing

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
football so that was quite

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
interesting to see this man leading a band

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
whilst sat down

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and it was a huge

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
band at that point I mean

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I'm trying to think of, well it

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
filled the

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
stage of the globe

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
so I would have thought that

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
it would have been 30 plus

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
at least maybe knocking on

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
for 40 members at that point

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
so yeah

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
So that was the first gig?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Yeah. And then I can't imagine

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
how many times you see

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
the band play, you must be well

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
versed in all of the Wender Brass

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
back catalogue

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Completely versed in the Wender Brass

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
back catalogue

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
you know

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I was trying to go through my head

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
last night as to

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
what have been the standout gigs

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
there's been so many

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
and

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
going back to the question of having

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
seen the band change as well

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
and

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
that brings to mind that

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
it's a community band, it's not a traditional

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
band format whereby

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
you've got formates from school

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
who have played guitars

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
since they were 12 or drums

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and they've kind of grown up together

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
and it's just like that

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
little family you know

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
you've got a community band here where anybody

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
can come and leave at any point

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
and also the

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
diversity in people as well, the demograph

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
of the band as well

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
so you've got lawyers, you've got

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
doctors, you've got

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
people from everyday life

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
people who were unemployed

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
people who

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
so a wide range of

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
people and a wide range of

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
I don't want to use the word

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
talent because that's

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
not the right word to use but

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
a varying degree of playability

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And I suppose musicality as well

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
in terms of what people are interested in

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
outside of the band because

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
people quite often have different musical

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
tastes outside of playing in Wander Brass

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
playing in Wander Brass for different reasons

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
and the social part and the community part

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Well absolutely, I mean

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
if I use Jenny as an example

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
she plays in Wander Brass, she's also in a

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Ska band, she's also in

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
a Balkan Gypsy band

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
she's also in

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
a jazz, I don't want to say

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
jazz trio, she'll give me a clip for that

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
when I get, as she listens back to this

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
a kind of funky kind of house trio

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
as well, so I mean

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
to see other band members

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
who do stuff outside

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
of that as well and

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
different musical tastes

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
that is interesting

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And do you think that sort of thing drives

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
the band, what do you think is

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
the main drive of the band? Because you've got

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
whole kind of people who are

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
you know, Rob as a musical director

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
and certain people who

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
drive, like committee members who

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
are more active, you know, who drive things forward

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
But as we said, there's lots of people over

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
the years who come and go

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
What kind of drives

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
at different times have you seen

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
over the years?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
I think obviously

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
the main driving factor is

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
fun and

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
I think that's

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
why people do it, it's a community band

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
people are doing it

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
for the love of doing it, nobody gets

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
paid, you know

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
people get, you know, it's

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
I guess

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
every band member will have a different

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
reason for why they're in

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Wander Brass, whether or not it's

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
to bet themselves or whether or not it's to

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
just be there to have

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
fun and hang out

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
But I think, you know, the driving factor is

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
for what

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
people want to get out of it is

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
what has

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
driven it, that was the original question

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
what drives it is

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
just the variation

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
and the different projects and

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
working with different

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
collaborating with different people as well

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and keeping that kind of

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
fun element, I mean

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
I play in a community band

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
and

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
I guess unless you're changing it up

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
all the time or doing new pieces

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
or working with different people, it can get

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
stagnated and it can

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
become a little laborious and people get a little

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
deflated, so I think

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
definitely

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
working with other people

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
and very exciting parts of Wander Brass

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
that

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
for me personally as

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
a Wander Widow and a fan

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
seeing those elements

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
come together and

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
definitely working with other people

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
So you said

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
because that was the other thing I wanted to mention about

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
how your involvement is

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
in music has kind of been

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
shaped by kind of

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
being around Wander Brass, I don't know

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
if it has or not, because you said previously

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
you're friends with Nicola and she's involved in

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Swicker, and now

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
you're a member of Barracuda

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Yes, so that became a direct

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
so

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
so

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
obviously Nicola's

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
influence from

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
working with Swicker and

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
as we said Jenny was working

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
with Swicker at the time as well, she was

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Swicker's administrator

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
so

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
when me and Jenny got together, obviously that was

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
a natural progression, I've got a background

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
in art anyway

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
I've got a graphic design degree and spent

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
four years in art college, so

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
I've got that background in

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
arts and

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Jenny was working for Swicker

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
at the time and was like

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
you should, you know, just for the record

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Swicker, South Wales Intercultural

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Arts

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
they used to program

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
and run Cut of Cuddle

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
just for the listeners

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
so they've got a little bit of background there

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
so yeah

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
so naturally

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
it was like well, you should come and get involved

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
with this

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
so I

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
that would have been

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
summer 2011

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
I went along

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
they used to do

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
three weeks leading up

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
to carnival itself

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
there would be open workshops

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
in Channel View Legend Center

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
and that was for any

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
member of the public to go along

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
and to basically build

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
the carnival, so there would normally be

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
whatever the theme is

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
for the carnival that year

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
and there would be people making puppets

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
people making costumes

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
just a huge hub of creativity

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
basically

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
and very fortunately

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
that summer

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
they had

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
two

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
professional puppet makers coming down

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
to run a giant puppet making

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
workshop

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Jenny said, will I be keen?

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
I was like yeah, absolutely

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
signed up for that, went along

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
and just got a hug basically

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
so that was my introduction

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
into kind of community arts

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
and the world

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
that is community arts

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
basically

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
leading on to that then

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
if you fast forward

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
where are we now? 2018?

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
if you fast forward

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
five years, so yeah 2016

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
I then joined

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
the, which was at the time

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
the carnival crew

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
they were the samba band

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
who were linked to Swicker basically

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
I joined then purely because

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Jenny was rehearsing on

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
a Tuesday night with Wonder Breasts

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
and I was sat in the house

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
and I was like, well, you know, I know this band

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
I've hung about with them, you know, doing carnivals

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
I know all the personnel

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
they look like

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
it looks like a fun thing to do

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
and basically went along

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
absolutely loved it

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
and now

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
two and a half, three years

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
down the line still playing with

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Barracuda

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
so it's kind of, yeah, you're involved in that

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
as opposed to then you're involved in your own community

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
yeah, and that's

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
been quite interesting because

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
having seen Jenny

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
working

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
with Wonder Breasts

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
and you know, her

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
involvement with gigs

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
and liaising with people

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
and going out and

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
you know

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
speaking to festival organizers, things like that

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
having that background knowledge

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
and being in Barracuda now

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
I can translate

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
what I've seen from Jenny working

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
into that as well

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
and again, it's exactly

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
it's a very similar community

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
it's people from all walks of life

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
who

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
just want to come along

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
people have got various reasons why

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
they want to be there, whatever or not they want to

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
fervour their

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
musical skills or just

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
have a good time

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
I was also going to ask about the kind of

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
frustrations then

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
of being involved in

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
community projects

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
because I'm thinking about the

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
long term nature of them

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
and how they work and how

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
different people need to get involved

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
and all that sort of thing

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
what are the frustrations do you think

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
when thinking about the future

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
and keeping Wonder Breasts going

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
do you get, does Jenny come home

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
and rant about the band

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
are there particular things you see in terms of

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
its future

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
what needs to continue to happen

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
among the band?

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
First of all, for

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
a community band to be going for 25 years

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
is a massive

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
massive testament

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
it's something that

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
should be recognised

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
I can only speak from me

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
knowing

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
friends who have been in bands

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
just normal bands, your

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
guitar bands, which is music that

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
I grew up on

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
if they were around

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
for 2 or 3 years maybe

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
absolutely fantastic

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
but for a community band

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
where

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
the members are made up

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
from

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
amateur players basically

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
I know you've got

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Rob and Mark who are

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
your two professionals within the bands

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
and clearly

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Rob as musical director

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
has been there

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
from the core

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
which again is a testament

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
I'm sure at any point he's probably

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
had those frustrations and

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
where am I going with this?

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
What do I want to do?

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Seeing people come and go

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
and numbers dwindle

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
it must be highly frustrating

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
I guess everybody gets frustrated

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
because there are

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
things that

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
people personally want to do

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
which sometimes can't be

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
achieved because of various factors

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
funding factors

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
time I guess is a big element as well

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
if you think that

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
everybody in the band

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
pretty much works

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
or is

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
in full time study

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Rob's got a 9 to 5

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Jenny's got a 9 to 5

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
the organising committee have got a 9 to 5

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Mark's a full time musician

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
so I guess those frustrations

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
it's the things that you can't control

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
which are frustrating for people

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
I would say the same coming from

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
the band I play in as well

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
is that

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
you can't always be

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
in two places at once

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
I think that point is really

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
salient actually

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
about 25 years

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
being in the band a fraction of that time

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
and the fact that

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
there's Rob

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Jenny

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Mark, I know Rob and Mark

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
they're being paid to be there

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
but they don't have to be there

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
this is a choice as well

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
and you've got

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
members who have been a part of the band

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Derek as well

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
key members of the band

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
who have been there for years and years

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
and they turn up every Tuesday

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
and they don't get paid for it

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
they do it for the love of it

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
which is just phenomenal

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
it's incredible to think

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
a band made up of members

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
nobody needs to be there

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
one week

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
the whole band can not turn up

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
people keep on coming back

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
and people drop out and come back to it

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
it's gone for 25 years now

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
what's to say

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
it can't go on for another 25 years

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
I think the biggest frustration

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
with any community group at the moment

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
is funding

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
funding cuts, where do you get your money from

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
specifically

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
for big projects and things like that

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
funding is drying up

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
what would help that

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
funding is drying up and sometimes you can't do anything about that

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
do you think in terms of the band progressing

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
continuing rather

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
I think it's always progressing

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
and the fact that it never stays still

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
there's always new stuff going on

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
what do you think would help that

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
that's a really random question

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
it is a random question

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
what I'm trying to get at

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
as I've said, we've got key members doing things

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
and I'm just kind of keen to know

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
is that because

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
a lot of time

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
certain people have the knowledge of being able to do things

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
but it's about

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
because it's a community band, it's about other people learning these skills as well

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
so I'm thinking about all the skills that

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
a lot of the committee members have

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
and they're trying to share those skills

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
and they're trying to get other people involved in

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
I think that's it

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
and I think it's about empowerment

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
isn't it?

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
I think that's the key word

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
people realising that things

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
just don't happen

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
I've had it in Barracuda

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
and you see it there

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
you get to go to

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
some amazing places

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
we've only been going as a

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
community

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
from Barracuda's point of view

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
from the community band I play in

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
we've only been going for two years

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
pretty much solidly

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
and the first year was absolutely fantastic

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
we got to go to some great festivals

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
and I think it's

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
people from the band

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
realising that things just

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
don't happen

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
these gigs don't just happen

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
you don't just arrive

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
at a festival

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
because

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
it's there

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
and somebody's phoned up and said

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
I just want to play at this festival

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
there's a lot of

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
work that goes on behind the scenes

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
a lot of work

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
and I think it's

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
just empowering people

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
and like you say

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
there are people with core skills

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
and that's the beauty of a community band

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
any one member of that band

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
is going to have a skill

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
that is invaluable

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
whether or not it's organising

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
whether or not it's

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
social media

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
whether or not it's

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
poster design print

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
and if you can draw on all of that

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
there's no reason why that band

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
cannot keep going basically

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
and that's the hardest part

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
is all that background stuff

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
I guess the easy part is turning up and playing

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
so how much time

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
backstage at home

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
how much time do you think

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
is devoted

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
from Jenny's point of view

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
just out of interest

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
I'm only asking because there's other members of the band that do stuff

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
as her partner

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
and you get to see the home life

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
erm

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
a lot

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
I would think it's

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
every night

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
I would say every night

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
she's pretty much

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
doing something for a band

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
if it's not

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
it's not Wonder Brass it will be for

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Tat Syrup or

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Capra Mame or whoever

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
erm

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
so it is pretty much a full time job

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
I think it's become a little bit more manageable

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
for Jenny now because

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
she's got settled 9 to 5 whereas before

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
when she was working for Swicker

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
erm I think she'll

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
honestly say this

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
you know when we first

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
got together I was like how do you

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
how do you not stop

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
you know how do you cope with this

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
because it used to be constant

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
she'd wake up in the morning and she'd have a notebook

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
open and she'd be on her laptop

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
and it would be the same when she went to bed

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
and you know if she

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
went to bed

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
so it's a lot of time

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
it's a lot of time

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
but as you say

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
there are other band members who are equally doing

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
doing it as much if you know

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
so

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
yeah

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
I wanted to also ask a bit about

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
like your favourite

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
going back to you saying about your favourite gigs

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
and that sort of thing but

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
I just quite like a story or two

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
about some sticky wonder brass moments

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
and like

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
they get quite messy sometimes because it

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
is good fun at the end of the day once all the organising

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
is done and everyone's there

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
and you're having a good gig and a couple of beers maybe

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
it's really good fun so have you got a couple of

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
like juicy stories maybe

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
err

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
there are

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
there's probably too many to

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
it's the memory banks

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
that's what they were saying last night I was trying to

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
think about

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
thinking back to all the gigs

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
I mean

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
the great times have been the er

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
the Druids and gigs

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
going to Druids and they've always

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
been fantastic weekends because

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
you put a bunch of wonder you know

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
a bunch of wonder brasses in

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
a hotel

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
or you know

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
a nice big home for a weekend

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
with a lot of booze and a lot of

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
brass and you know

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
something's going to go wrong so

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
erm in terms of

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
I don't know

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
really

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
erm

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
it's hard to

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
remember

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
there's been some messy gigs I think

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
one of the Halloween gigs in

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
er in the moon

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
it might have been about four years ago

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
that was particularly eventful

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
I remember

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
erm yeah

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
I really enjoy

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
seeing the interactions in the band

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
and I think when you've got members

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
who are er a little

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
bit erm a little bit

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
more kind of gregarious

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
perhaps is the word to use

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
er and other members of the band who

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
left to their own devices

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
probably would just be a bit more quiet

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
in the background I love seeing the mix

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
and how you know you've got some

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
members who just draw things out in other

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
people and it's really nice to see

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
you know people the dynamics in that way

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
kind of changing. Absolutely yeah

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
I think that's nice and I think

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
you know erm

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
it's like with anything really isn't it

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
somebody joins a band and they're

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
you know

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
they're on their best behaviour

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
aren't they really

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
that kind of what goes on tour stage on tour

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
kind of mentality you know you know you put them

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
in a situation and

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
outside of their comfort

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
zone and it's you know some

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
people are like oh

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
I've never done this and I've never been here

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
this is exciting

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
so we erm so yeah yeah that's

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
that's interesting

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
yeah. So like what

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
are there any other aspects

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
of Wunderbras and Wunderbras

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
past and future

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
that you think are kind of important to

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
to acknowledge and to talk about?

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Erm

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
I don't

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
that's a tricky question. I know

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
it's a broad question as well. It is a very broad question

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
erm I

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
just think to keep on doing what

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
what has

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
been done because if it's

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
if it's the good old saying

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000
if it's not broke don't fix it and

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
you know there seems to be

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
something has been done

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
right over the years. Over 25 years

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
whatever it is

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
you know

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
something has been done right

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
and I think it's just keeping

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
that level of enthusiasm

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
up for people you know

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
work at I know that you're going to be

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
working with Claude again

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
in a couple of weeks. I mean

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
that will be fantastic

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
for people

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
who knew people to the band

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
particularly who have not done a project

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
that we're talking about the

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000
25th anniversary

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
project and the recordings.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
So

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
people working with someone like that

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
you know with Claude

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Daphos just a renowned artist

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
and virtuoso

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
and brings his own unique

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
style of conducting and

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
and

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
map dynamics. So I think

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
I think things like that will just

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
keep the band

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
keep everybody in the band enthused

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
and the beauty is that you know

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
there's always going

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
to be youth and there's always going to be

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
you know people coming up through the ranks

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
who want to play brass

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
and want to join

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
a band without any commitments

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
to either further

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
develop themselves or like we say just to have

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
a good time and just be part of a really

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
nice solid community. So I

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
think that's what it's about is the community

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
element and keeping that going.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
Yeah definitely. Totally.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
And the Wonder Widows as well because I think

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
there's quite you know there's a group

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
and a cast loves hanging out with the

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
band and the others.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Yeah I mean

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
I've seen

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
many people come and go from the Wonder Widows I think

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
at some point I've just been the only

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Wonder Widow

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
so it does get lonely

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
but

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
I've just kind of jumped in and

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
embraced it really and the band

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
really it's just a fantastic environment

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
to be around. Yeah. That's what

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
I enjoy. That's why

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
I follow the band around. You know I could

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
choose just to stay in the house and

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
not really have any interest in it

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
but it's great.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
I love it. You know you guys are absolutely

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
fantastic. Like just

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
like you say seeing the little relationships

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
within the band as well that

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
that's nice

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
and it's just one

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
one nice family.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
That's the best way to see it is

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Wonderbress is a really really good family

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
and it's an ever changing family as well

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
you know people come, people go

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
you know people

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
come back as well and that's

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
super. Yeah.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Yeah. It's really nice

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
to see partners

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
and like you say that's quite a

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
commitment and I think that all

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
goes into the mix of the support

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
around keeping the band going. Yeah.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
It's having the partners there. I mean the recent

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
trip to Budapest that was lovely

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
because you know you had

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Mariel's husband and

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
John's wife.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
John's wife and

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000
My husband.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
I can't think who else went. I didn't go. No.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
Oh you didn't. No. But that was lovely.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
I mean you know

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
getting to know people who you've

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
not met yet and you shoot stories about

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
so yeah.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Yeah.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
I don't have any more

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
questions so I think we're

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
maybe at the end of our interview

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
if that's alright. Unless you want to

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
say anything else about the band. Well

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
maybe I'll ask you

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
how

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000
how do you feel Wonderbress

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000
you know in terms of

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
developing and

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
what are your

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
thoughts on it?

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
My thoughts are I don't know how

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
key members

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
of the band do it all the time as

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
we've discussed Jenny's involvement

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
other than Jenny's involvement

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
obviously as well. Rob

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
they're all very

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
very active. I know I'm on

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
the committee. Yeah. But I know

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
that they are always the most

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000
active committee members. I don't think anyone would

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000
deny that at all.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
I think it's quite incredible that they have that drive

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
to be able to keep the band going.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
And I'm interested in

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
how

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
other people can

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000
tap into that. Because that's

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
quite a lot to rely on

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000
a number of people. Yes.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000
And I think sharing the load is

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
the way forward.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
But that's easier said than done. That's quite

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
if you've been involved in a

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
certain you know environment

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
for a number of years. And it's about

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
contacts as you say and building up contacts.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
But I feel that I'm learning from them

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
and I want to continue to learn from them

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
as a band member. Because

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
it's opened my eyes to a whole different aspect

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
of Cardiff and Cardiff culture. Yeah.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
And like you say just seeing people

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
on the street have met you. And you know

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000
I wouldn't have met you had I not been for Wonder Brass.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
I've met The Swick a lot. Of course.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
I've met The Barracuda a lot. Yeah. You know there's a massive

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000
kind of community there. So it's a

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000
community isn't it? It's a community and the

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
the networking that goes along with that.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:58.000
And I think if everybody can pull each other along as you know as they go along the way.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000
And it's a journey really isn't it? And nobody else is going to do that for you.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000
So yeah. Yeah.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
And I think that is you know it's not just about music.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
It's not just about Wonder Brass. That is about

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
me as a kind of you know

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
I've lived in Cardiff for since 2002 now.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
And it's

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000
it's been as part of Wonder Brass

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
I think that I've got to know such a

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000
circle of people just basically through

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Hannah you know. Yes.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
She's a member of the band. I've known Hannah

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
for 10 years or so.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
Had it not been for her saying oh mate come on

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000
join Wonder Brass. I wouldn't have

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
potentially known this big group of people.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
And then now with my friends Beth and Rich

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
who you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
It's not necessarily about them being

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
a part of the band. They will come and support the band.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000
They will get to know other people who come

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
and watch the band. And I think

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
it is definitely about that sense of community.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
Yeah.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
And especially in

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
in these times at the moment

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
with the political climate as it is

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
I think that is vitally important.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
The whole element on

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
community

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
and

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
keeping it within

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
your locality and

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
being able to do that and give a little bit

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
of positive to

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000
people I think is

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
really important. Yeah.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
And

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000
is more

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000
that's why it is more than just like you say

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
more than just a band.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
It's more than just people playing

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000
instruments for people. It's

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
all encompassed in really.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Definitely. I think it's nice having

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000
the projects like this to actually reflect on

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
because the heritage is the key word

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
of this isn't it. Yes. Reflect on

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
where it's been and where it's going as well

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
because you know it's given me a lot of insight

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000
into the life of people

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
involved in the

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
project I suppose.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Yeah. In the band. But also

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
what Cardiff was like is

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
you know what this area of

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000
Wales has been like for the last 25 years.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
Well of course. Of course. I mean I guess

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
that's changed dramatically.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
I mean the whole demograph, the whole

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
like we said the political climate

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
and how that has changed

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
things as well you know.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
You know

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
how funding has changed things and

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000
how you know

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
having

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000
I guess what we took for granted

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
previously things that are fingertips

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
they were just there you know.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
You know there were things that were

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
totally disposable.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
You could just have them and take them and

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
there were people

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
giving handouts so to speak and like

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
go and do this, go and do this.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
And now how

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000
that has all kind of changed and

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000
people have got to be a little bit more

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
self-sufficient I guess.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
So yeah.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
Yeah. But I think Wunderbuss

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
is a good way to

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
experience that.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
And to kind of, there's a potential

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000
there for people to develop themselves as well

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000
as develop the band.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
And I think that's pretty exciting.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
But I know

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
also people are very busy in their lives

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
like you said. Everyone's got jobs and

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
so I kind of

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
marvel at the drive of

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
people.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Especially when it comes to things that

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000
like Wunderbuss and organising things.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
But it's a passion isn't it I suppose?

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
Yeah it's a passion. I mean nobody's doing it

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
for

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
I guess any reward apart from

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
making people happy.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
And that's huge.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
If your ultimate

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
drive is just making people happy and

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
for your own personal happiness then

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
that's fantastic.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
And that will continue to

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
perpetuate and

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
hopefully in 25

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000
years time

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
we'll be doing this interview again.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Yeah we never know. Well yeah, it'll be great.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Maybe older and wiser by then.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Or just have less

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
memory. Well that's true yeah.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
We'll have to listen back to this interview.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000
Remind us of something.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Cool. Brilliant. Thank you very much.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
No thank you. It's been lovely. Cheers.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Cheers.
