Roedd yn gwneud dros.

Roedd yn gwneud dros,

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.860
ond roedd yn gwneud yn ymwneud,

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.860

roedd hi'n gwneud drosau, gynlluniau drosau, roedd gennym ni hefyd i'w gwneud hefyd.

Roedd hi'n gwneud drosau o Marks & Spencer a phobl ar y sianedd.

O, roeddwn i'n gwybod, iawn.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.860
Ond roedd hi'n 6 ffordd, oes 6 ffordd,

Roedd nhw'n cael trafodaeth, roedd yn mynd i'r bus i Porthcarl,

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.860

Roedd yn cael ei gweithio.

Oherwydd roedd hi'n cael radio yn ei gweithio,

Roeddwn ni'n cael ei gweithio,

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.860
roedd nhw'n cael ei gweithio.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.860
Roeddwn ni'n cael ei gweithio i hynny.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.860
Roedd nhw'n cael ei gweithio ar y radio?

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.860
Ie, roedd nhw'n cael ei gweithio, ie.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.860
Ond os yw'r temperatur

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.860

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.860
roeddwn ni ddim yn gweithio,

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.860

Roedd ym mhob yno lle roedd angen i chi ddweud a gweithio arno fel yna.

A yna, fe wnaeth i gyd gwaith yna yn Westcanal Wharf.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.080

Ie, dwi'n dweud, gallwn i ddweud ychydig yma o ran ein bod yn ddechrau?

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.080
Ychydig.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.080
Ychydig.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.080
Ychydig.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.080
Ychydig.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.080
Gallwch chi ddisgrifio i mi beth yw'r holl dydd yma ar y dydd yma pan gwasgwch chi yma?

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.520
well, rydym wedi'i ddod o'r hyn pan oeddwch chi'n gwneud yna,

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.520
rydych chi'n ddod o'r hyn,

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.520
maen nhw'n cael y radiu.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.520
A sut ydych chi'n teimlo am gweithio yno?

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.520
Roeddwn i'n gobeithio. Roeddwn i'n gobeithio, iawn.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.520
Felly,

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.520
a allwn i ddweud, sut yw'r bobl lleol

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.520
yn gweld, yw, gweithio, gweithio'n ffactorol,

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.520
fel statws,

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.520
i gydnabod â, yw, gweithio mewn siop neu rhywbeth?

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:14.520
A oedd yn gweithio ar un pwmp?

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.520
Dwi ddim yn gwybod…

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.520
well, sut gallwn i ddweud…

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:24.520
Nid yw rhai o bobl yn gweithio mewn ffactorol, yw'r rhai?

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.520
fel fy marn i'r marn i'r ffactor,

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.520
ond dyna ddim yn fy marn.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.520
Roeddwn i'n gweithio mewn ffactor yn ystod yna,

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.520
fel y ddwylau fy marn i'n gweithio,

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.520
pan roeddwn i'n gweithio mewn ffactor,

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.520
yw'r hyn sy'n degradio.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.520
Ond dwi ddim yn credu bod yn degradio,

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.520
oherwydd roeddwn i'n gobeithio.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.520
Mae'r gweithio mewn ffactor yn…

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.520
Rydyn ni'n gwneud yn unig, dyna beth rwy'n credu.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.520
Os ydym ni'n gwybod,

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.520
byddwn ni ddim yn gallu gweithio mewn ffactor, yw'n gwybod?

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.520
Felly, yn fy marn,

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.520
mae gennym ffordd o fywyd yn unig.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.520
Mae'n fwy o bobl yn dweud,

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:01.520
o, dwi ddim yn gweithio mewn ffactor,

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.520
ond dwi'n gobeithio mewn ffactor.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.520
Dwi ddim yn gwybod gweithio mewn ffactor.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.520
Felly dyna'r ffordd rwy'n teimlo amdano.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.520
Ond mae'n gwybod, mae'n gwybod, mae gennym ni.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.520
Ond mae'n gwybod, mae'n gwybod, mae'n gwybod, mae'n gwybod.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.520
Ie, ie, mae'n gwybod, ie.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.520
A gallwch chi ddechrau, fel un ddwylau gweithio,

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.520
sut byddai'n dechrau,

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.520
byddai'n dechrau,

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.520
fel pan oeddwch chi'n ddwylau gweithio, yna?

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.520
Wel, chi'n clocio, yn ogystal â chi'n clocio

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.520
ac yna byddwch chi'n siarad yn dda o'ch ddwylau

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.520
ac byddwch chi'n dechrau,

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.520
yn ogystal â'r ddwylau,

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.520
ac yna byddwch chi'n cael bric

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.520
a gallwch chi ddechrau yn y canthin,

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.520
ond mae'n cael cyfnod,

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.520
ond mae'n cael cyfnod,

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.520
dwi'n meddwl, ymlaen, ymlaen,

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.520
ond mae'n cael cyfnod,

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.520
ond mae'n cael cyfnod,

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.520
Ond yna, byddwch chi'n cyrraedd,

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.520
yna, yna, lunchtown, yna,

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.520
byddwn yn mynd yn y canthin,

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.520
ond weithiau,

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.520
byddwn yn mynd i'r gwyb,

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.520
oherwydd roedd hi'n fwy cyngorol yna,

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.520
felly, i gael ychwanegol ffwrdd,

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.520
byddwn yn mynd i'r gwyb yma,

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.520
amdano'n mynd yn ôl i'r ffatri,

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.520
yw hynny'n dda i'n ei ddweud?

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.520
Ond yna byddwch chi'n cael unrhyw ffrwyth yn y ddwylau

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.520
ac yna byddwch chi'n ymwneud yna,

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.520
I was to ride a bike to work I did,

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.520
you know,

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.520
and you go and get your bike and ride home.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.520
But that's all it was really.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.520
How long did it take you to get there?

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.520
Oh, about 10 minutes,

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.520
because it's only up the road to me, you know.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.520
Sometimes I used to come home dinner times,

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.520
in the summer,

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.520
when the weather was nice,

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.520
I'd ride home

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.520
and my mother would have my dinner ready

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.520
and I'd be right back then, you know,

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.520
but then when I got more friends,

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.520
with the girls,

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.520
I didn't bother,

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.520
we used to stay in and have a chat

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.520
and go and have a walk around, you know.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.520
But as they say,

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.520
and then they'd have sales then,

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.520
you could buy the dresses,

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:47.520
do you know what I mean?

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.520
And they were reasonable.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.520
I mean the dresses in them days,

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.520
you'd have a circular skirt

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.520
and if you think the material

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.520
would cover the whole of this floor,

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.520
that's how big they were.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.520
They were lovely,

00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.520
lots and lots of material,

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.520
lovely dresses,

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.520
and dressing gown,

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.520
but the dresses were always lovely.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.520
Well made they were.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.520
And did you get,

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.520
you got a discount, did you?

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.520
Well, no, what it was,

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.520
they would have a sale

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.520
and then you could buy them cheaper then,

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.520
you know what I mean?

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.520
So...

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.520
Sorry, could you, could you...

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.520
Okay, so, sorry, Rita, about that.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.520
That's okay.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.520
Let's go back to the same.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.520
How many times a year then?

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.520
I would say about twice a year,

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.520
but you could buy,

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.520
they'd bring other things

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.520
into the factory as well then,

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.520
you know what I mean,

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.520
I mean that their sheets,

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.520
pillar slips,

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.520
and you always had a good sale,

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.520
it was worth buying,

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.520
they were lovely clothes,

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.520
really nice clothes,

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.520
and their sheets,

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.520
I mean, everybody that got married,

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.520
they gave them hardex sheets

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.520
for the wedding present,

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.520
and they lasted years,

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.520
they were lovely.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.520
Yeah, so, you know,

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.520
was the factory,

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.520
was it a kind of nice place to,

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.520
what I mean is,

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.520
sounds as if you had a lovely time then,

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.520
you liked the work.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.520
Building-wise and facility-wise,

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.520
was it a nice environment

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.520
to work in?

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.520
Yes, yes,

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.520
because we had a lovely canteen,

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.520
I mean, I think it might have been,

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.520
in our days,

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.520
the modern ones,

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.520
you know what I mean,

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.520
because we had a lovely big canteen,

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.520
nice toilets,

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.520
a place to put your bike,

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.520
so, you know, I think, yes,

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.520
the factory was really good.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.520
Did you think they were good employers?

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.520
Yes, I did, yes,

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.520
they were very good, yes.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:32.520
How many of you worked there?

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.520
Have you got any idea?

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.520
Oh, I don't know,

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.520
because there was a bowl, I see.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.520
There's got to be a few hundred,

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:43.520
because there was 24 on each bench,

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.520
and that's the sewing part,

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.520
and there must have been

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:53.520
about 8, 6, 8, 10 in the bench,

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.520
10 benches,

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.520
then they had a row of people doing samples,

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.520
then they had people doing the hand sewing,

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.520
like I showed you,

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.520
then people are cut out,

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.520
then there's packers,

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.520
there was people that had done overlocking,

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.520
people that had done zips,

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.520
so I'd say a few hundred easily.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.520
And you worked that out, didn't you,

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.520
quite a lot, really.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.520
That was a lot of people to lose their jobs,

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.520
wasn't it?

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.520
Oh, yes, it was,

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.520
everybody was really upset,

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.520
because we were all friends,

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.520
you know what I mean?

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.520
So it was upsetting.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.520
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.520
Oh, sorry.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.520
Were there married women working there?

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.520
Yes, yes, there were a few married women there,

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.520
and as I say, some of us got married.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.520
As I said, Sheila and Ash married Peter,

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.520
Peter, who was the engine,

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.520
looked after the machines, you know.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.520
Yeah, and did you get married when you were there?

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.520
Yes, I did, yes, yes.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.520
What year did you get married?

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.520
1959.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.520
Right.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.520
1959 I got married, yes.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.520
Were you encouraged to go to night school

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.520
or anything when you were there?

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.520
No, we never had, nothing like,

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.520
well, I didn't anyway.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.520
Well, you didn't need to with sewing.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.520
Obviously, people in the office perhaps did,

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.520
you know, because they had different views

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.520
and different things.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.520
Yes, yes.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:32.520
And can you remember how much you were paid a week?

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.520
Or a month, or a week, was it?

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.520
I think it was £2 something.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.520
If I'd have thought of it,

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.520
I could have looked for my payslip.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:45.520
I think it was £2 something, £2...

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.520
£7.60 something like that, I'm not quite sure.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.520
It wasn't a lot.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.520
You know, when I say to my grandchildren about it,

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.520
they can't believe it.

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.520
It was about £2 something, I think it was,

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.520
which was good money to us and them.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.520
Days in, it was a job.

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:05.520
Well, I was going to ask, how did that feel in the, you know?

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.520
We were quite happy with that.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.520
It was fine, it was fine.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.520
And was it piecework or was it...?

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.520
No, no, I didn't go on piecework, no, no.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.520
Some of the girls did, the ones that done the samples,

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:21.520
they did, but ours was just a wage, like, you know what I mean?

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.520
You just did your job every day.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.520
And did you say you still got a wage slip?

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.520
I'd have somewhere, but I'd have to find it.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.520
I'm sure it was £2 down the yard.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.520
Right, OK.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.520
And did you have a pay rise when you were there at all?

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.520
I can't remember, to be honest with you.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.520
I'm not sure.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.520
I should imagine he would have had.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.520
Not much, though, I don't think, because he don't have...

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.520
I can't remember having one.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.520
Right, OK, that's great.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.520
Were you all paid the same, do you think?

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.520
Oh, yes, we were all paid the same, yes, yes.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.520
So everything felt quite...

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.520
Apart from the pieceworkers, obviously, you know?

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.520
Oh, there were some people on piecework, weren't there?

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.520
Yes, yes, they used to do the samples and that, you know?

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.520
But everybody else got paid the same.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:21.520
Even the ones with the pressing, you know,

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.520
with the iron doing the pressing of the seams.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.520
And the cutters out as well?

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.520
I would think so, yes.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.520
What did you spend your wages on?

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.520
Oh, what did I spend my wages on?

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:38.520
Well, as I said, for our dinner dance,

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.520
we went and bought these special shoes with all glitter on,

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.520
I remember saving up for that.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:47.520
And we had this first evening gown, you know,

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.520
with the big skirts and that, and we had our hair done special.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.520
But we weren't like the girls today, like it,

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.520
they want to buy everything.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.520
We didn't do that, we were pretty good.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:02.520
I saved a bit, I never went mad, you know what I mean?

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.520
Because I never...

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.520
I only went to a youth club,

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.520
which that's where I met my husband when I was 15.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:14.520
But that's all I went because I met him and I didn't go far.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.520
If he was on leave, we'd go to the cinema, you know,

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.520
we'd go into town for the cinema.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:24.520
And as I say, we'd go to the fireworks display with the Horixes.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.520
Obviously, you'd be buying things then,

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.520
you'd go on the shows and whatever, but that's all.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.520
We never spent like they do today, you know what I mean?

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.520
Do you remember how much the cinema was in those days?

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:41.520
I'm not sure, it was two and six, it was one and six and two and six, I think.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.520
That seems to ring a bell, and they're shilling.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.520
Shilling two and six, yes.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.520
One and nine, see, I'm just thinking of the prices now.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.520
You've got me thinking now.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.520
Where did you go? Where did you go usually?

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.520
Did you go to one special cinema?

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.520
Well, when my husband was on leave, we'd always go into town,

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.520
as we call it, into Cardiff, like into town.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.520
And we'd see whatever film was on,

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.520
and we'd go and see The Empire or The Old Year,

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.520
one of those we'd go to.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.520
I mean, we had a cinema up the road here, which was the Ninian cinema,

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:22.520
which I only went when my children were,

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.520
when I had my children for my night out,

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.520
my husband had minded children, I'd go with my friend,

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.520
and we'd go and watch a film.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.520
That's all up the Nin, we used to call it then.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.520
But no, we only went into town.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:38.520
And what we used to do in M-days, we used to call it window shopping,

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.520
because they never had the shutters then, did they?

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.520
So we'd walk around looking in all the shop windows,

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.520
thinking, oh, I'd like that, oh, yes, and whatever.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.520
But we didn't spend much money in M-days.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.520
Did you go into town by bus?

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.520
Yes, we went in on the bus, yes, yes.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.520
Of course, ten o'clock, when the film had finished,

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:03.520
everybody would be standing up, because they always played the queen then,

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.520
and you'd be waiting for it to finish,

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.520
because you'd have to run and catch your bus.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:14.520
Did you share the wages with your family?

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.520
Did you pay your mum anything?

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.520
I did give my mother, mummy, I think it was five shillings,

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.520
something like that, I can't remember, but offhand,

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:24.520
it might have been about five shillings, I think.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.520
Oh, yes, you've talked about the perks.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.520
Can I just ask you about trade unions?

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.520
Were there any trade unions?

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.520
There was a union, yes, there was a union,

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:37.520
and we all had to join it, we were all joined the union anyway.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.520
Do you remember what the union was?

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.520
No, I can't remember, no.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:46.520
Because when it was, that's how I said about it being cold,

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.520
it had to be a certain temperature,

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.520
because the factory was such a big place,

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.520
because that was to do with the unions,

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.520
they said we had to be at a certain thing.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.520
I can't remember exactly what it was,

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.520
that's all I can remember about the unions.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:07.520
So there were no disputes or anything?

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.520
No, no, no.

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.520
And did you feel fairly treated?

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.520
Yes, I did, yes.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:18.520
Did you have to wear a certain uniform for work?

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.520
No, no.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.520
So you could just wear...

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.520
All the clothes, yes, whatever you wanted to, yes.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.520
And whatever you wanted?

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.520
Yes, whatever, yes.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.520
They were quite lax, you know, not lax,

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.520
but so long as you didn't go in and...

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.520
Yes, silly clothes, yes, yes.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.520
Right, right.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:40.520
And do you think, do you feel the work was dangerous in any way?

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.520
No, no.

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.520
I mean, I did so when I was first learning,

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.520
like you're saying, I had the needle right through my finger.

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.520
Do you know what I mean?

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.520
Well, you've just got to learn, haven't you,

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.520
and you just stop,

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.520
and then they pull the needle out then for you,

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.520
do you know what I mean?

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.520
But they had good first aid as well,

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.520
I mean, I've got to be fair.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.520
But one time I was running across,

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.520
which I shouldn't have done when it was a break,

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.520
and it was raining, not like the leaves are now,

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.520
and I just ran across the door,

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.520
and it was raining, not like the leaves are now,

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:14.520
and I slipped and fell on the back of my head and knocked myself out.

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.520
Well, then they took me in the room there,

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.520
and I was there for a while,

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:20.520
but I've got to be fair, they had good first aid.

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.520
They did, yes.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:27.520
It often makes me think it was more modern nowadays to what I...

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.520
Do you know what I mean?

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.520
To some of the factories, you know?

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.520
Yes, yes.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.520
Can you remember any of the rules and regulations there,

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.520
were there...

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.520
Did you feel there were rules and regulations or...?

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.520
Well, you weren't allowed to be late,

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.520
you had to be clocking in.

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.520
But there was no really rules,

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.520
I mean, you just had to be... couldn't be late.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.520
I mean, you had to have a good excuse for not being in work.

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.520
But apart from that, there was no really rules,

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:01.520
because everything was fine, you know what I mean?

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.520
You had a good supervisor.

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.520
Great.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.520
Were you ever made aware of kind of health and safety issues

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.520
and stuff like that, or, you know, told to be careful?

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.520
No, there was no health and safety.

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.520
The only thing issue was, as I told you,

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.520
with the temperature with the union, that's the only thing.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.520
There was no health and safety then.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.520
And how was the factory heated?

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.520
Unlit, do you remember?

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.520
I can't remember the heating, but as I said,

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:39.520
it wasn't really cold, but then when we had the bitter cold weather,

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.520
it would be cold, because it was a big...

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.520
How can I explain?

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.520
You know, like the two Asdas, these buildings, what they're called now.

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.520
I can't think of the word now.

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:50.520
The what buildings?

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:52.520
You know, like Asdas, like they build them, these pre...

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.520
What they're called? I can't think of the word.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.520
Pre-fabricated things.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.520
Yeah, you see, that's not the word.

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.520
It was a great big factory, I mean...

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.520
I can't even remember.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:04.520
What about the heat?

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:07.520
All I remember, we were told this time, because it was cold,

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:10.520
if it was below 40, we weren't allowed to work.

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.520
But I can't remember what heating was in there.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.520
I think they had the big long lights, you know.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.520
Because of the sewing, you'd have to have bright lights,

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.520
because of the sewing.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.520
So like strip lighting?

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.520
Yes, yes.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:29.520
Were you really, really worried about the heat?

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:32.520
Were you allowed to kind of chat while you were working?

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.520
Yes, you could chat and sing.

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.520
Yeah, that's what I said, it was relaxed, it was really nice.

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:39.520
And do you remember what you talked about?

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.520
Oh, probably boyfriends and what we...

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.520
You know, youth club and different things.

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:47.520
You know, and music, we talk about the music, like I said,

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:51.520
there'd be certain records we'd like, and we'd talk about that, you know.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.520
Things haven't changed that much then?

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.520
No, it hasn't, no.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.520
Were you allowed to smoke while you were working?

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.520
No, I don't think, no.

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.520
They could smoke, but not in the factory.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:08.520
They could, because obviously, they could smoke in the canteen,

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.520
because I never smoked, so it didn't appeal to me.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.520
But they couldn't smoke in the factory,

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.520
but I think they could smoke in the canteen, you know.

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:25.520
Did you suffer any kind of long-term health issues from working then?

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.520
No, nothing at all.

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:35.520
How did the women treat their fellow male workers?

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:39.520
Fine, they used to laugh about and joke with them, they were fine.

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.520
Okay, okay.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:52.520
Was your husband supportive of you working? Did he mind? Did he want you to work?

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.520
Well, in them days, he did. He just automatically worked, didn't he?

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:58.520
He didn't even think about it.

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:02.520
I mean, once you've had your children, then you never worked,

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.520
because you had to look after your children.

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.520
That's the unfortunate thing of today for the youngsters.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.520
They've got to go to work, and it's a shame,

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.520
because they're missing the bond with their children.

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:16.520
I really don't like that. I really think it's hard.

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.520
Yeah, yeah.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.520
How many days did you work? Did you work weekends?

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:28.520
Monday to Friday, only a week. We didn't work Saturdays.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.520
And do you remember the hours you worked in a day?

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.520
I think we started it.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.520
I don't know if we started at nine.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:44.520
We had our offer lunch annual, because sometimes I used to come home.

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:49.520
And I think we finished at five. I can't.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:55.520
I would think so. I think it was a 40 hour week, so I would have worked out then.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.520
Would that be right then? I'd have got to work it out.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.520
Yes, 95.

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.520
Yes, 95 it was.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.520
And so there were no shifts or anything like that?

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.520
No, no, no shifts.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:16.520
And did you get any overtime, stuff like that?

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:23.520
Sometimes, if they were rushing on her, they wanted certain things out, sometimes you would.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.520
You might have to work an hour or so, that's all.

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:32.520
But not very often. It was mostly because there were so many people there, it was then pretty good.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:40.520
And did you have a holiday allowance with pay?

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:44.520
Yes, I think we had holiday pay.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.520
Do you remember how much you had in a year?

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.520
Oh, I can't remember, no.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.520
And bank holidays, stuff like that?

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.520
Yes, we had bank holidays, yes, we had them off.

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:09.520
Did the factory, did you have sort of different holidays, or was it some factories, especially if the vans were different?

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.520
We used to close down, didn't we, yes.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.520
Did that happen?

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.520
I'm trying to think now, I can't think now, were did it close down?

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.520
I can't really remember, to be honest.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.520
Okay. And did you used to go on holidays?

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:35.520
No, well, no, not really, because in those days you didn't really go on holidays, we didn't.

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:46.520
We didn't, we'd have, when I was at the girls to go on day trips, you know, on the buses, but when we were married, we never, because my husband was in the army, so we didn't go on holidays.

00:37:50.520 --> 00:38:00.520
I would go down with his Nana, that's right, we went down to Puthcall for a week in the caravan. That's the one time that we can say that we had a week's holiday, you know.

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.520
And when was that?

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.520
I don't know, God years.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.520
A couple of years after you were married?

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.520
Before we were married, we went down there.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.520
Oh, before?

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:14.520
Yes, we went down in Spetsbyn, because she wanted to go and we went with her for company, so she could have the caravan, you know.

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:25.520
Great. And were you allowed days off for personal reasons, like funerals or things like that?

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:40.520
I can't remember having days, well when you're younger you don't, you know, there's no funerals really, unless it's immediate family, which I was okay, I did never have that time off for funerals, no. Whether they did, I don't know.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:49.520
Yeah, so you can't remember like having to forego a day's pay for having a day off for personal reasons or anything like that?

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.520
No, no.

00:38:50.520 --> 00:39:01.520
Okay. So you know we were talking about these dinner dances, fantastic, and were they organised by the company or by the workers?

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.520
The company organised them.

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:07.520
And did you pay for those or did the company pay for those?

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:23.520
Do you know, I can't remember, I don't know whether they paid, because friends came, obviously they would have had to pay the friends. Whether we paid or not, I can't really remember. But they were, you know, in them days it was a proper dinner dance, it was lovely, you know.

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:31.520
You've talked about the music, it was like a rock and roll, were they like local bands who played?

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.520
Yes, it was, they usually had a live band there.

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.520
Do you remember any of them?

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:40.520
No, not really. It's a long time back now.

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:43.520
And do you remember what you had to eat then?

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:55.520
Oh gosh, you're joking, no. I know it would be like you'd have soup with you and you'd have your meal in your sweetener. And I don't know if we had after eight minutes and things like that, I don't think we did then.

00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:07.520
It was a three course meal, do you know what I mean? It was a proper dinner, as I say, a dinner dance, which would have to be done properly, you know what I mean?

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.520
And how many times a year would that be?

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.520
Only, I was a Christmas one, I was a Christmas one now.

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:23.520
So, you were allowed to take people?

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:26.520
Yes, friends wanted to come here, but they could come as well.

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:28.520
Right, so who did you take?

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.520
My husband, they took my husband with me.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:33.520
Every time?

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.520
Yes.

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:36.520
Not sort of local friends?

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:42.520
No, because my main friend, Marion, she worked there anyway, she was in the office.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.520
Oh yeah, you said, yeah.

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:57.520
Is there any one event that you remember from your time in the factory, like a visit by a famous person or anything like that?

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:12.520
Well, the only famous person that I know is, I told you, was Lorna Leslie, because she worked with us, you know, and she was a scream, she'd have us all singing, she was always laughing, always laughing, she was, she was really good.

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.520
And what did she go on to do then?

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:21.520
Well, I don't know, because we all split, once the factory closed, that was it, so everybody went.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:29.520
But then she was going to, she started to sing then under Lorna Leslie, that was her name, that was her, that's what she was doing, singing.

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:32.520
So what happened after that, I don't know.

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.520
You don't remember any, does she bring out any records or anything?

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:44.520
Oh, she did shows, I think, she done concerts, she might, obviously she must have done records, because she done shows, you know.

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.520
And you didn't go and see her?

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:48.520
No, no, no.

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:50.520
Okay, great.

00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:01.520
There we are, I'm going to move on to, oh, I'll just ask you this.

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:06.520
Are you in contact with any of your former workmates from Horrocks?

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:12.520
No, unfortunately, no. I've got photographs of them, but no, unfortunately, no.

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.520
Right, oh, right.

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:19.520
Okay, I'll go on, I'll just pause a minute.

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:21.520
Okay.

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:30.520
You mentioned that you went on work trips to the Fire and Porthogol. But did Horrocks put the buses on for those?

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:38.520
Yes, we had to pay, but you know, it was an evening trip like, because I went with my husband.

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:40.520
I don't know what that was.

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.520
Sorry.

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.520
I don't know what that was.

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:50.520
I went with my, there was a bus, I went with my husband, and we went to the Fire and Porthogol.

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:52.520
It was a great night out, you know.

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:58.520
You know, the girls would take their boyfriends and we'd go to Porthogol and watch the fireworks and go on the shows.

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.520
It was just a great night out, you know.

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:03.520
And so was that a kind of annual event on?

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.520
Yes, it was, yes, yes.

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:07.520
On Bonfire Night?

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:09.520
Yes.

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:17.520
Okay, great. So we'll go on then, Rita, to, so you left Horrocks. What year was it again?

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:24.520
What do we say now? Those sixties, maybe six, yes, 59, 60. It was after I got married.

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:26.520
Right.

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:28.520
Yes, that's what you said.

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:41.520
I think it was now. And then, like I said, we had to go to this place on Wesker Street and eventually I found a job in West Canal Wharf.

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:47.520
Now, after working in Horrocks, such a lovely factory, I couldn't believe it.

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:58.520
Because you went in this little door, and as you went in, there was all coal at the back, and then you went up these stairs,

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:08.520
and when you got up to the stairs then, you turned right, and there was this room with, there was only two machines,

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:17.520
and then when I started, there would have been three. The boss, Mr Spencer, and one boy, a great boy, was cutting out.

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:26.520
And we were making school satchels, handbags, and sometimes we'd make purses, but mostly it was school satchels.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:35.520
And there was three girls on the machines, and it was big machines, heavy machines, same as we had in Horrocks, but a bit stronger.

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:42.520
But you had an oily rag, you had to oil a seam, and then machine it.

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:52.520
It was okay, I was nice girls, and we used to chat, and all that business, but after working in Horrocks, it was entirely different,

00:44:53.520 --> 00:45:00.520
because we'd have a break, he'd turn the machines off, and the boss would make the tea, and then we'd have this bowl,

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:08.520
and everybody would wash their hands in this bowl to have a cup of tea, and whatever, the same bowl.

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:21.520
And then this one time, I picked up imbatagol from the oil, I must have had a pimple and scratched in, I had imbatagol on my face, it was dreadful.

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:33.520
I told the boss, that's fine, he said, we've still all washed in this bowl and still use the same towel, which these days you just can't believe.

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:46.520
But it was okay, I enjoyed it there, but then, as I said, I left there then, because my husband was in Germany, and I went to Germany to live then, that's when I finished work completely.

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:51.520
So, can I just ask you, was the factory called Spencer's?

00:45:52.520 --> 00:46:02.520
I'm not sure what it was called, but the boss's name was Mr Spencer, but he used to make school satchels and hambags, purses, but it wasn't a big place, as I said,

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:14.520
there was only three machiners and a boy cutting out on him, so there was only five of us in this, which was the factory, but, you know, I mean, there was a lot to be desired after Horrocks's.

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:23.520
I mean, there was no restroom, no first aid or anything, I mean, I can't even remember where the toilet was, to be honest with you.

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:30.520
You know what I mean, you just can't believe it, he just wore this pinny, white pinny, you just can't believe it.

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.520
Oh, they got away with it in them days.

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:42.520
There was other factories round there, which was, they used to call it the butter factory, and there was another place that used to do bras and knickers.

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:52.520
I tried to get in there, but of course most of our girls had already got in there, so that was my next, and I wanted a sewing job, you know, so that's why I worked there.

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:58.520
Yeah, so was the water in this bowl, was it hot at least?

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:04.520
Yeah, well he'd boil the kettle and put water in and add cold, so we'd all use the same bowl of water.

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:08.520
So did it take you a while to get rid of this impotigo?

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:12.520
Oh yes, it did take me a while, because it was horrible it was.

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:19.520
But I still went to work, see, I told him, but he said, no that's fine, I still wash my hands in the bowl.

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:25.520
You can't believe it, can you? You just can't believe it, but there you are.

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:29.520
So who did he supply with these?

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:34.520
I'd be honest with you, I don't know, all they know is I worked there, so I don't know.

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:39.520
They were school satchels, so whether it was for a shop or, I don't know.

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.520
So how big was the place then?

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:49.520
Only tiny, it was only just one room, that's all it was.

00:47:50.520 --> 00:48:00.520
As I say, there was three of us on the sewing machines, but there was probably four sewing machines, one table for cutting out,

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:09.520
and a little table where he was sat, and we'd have a table in the middle to wash our hands, so it wasn't big.

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:13.520
So how did you feel working there?

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:20.520
Well I enjoyed working with the girls, but I didn't feel as if I was clean there, do you understand me?

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:25.520
After working in Horlickses it was entirely different, you know.

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:28.520
How long were you there then?

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:35.520
I'm not sure, about 18 months I think, because then I went to Germany.

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:40.520
Did you keep in touch with any of those girls then?

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:47.520
No, because the one woman was a lot older than me, and the other girl, no I never.

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:50.520
Do you remember how much you were paid?

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:57.520
No, I can't remember, probably about the same, because it was the same as the other girls.

00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:03.520
I was paid £1,000 a month, and I was paid £1,000 a month.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:07.520
So you were paid £1,000 a month?

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:10.520
Yes, £1,000 a month.

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:12.520
Do you remember how much you were paid?

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:20.520
No, I can't remember, probably about the same, because it was the same type of wages, one lived in M days.

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.520
I'm not sure to be honest.

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:29.520
That's what I was going to ask you as well, could you chat there, could you chat and listen to music?

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:37.520
Yes, we could talk there, of course there was only three of us to chat to, so we used to talk, you know what I mean.

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:42.520
I didn't enjoy it like I did Horixys, you know, the great atmosphere in Horixys.

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:45.520
Where did you go for lunch then?

00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:52.520
We just used to stay in a factory and then I didn't ever come home, because it was in town.

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:59.520
We'd stay there and have a snack, and then start work and then come back. I think, I'm not sure what time I finished then.

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:02.520
I was going to ask what the hours were.

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:13.520
I'm just trying to think what hours they were. It was probably nine till five, but we didn't go out, we stayed in a factory for the hour, you know, just chatting.

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:24.520
Was there an union there?

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:26.520
No, no.

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:30.520
Apart from the impotai, what kind of boss was Mr Spencer?

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:31.520
He was okay.

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:33.520
Quite fair?

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:38.520
He was alright. How can I explain?

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:50.520
He could get a bit moody on times, but as I said, after working in Horixys, nothing seemed the same, you know what I mean.

00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:57.520
I wasn't as happy there as I was. I mean, I worked there because I needed the money, you know what I mean.

00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:03.520
I got on because they said there were only two other girls to chat to.

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:13.520
But it wasn't the atmosphere and you weren't laughing and joking like you were in Horixys. It was like a life, but there it was work and that was it. You know what I mean?

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:21.520
Did you have holidays there? Do you remember?

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:30.520
I probably did, but I can't really remember because we wouldn't have gone away then, so I'm not sure about that.

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:35.520
Obviously we had bank holidays and things like that, which they did then.

00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:40.520
And any social life?

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:48.520
Well, as I said, I used to go to a youth club. That's where I met my husband. I used to go to the cinema.

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:52.520
But what I mean is there was nothing organised by the school?

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:57.520
Oh, in the factory? No, nothing at all like Horixys.

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:06.520
You say you weren't particularly happy there, but were you bored? Was it monotonous?

00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:11.520
Well, I wouldn't say I'm bored because I used to like sewing.

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:21.520
But I used to get a bit fed up sometimes because there was no laughter and joking. It was just work and doing the same thing.

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:28.520
He wasn't the happiest person, so it wasn't as nice.

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:32.520
How did you get to work there then?

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.520
I used to catch the bus.

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:36.520
Sorry, can you say that again?

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:38.520
I used to catch the bus to work.

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:40.520
So no bike into town then?

00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:46.520
No, I'd catch the bus then. The bus on the corner would take me straight to the monument. I'd catch the bus home then.

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:49.520
What was West Canow off like in those days?

00:52:50.520 --> 00:53:01.520
There was plenty of work there because, like I said, the bus used to be packed going to work and coming home because they'd be going to the place where they made the bras and the knickers, and then there was the butter factory.

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:09.520
So there was a lot of people finishing work at the same time. You'd all be on the bus. You'd be busy. You'd chat to people on the bus.

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:14.520
Did you like working in town at all?

00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:18.520
I didn't mind because it wasn't that far.

00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:27.520
So you left because your husband…

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:47.520
Well, he was stationed in Germany and I was just becoming pregnant then and we went over to Germany to live. So that's why I left. How long he went on after, I don't know the factory. Like I said, it was only a small factory.

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:50.520
And how long were you in Germany for?

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.520
For 18 months to 2 years.

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:59.520
I'll just put this off for a minute. I'll just finish off now.

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:05.520
So did you ever go back and work anywhere else, Rita?

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:27.520
No. Well, I had three children and then when my youngest was about six or seven, I started in St Paul's School, which used to be the Nash as a dinner lady, and I worked there 38 years. I retired now last Christmas. I've been off this year, but I loved it. I love working with children.

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:48.520
I think if I'd have had my time over again, like they have all these opportunities today, I would have worked with children because I do like working with children and handicapped children as well. So I think I enjoy doing what I did, but I think after working with children, I think that's what I would have loved to have done.

00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:59.520
Great. Looking back over your life and looking back to Horroxes, what would you say?

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:18.520
Oh, I enjoyed Horroxes. Don't get me wrong, he was lovely. I did enjoy it. As I say, they looked after their staff and it was a good factory. It was. Now, I do like working with children, but I'm not saying I did enjoy Horroxes. It was really good.

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:21.520
Brilliant. Thank you very much.

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:23.520
Thank you.
