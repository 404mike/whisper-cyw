00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.560
And in July 66, I went on Ulpan to improve my Hebrew in Jerusalem.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.880
There I met my wife, Aggy, who was a pupil in the same class as me, a student in the same class.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.960
So that was 66. That was a five-month intensive Ulpan course.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.240
And we graduated together in December.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:35.840
And I was obliged by Gluckman to study an immigrant village.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:45.040
So we put our heads together, Aggy and I, and decided that we would try and find a village.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.680
It wasn't easy. People didn't want to accept. You're poking your nose around.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.880
And some villages we didn't want to live in, even if they would accept us.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.800
But with Aggy's languages, Hungarian and Romanian, and now Hebrew,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.880
and I had French and Spanish and Hebrew,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.400
we decided to look for a village not too far from where her parents lived,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.240
which was in Ramley, new immigrant housing, very modest housing.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.160
And we chose a village if they would have us on the border.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.960
I wanted to see what the impact of living on the border was.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.080
And if it was possible, a multi-ethnic village with Jews from different countries.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.640
And we found one.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.360
And the two dominant languages in this village were Hungarian and Romanian.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:44.880
And Aggy's charm with the village administrator certainly facilitated entry.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.480
And so in January, 67,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.520
I entered the village and rented a room from a Romanian landlady

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.280
whose son was a powerful local politician.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.040
And we got married in April 67,

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.360
which was five days before the outbreak of the Six-Day War.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.600
And we've integrated quite nicely.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.600
People were beginning to...

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.520
They were suspicious of me as an Englishman,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.800
and what's he doing walking around the border, which I did,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.040
and looking around the terrain.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.840
They took some time before they accepted.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:37.680
But the key factor in our being accepted was the outbreak of the Six-Day War.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.880
In late May, I received a letter from the British Embassy, which I registered with,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.480
to say that we can't guarantee your safety.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.000
You choose to stay at your own peril.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.520
And of course, all the villagers knew this

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.640
because the post was distributed around a tree in the village.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.240
And the mobile post office threw a pile of letters onto the ground.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.280
And they could see, they could read, the British Embassy on the front.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.760
And they said, oh, I suppose you'll be going, won't you?

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.200
You know, they'd survivors of the Holocaust.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.920
Many of them had tattoos on their arm.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:21.320
First time I'd seen a tattoo on a number on a Jewish survivor of the Holocaust.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.640
And Aghi and I discussed it.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.600
We had no children, so it was an easier decision.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.520
And we said, no, we're staying.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.640
We're staying on the border.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.560
I have written about this in my book on the village and the state.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.720
And I don't want to go over it all again.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.000
But we stayed, and I was given a job.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.680
Of course, the men, the able-bodied men, were mobilized into the reserve army.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.600
And quite a few of the younger boys in the village with whom I played football

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.800
said, why aren't you in the army, the Israeli army?

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.280
I said, well, I'm a British citizen.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.960
I'm a Jew, but I'm not an Israeli citizen.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.120
So I was trained to be the village dairyman.
