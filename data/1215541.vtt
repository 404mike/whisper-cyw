00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
You're listening to Rhiannon talking about how she keeps in touch with her best friend who lives in South Africa.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.320
My best friend is Natasha.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.000
She lives in South Africa.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.400
She's the bestest friend I've ever, ever, ever had.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.760
She's like a family member to me.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.760
We do everything together.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.240
We laugh together.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.720
We share stories together.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.440
We enjoy each other's company.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.000
We just get on really well.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.200
And so how does that work now that you're living in Newport?

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.280
We speak to each other every day, probably without fail.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.960
And we just have a laugh together, as I said.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.920
We just have fun together.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.960
It's just great.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.760
I just wish she was here.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.040
And now that you aren't able to see her as regularly, do you talk on the telephone or how do you...?

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.480
We are in touch via WhatsApp.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.840
We message each other every day.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.320
We, again, as I said before, we message people.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.800
We message each other asking how our day was.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:37.640
And yes, it's good to have that communication with friends.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.240
And because I think it's very important to have friends.
