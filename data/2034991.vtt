Other than the rock scene in music, Newport was well known for reggae.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And we used to have music called the blues.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And they would have a derelict house, have a generator outside, and they would play the music.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
People would come from Birmingham and London, all over the place to hear the sounds.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:55.000
These was an unusual venue to listen to music, because basically you were in pitch darkness in a house.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And the only lights were in the kitchen where they cooked things like cow foot soup, goat curry, and they sold their alcohol.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I have many people come up to me today and say, my father always told me he used to come to Newport for the blues.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:34.000
One gentleman said the first time he came to Newport, his father sent him down to go to a ladies funeral.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I said Mrs White. He said that's right, she was synonymous around the country and she had a cafe in Pill called Silver Sands.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
People around the country knew this lady. They got their food.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And I think on the quiet, she was one of the main people that brought the reggae music into Newport.
