Cardiff Carnival 25th anniversary project.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.400
Interviewer, Steve Fletcher.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.040
Interviewee, Cammie Nevins.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.320
The location of the interview is the Swicker office,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.840
and today's date is the 12th of October 2015.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.800
For the record, Cammie, would you be kind enough to spell your name in four?

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.880
I don't mind. It's K-E-M-I, Nevins, N-E-V-I-N-S.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.680
Cammie, tell us when and how did you first become involved in the Cardiff Carnival?

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.280
I think it was about 2003, and my friend in mind, Mary Ann, who was involved in it,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.040
just pop along. Contains a community centre. It's good fun. There's loads of people there.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.000
You can bring the kids. They can do some activities. So I thought, oh, great. I was working

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.080
then. I was still nursing and I was working nights. So I went along, and next thing I know,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.960
we're in the full throes of making costumes, of practising dance routines. It was absolutely

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.880
wild, but it was memorable. I loved it. And I must confess, it was actually back in 1993,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.720
not 2003. Oh, sorry, 1993. I was in a dementia setting.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.280
And I remember that you were certainly one of the lead. It was a group of angels, wasn't it?

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.680
Yeah. Yeah. We had all white costumes with white wings, which we made out of, I think it might have

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.400
been some sort of bamboo-y, bendy wood. And we had to thread metres and metres and metres of white

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.960
material through them. They were quite big and quite high. And then a full white costume as well.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.920
And it had to be made so that you could securely sort of strap to your body.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.920
Got it. Got it. And of course, your choreographer, your dance tutor, your,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.240
what can I say, your inspiration was Mary Ann Roberts. Yeah. Originally from Trinidad and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.640
residence in Cardiff. And if I remember correctly, there was a climactic battle between your

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.920
virginal white angelic group and a group of, what can I say, water pistol, well,

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.120
they were pump action shotgun type water pistols. Hooligans. Hooligans. They were devils.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.040
Yeah. So we were the angels. Yeah. So what exactly happened to you on the steps of the

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.720
National Museum? Well, we were there and we'd done the dance routine, which was really cool.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.960
And there's all of us, there's kids there, there's adults there, the whole sort of generational

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.600
thing going on. And then we were squirted with this red blood. You all died, didn't you? Yeah,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.320
we did. That was the end of us really. But it was a brilliant way to go in a brilliant location.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.600
Not quite the end of the story because despite the fact that we had practised to make sure that

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.920
the red dye, that the devils were pumping all over your beautiful white costumes. Yeah.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.840
In fact, didn't dye the steps of the iconic National Museum of Wales. I mean,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.240
when I got permission from the director to use the space for our finale, I signed on behalf of

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:04.080
SWCCA a very big legal document, an indemnity document in which the company undertook to return

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:12.960
the fabric of the building intact and unaltered in any way. And that night, you know, 1993,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.680
night mass, the performance was in the evening. Obviously, we had lights and we had pyro as well.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:25.600
Some naked flame before health and safety was invented and the rest of it. But unbeknownst to

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:34.560
me, in some enthusiastic devil, rather than going with the approved and tested weak strength red dye,

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:42.160
had taken it upon themselves to add volumes of more food colouring and dye to the blood type

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:50.000
stuff that was in the water pistols and the water guns. And so the next morning after the carnival,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I received a phone call from the director of the National Museum of Wales, who asked me to come and

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.960
meet him urgently on the steps of the National Museum of Wales in Cattays. Naturally, I scooted

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:10.480
over there and as I approached the steps in sunlight, I could see they appear to be dappled

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.640
with something. And then to my utter horror, I discovered that, yeah, the carnival had in fact

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:25.360
dyed a goodly proportion of the steps of the National Museum bright red, which of course was

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.320
a disaster. I mean, the idea that you can't imagine that. Yeah, the look on my face. Well,

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.320
to cut a long story short, the director of the museum, who was fully aware that we were a small

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:43.680
scale community funded organisation, decided to wait three months to see whether or not

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.120
the rain and wind and natural weathering would in fact take away these marks. I used to pop

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.520
along once a week and sort of spit them before, try and rub them with my feet. It was rather pathetic.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.440
But three months in and good news for everyone. Otherwise, I'm afraid the carnival would have

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:08.560
died an ignomal die based death way back then. I hasten to add that the marks had

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.680
virtually gone and the director very kindly said that he would accept that I'd returned the steps

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.320
largely as they were. And we shook hands and kind of carnival went on to even more wonderful things.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.080
Absolutely. It's always nice to put things in context. At the point in which you were describing

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.840
being in the carnival in 1993, you were a nurse in the Royal Great Hospital. Yeah, I was doing

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:42.560
agency night shift. So you're working at night? With my costume in tow, my accessory and to the

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.480
great delight or sort of wonderment of the rest of the staff I was on with, I'd produce this in my

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:55.360
break and start sewing and sticking on sequins and weaving material. And I'd actually ask people

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.480
they'd like to get involved as well. I thought, well, no point in just sitting there, you know,

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.360
with your coffee. We've done all our bits and you know, you have odd bits of time free in between

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.360
the observations and settling patients. So I had people helping me really picking up needles,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.080
the glue gun. So we got it all done. It was brilliant. That was a fabulous, I have to say,

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:20.720
brilliant, brilliant job. I mean, I can still see you there in my mind. Of course, you moved on from

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:28.800
nursing and now I certainly would like those in the future to know. So Chemie's, the rest of us,

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:37.520
the queen of all things vegetarian. It's like a food carnival really, the cafe. We try to encourage

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.280
people to try different things. We like experimenting as cooks and it is like a carnival,

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.280
different colors, different textures. It's like stuff from around the world. And it's just good

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:56.240
fun. I enjoy it as much as I do dancing in the streets, dancing in the kitchen. Chemie,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.680
thank you very much for that and bring this back to one of the earliest carnivals.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.960
I hereby declare you a carnival hero. Thank you very much. Thanks, Steve.
