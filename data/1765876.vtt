00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So my name's Flavia Humphreys, we're just outside Clamvutherlin High School and I'm here with...

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
With Gary Tatlow.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And Gary's going to talk a little bit about when he came here to give a talk. So what was your talk about?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:27.000
My talk was about the Olympic Games. When I lived in Cyprus I went to America

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and I got a gold in the 400 metres and a silver in the long jump.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I was very competitive and I came first in the 400 metres and second in the long jump.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So what was the experience like of training for the Olympics? How much training did you do?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Not a lot but it was quite experience and very, very good training.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Brilliant. So in America, where did you stay for the Olympics?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I stayed in a university.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Okay. And good food?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Yes, the food was very, very good.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Brilliant. So did they have training facilities while you were there?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
No, we just did running and then trained.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Fantastic. Brilliant. So what was it like standing on the podium?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It felt really, really, really good. It felt really, really nice.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Standing on the podium, winning the first gold medal for Cyprus. It was really, really good.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Extraordinary. So did you know the national anthem for Cyprus? Did you have to sing it?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
No, we didn't have any anthems.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Okay. Right. And what about the opening ceremony? What did they have?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:17.000
They had Stevie Wonder and some Martyrs' Brew of all the teams that were going into the Olympics.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Brilliant. And any fireworks?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
No, there was no fireworks at the start but I think we had fireworks at the end.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Fantastic.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So do they have the Olympic flame torch at the Special Olympics?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Yes, they did.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Okay. Fantastic. And then did you ever go to any other Olympics after that?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:57.000
In 1998, I went to Athens, which is Greece. And then in 1999, I went to America, as I said.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And in year 2001, I went to Hungary.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Oh, wow. So what were you doing in Hungary?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I think it was the 100 meters and the 200. I can't remember.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Oh my goodness.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I got a silver and a bronze there. And I did, in Athens, I did the 100 meters and I got a bronze medal for the 100 meters.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Goodness me. That's extraordinary. Did you do London Olympics or help with London?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
No, I didn't.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Did you go to it?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
No, I didn't.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
No, not that one. Do you like watching it on the telly?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Yes, I do.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Yeah. Do you think it's changed much in the last 10, 20 years since you were there?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
No, I don't think so. No.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
No, it's fairly similar. So when you came to the school, did you talk to a big group of children or just a smaller group?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
The whole school. The whole school.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
What sort of questions did the children ask?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000
How did you feel when you won the gold medal? And I thought, I said, I felt great.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Yeah, wonderful. And do you think you've inspired any other children to start running?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I don't know on that answer.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Hopefully, that'd be nice, wouldn't it?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Right, yeah.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So you have still, up until lockdown, still been running. Who were you running with?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I was running with a team in Newtown. I can't remember the name of the group.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
So was that just sort of in the evenings?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Yeah, it was just one evening a week.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Oh, OK. And do you do long distances or just sort of sprints?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Long distances, like going around Newtown, running around the town and things like that.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Oh my goodness. So are there any other sports you've ever done or been interested in?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
No, just athletics.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
You just like athletics generally?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Yes, I do.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So you say you did the long jump. What about high jump?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
No, not high jump. No.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
No, just long jump.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Just long jump and running, that's all.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Oh, fantastic. So do you think you'll be able to run again soon?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
I hope so. Yes, when the team start back up again.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Yeah, brilliant. That'd be great.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
So am I right in thinking you did some other projects at the school with Mencap?

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Did you do a gardening, come here for gardening?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Yes, we did.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Yeah, what sort of garden were you doing?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I was on the allotment garden.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Oh, lovely. Yeah.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Brilliant. And did the children ever help with that?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Some of the children did, yeah.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Yeah, fantastic. Thank you for that. It was really interesting.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Congratulations on all your medals.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Okay.
