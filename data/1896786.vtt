00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.960
Eventually, I got to Camaden in charge of a small detachment of about 20 men.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.940
Now we had the most ridiculous duty.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:28.880
We were to dig holes into the soil in various places all over the county, into these almost

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:39.840
men-high holes where inserted wooden kiosks and a seat.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:55.840
The idea being that men would be stationed in these holes, connected to each other by telephone, in the case of an invasion.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.800
We did the job. Every morning we set off on a lorry and went to another place all over Camaden shore.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:16.800
And wondering why, because who on earth, if it were Hitler or one of his commanders, would envisage an invasion of Britain by starting in South Wales?

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.800
They would have to come all around South West England, wouldn't they?

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.760
Well, the Germans never tried it and we don't know.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:34.760
I'm often wondering whether they're still in various places all over Camaden shore.
