00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I was the summer warden at Kemlin in 1994.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.120
And I'm looking at a picture from then

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.600
of somebody looking out at the turns from the ridge

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.120
and they're lying down on the shingle,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.720
looking up over the top of the ridge.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.560
And as I remember, that was mostly what we used to do then.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.560
And it makes me think about how the shape of the ridge

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.640
has changed.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.080
And I know the ridge has always changed over time

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.760
and it was created in the 19th century by a storm.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.280
And it's always been a kind of dynamic thing anyway.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.040
But looking at this picture brings back the memory

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.400
of a ridge that had a different kind of profile

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.520
and there were other changes associated with that.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.240
I can't remember who this guy was.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.480
I think he was one of the people that came

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.040
and helped volunteer for a day.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.960
And we're looking out at the turn islands.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.560
But I think one thing that people sometimes say

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.240
and that I certainly notice as someone who's been

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.800
going back to Kenlin for many, many years

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.680
and people who come back after time,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.120
they feel that the ridge,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.280
that you somehow are closer to the turns than you used to be.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.760
And I think that's actually the case.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.760
I think the ridge is moving slowly inland

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
only by a matter of inches each year, perhaps.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.320
But as well as that phenomenon,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.040
there's also the thing of how the ridge is shaped

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.040
by particular weather patterns that you get,

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.440
particularly what winter storms you get

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.120
and what direction they come from.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.200
That can really change the shape of the ridge.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.200
And I think my sense is that now the ridge,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.200
there's very little space between the top of the ridge

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.320
and the high tide mark.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.480
That is, once you get to the high tide mark,

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.480
you're basically almost at the top of the ridge

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.480
and there's not much space in between.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.480
And that's got implications both for how people access,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.040
where you put the rope line to keep people

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.840
on the seawood side of the ridge

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.840
and also for what ground nesting birds make use of the ridge

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.680
because back in 1994 when I was the warden,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.680
we had both several pairs of nesting ring plovers

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.720
on the ridge, some oyster catchers nesting on the ridge

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.000
and also at that time, some Arctic terns still nesting

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.880
on the ridge itself.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.720
And that's a change from now.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.440
Now we don't really have,

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.640
I don't think we had any successful ground nesters

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.240
on the ridge last summer.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.280
I think we had a couple of pairs.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.200
We've had some ring plovers nesting on the truyn

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.840
or trying to in recent years,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.320
but not on the ridge as far as I know successfully.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.000
And certainly the terns haven't even tried to nest

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.680
on the ridge for many years.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.320
And I'm wondering whether this is related to the shape

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.080
of the ridge and also perhaps increased visitor pressure,

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.080
visitors and dogs just because they're close

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.120
to where the birds want to nest.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.120
And that space between the top of the high tide mark

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.960
and the top of the ridge has also been squeezed

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.960
just by the effect of probably of sea level rise,

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.200
which is to do with climate change we know.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.880
And this sort of incremental effect of that,

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.000
but also perhaps the effect on weather patterns.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And I think in the last,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.200
my sense is in the last sort of five or 10, five years,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.840
there's been more winter storms

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.320
that have come from different directions.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.000
So we've had these north or northeasterly storms,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.600
which goes straight into Kremlin

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.600
because Kemenin's kind of faces,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.760
the bay itself is kind of open

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.480
to the northeasterly direction from the open sea.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.440
And that meant that the ridge has been,

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.400
has taken more of a battering from that direction

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.000
and has even been overtopped by a couple of particularly,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.920
you know, ferocious winter storms.
