00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
So on a weekend, I'm involved in a rugby club

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.320
and the boys are brilliant.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.680
They didn't know I was autistic,

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.640
however, the captain did let me say anything

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.640
because he's a manager for, not residential,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.560
oh, what do they call it?

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.300
Supported living.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.360
For adults with autism, disabilities,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.040
I knew I was autistic right away.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.920
And I didn't know this until about two years ago

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.680
and I'd been in the club now five years.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.520
And the boys said,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.400
oh, Griff did know you was autistic

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.440
until like two, three years through.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.000
I'm like, oh, right, well, I can.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.560
They said, because Ice was captain,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.600
they called him Ice because he's a massive love of Ice cubes,

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.520
that's why they called him Ice.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.680
Yeah, it's really weird.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.240
And they said, boys, go easy on Griff.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.560
It might take some banter, but he's autistic

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.000
and just don't take the mic or nothing.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.360
And they're like, oh, right, okay.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.400
So they didn't know nothing about autism.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.560
So Ulfine, my best mate,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.400
came up to me and he said,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.600
Griff, what is autism then?

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.200
So what I'd done, I'd print off a four sheet of the spectrum

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.140
and I kind of broke it down for him.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.320
And he said, you know so much about it.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.480
I said, well, I made a joke,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.520
I said, well, because it is that I've got it like,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.360
you know, he said, oh, he said, you would never guess that.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.720
I said, well, have I got to look autistic then?

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.360
And I still get that stigma now.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.160
And he said, society shouldn't be like that.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.480
We shouldn't be thinking, oh, is that person autistic?

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.320
Isn't that person autistic?

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.240
Does that person look like he's got a disability?

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.320
He said, it shouldn't be like that.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.480
There shouldn't be no barriers, there shouldn't be no stigma.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.840
It should all be who we want to be

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.040
and live life like it is.
