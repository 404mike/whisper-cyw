00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.080
Walking in felt magical, like an underground lair. Even now I'm grown up, I still visit

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.280
there. I had my ears pieced in a dodgy shop a few years ago. The small pet shop full of

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.920
life was my favourite place to go. Little hamsters flat out in their wheels. Fish swimming

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.240
as the owner made deals. Now I play Pokemon on days off in the gaming shop. Retro Games

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.720
do all stuff PS4 or Xbox. Donkey Kong all day long. Llanelli Market is my home from

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.080
home and I'll never forget the memories of my days spent running round the underground

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.080
magical market.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.160
Vintage shops gone to waste, other shops replaced. Few brothers building a business together,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.360
but nothing lasts forever. Coco Blush Modern for now, Fashion Chains is all about eyebrows.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.840
We're working collectively to solve the mystery of our history. So much praise about English

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.240
Lions but about Welsh Dragons.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.120
The ringing of a rifle shot smashes into throat bleeding badly. This did not take place

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.120
in Wales when this was a hundred years ago in Llanasau.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.120
Tin Plate Town, first ever national rural strike. Battle raged for two days and nights.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.720
John Jack John and Leonard Walsall, killed by bullet of industrial struggle.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.720
The Great Unrest, authorities feared revolution. Virtual military occupation. Mass struggle

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.560
by dockers, rail workers and miners. Workers sweeping aside and eating alive their leaders.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.560
Class revolt and these men's murders provoked further disturbance.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.560
Wiped off from history, the gifts of the dead and crumbling. We hesitate to start in honor

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.560
of our memory. They deserve an apology, but it is evidence with your poetry.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.560
Factory floor ignored and neglected. We need archives of our women's history awareness.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.560
Extremely important Welsh women. Our heritage takes different forms. Women's roles are vital,

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.560
guaranteed, devised and forgotten. Let's fill the streets with statues that celebrate.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.560
And balance.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.560
Llanelli Market, I had my hair cut there once. Now I have my hair cut on a double-decker bus.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.560
Space and freedom open to all. Billionaire owners, big and small.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:12.560
The market. Regular customers, family business, personal touch. People of the market surround us.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.560
Stood proud for a century and a half, beating heart of the town, filling our stories and

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.560
memories of this market we should be proud.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.560
Walking into town, sun in the sky. Cameras in operation, no smoking sides.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.560
Seals in the sky, flying high. Under-dress, hair, beauty, style.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.560
Ride the bike fast, speeding past. Speakers in the grass, they like to blast.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.560
Walk around Llanelli, this is my town.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.560
It's feelin' this in the air, put your phone down.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:05:03.560
Put your phone down.
