WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.800
Today is Friday the 17th of November 2023 and we are in Fun at the Fair or of the Fair?

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.320
Fun of the Flair.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.180
Fun of the Flair has been hard again.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.960
Could you introduce yourselves?

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.920
I am Bethan Mererik-Kent and I'm Creative Director of Abicon and our Animation Group.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.960
And I'm Rowan Alleyne with Bethan.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:38.240
I'm co-founder of Kedicom Animation Group and Abicon under the umbrella of WOW, Wales

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.140
One World Film Festival.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.880
So how did you both meet each other?

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:55.360
Well, I've always had a fascination with animation ever since I was a kid.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:04.320
I grew up with Disney and then it gradually came to anime and Japanese animation.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:14.760
And we kind of met because I wore a Sprite t-shirt since I'm a fan of My Neighbor Totoro

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.680
is my favorite Ghibli film.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:32.640
And yeah, I wore the t-shirt and I'm very much confident in anime at the moment.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:46.440
And like I said, I met Rowan because of a t-shirt and you were working part-time with

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.240
learning disabilities at the time?

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.120
Yeah, at the time I'd recently moved back to Cardigan, which is where I grew up in here

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.280
as well.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:04.080
And I started to work for ClinV Carefob and I was supporting a gentleman who was coming

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.640
along to Gateway Clubs, which you're a key part in.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.640
Yeah, I am.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.560
So really we would just be there and hanging out and socializing.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:24.000
And I spotted this young woman with a Totoro t-shirt on and I was like, you like Ghibli?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.720
I like Ghibli.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.440
And that was kind of...

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.400
Our conversation was endless.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.320
We talked about a lot of things.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:40.720
And one of the main things is because I've been going to London Comic Con and anime conventions

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.480
my teenager years.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.200
And I always thought, why do I have to come to Comic Con in London even though I still

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.200
do it?

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.240
I still go to London Comic Con.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:04.880
I just thought, why not have it here in Cardigan, my home county?

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.560
And there's a lot of buzz.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.520
There are anime fans in Cardigan.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.840
There's thousands of us, I think.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.320
And so we were talking about that, weren't we?

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.320
Yeah.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.200
And I mean, the reason I realized, well, I recognized the characters on Beth Ann's t-shirt

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:30.600
was because, well, A, I worked for a film festival, freelance.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:37.400
And B, when I was a student, I went to Japan and I studied Japanese language and culture.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.680
So in those days, it was probably more of a rarity to have anime fans.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.200
Yeah, but now it's mainstream now.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.520
It's the most popular media.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:56.200
I think it's even beaten comic books and DC and stuff like that because I'm not going

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.200
into that dilemma.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.920
That dilemma, it's just that it's mainstream now.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.960
But it's like a real conversation starter, isn't it?

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.520
What anime do you like?

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.720
You used to ask, what music do you like?

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.960
But now these days, it's like, what anime are you into?

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.640
And then you can kind of get an idea of what level people are on, don't you?

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.120
It brings people together, doesn't it?

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.120
Yeah.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.120
Common interest.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.160
Yeah, but there are still people that probably see what kind of music you're into as well.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.160
Yeah, true.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.360
Yeah, true, true.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.640
So yeah, we got to know each other.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.880
It was quite gradual, wasn't it, over the course of a few months?

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.880
Yeah.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:43.040
And then I think I came to Bethan with a bit of a proposal, really.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.040
Yeah.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.280
Because I heard about her ideas for Habacon.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.280
Yeah.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.480
And I said, well, let's see if we can do it as part of the festival.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.280
So we made it happen.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.480
We made it happen.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.360
It was really joyful.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.320
We've been doing animation for how many years now?

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.080
So that was 2018, I believe, that we started.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.080
We must have met in 2017.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.080
Yeah, we did.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.480
But our first project was 2018, I think.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.240
Yeah, our first project.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.280
And we kept going.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.280
Even through COVID.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.120
Yeah, definitely through COVID.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.120
It was like the most important thing, really, to keep it going.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.120
Yeah.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.280
Because the second year of Habacon was, unfortunately, we had to unfortunately cancel because we

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.600
had to do two.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.760
Because I know a lot of my friends are disabled and who have medical problems.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.920
And I didn't want to cause them to be severely ill.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.720
So it was a heavy heart.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:06:04.600
And mid of the 2020, I uploaded a video on Facebook saying that we were postponing or

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.600
I said postponing, but we really cancelled it further along the line.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:17.960
Saying that we postponed Habacon because we don't want anybody to get severely sick.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.640
But we did open Habacon early on this year.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.640
Yeah, we did.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:30.360
So we came back for our second in-person Habacon this year in 2023.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.000
But we've been doing things throughout that time, haven't we?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.880
We've made other films.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.960
We've done screenings and stuff like that.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.960
Yeah, true.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.480
We've done screenings at Small World Theatre.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.080
How many films have we made now?

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.440
Do you remember?

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.600
I think we made three.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.640
And sort of some unpolished ones.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.200
Yeah, unpolished ones.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.840
Your most recent one was called Wild Words.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.280
Wild Words.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:15.160
We did some animation on poetry about wild animals.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.640
Wild animals here in Wales or fictional.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.200
I think there was a unicorn and a dragon.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.960
And I did a bunny.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.680
Bethan did a bunny.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.200
We had a worm, a wriggling worm.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:35.720
We had elves and voles.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:43.600
What we're trying to do with our animation is to bring awareness to certain topics like

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.560
animals, the environment.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:54.880
And the most, one of our probably most proudest ones was Tweeters Equally, where we talked

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.120
about our disability rights.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:03.000
Yeah, and we connected it all with wider, like human rights as well.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.320
It's obviously intersectional.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.720
And that's something I've noticed with Abacon is that a lot of people who are, so from the

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:17.520
LGBTQ community, are attracted to Abacon and interested in anime.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.160
So there's a lot of crossover.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.240
Yeah, we're all inclusive with different types of people.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:28.200
It doesn't matter if you are with a disability or you're LGBT or anything else.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.720
Or you could be a complete norm or identifying as a norm.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.720
Yeah.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.640
But it doesn't matter.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:44.480
And we opened with, we also catered to the old and the young.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.640
I think we had a lot of children, some families.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.800
And that's good because...

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.000
That's been the wonderful thing, I think.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.520
The public facing events that we've done together.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:06.120
Because Bethan obviously is creative director, center stage, but you're doing it for everybody.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.920
Yeah, I'm doing it for everyone.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:14.640
I just want people to be happy and have fun because I know how bleak the world is at the

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.640
moment.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:21.760
And I just want to get them to stay cleared of the problems of the world and just have

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:30.080
some fun and just live, like I said in Tweeters equally.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.720
Life is colorful and bright and we should embrace that.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.720
Yeah.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.880
Sure, there's going to be the cloudy judgment of reality and stuff like that and problems

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.000
and things I really don't want to get into.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.320
And one of the examples of those sort of colorful and bright things, I think, are your costumes.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.320
Yeah.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:56.000
I am a cosplayer and I do cosplay as different anime characters.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.840
What's your favorite one?

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:05.600
Oh, I was really proud recently of this, like, Whales from Italia.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:13.240
And it's one of my favorites, but I realized that the anime and the fandom was dying down

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.880
because of new animes that are popping up.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:29.520
But I'm into two other big anime and things at the moment, like Twisted Wonderland and

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.840
Hypnosis Mike.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:36.880
But I really think that I was really proud on my costume this year and I'm really proud

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.280
to be a cosplayer.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.560
Do you cosplay?

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:52.000
I think she only cosplayed once and that was Tombo from Kiki's Delivery Service at first.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.960
Were the people at the con dress up?

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.960
Yeah, we...

00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.520
Oh, yeah, I like it when people dress up.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:07.160
I think I saw different types of people at our first con that I recognized from anime.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:16.160
I think there was a Darby from My Hero Academia and lots of other anime characters, but it's

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.280
not just anime, it's just geeky thing in general.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:26.480
Yeah, so it's one of the features of the day about the con, is the cosplay competition.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.920
So at the end of the day, we'd announce the winners.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.320
So that's always been lots of fun.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:39.120
And you involve other people that way because people are attracted to come and cosplay,

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.800
even if they haven't been part of the group previously.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:50.960
Yeah, and we have actually broadened our horizon with the animation group, because it's not

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.960
just in Carradine.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:59.880
I think we have somebody in Cardiff and some people in the north.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.280
That came about in lockdown.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:09.640
So in lockdown, when we had to cancel the second Abacon, we took the money we would

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.500
have spent on that.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.720
People generously didn't hold us to our contracts with them.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.120
It was really nice.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:24.200
And we had funding from the National Lottery and they said, you do whatever is best for

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.900
the people that you're serving.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.240
So we decided eventually to keep going on Zoom, didn't we?

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.360
And I think it was one of the best things that we've done.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.040
We still did it even after lockdown.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.040
We're still doing Zoom.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.280
It's so successful.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:46.760
It's not right for everybody, but there is something I think for some people who have

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:52.240
difficulty in a group setting and who might sit in the corner and be quiet, can suddenly

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.320
come alive through a Zoom call.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.920
I don't mean come alive, that sounds really derogatory, sorry.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.880
But I mean just really seem much more confident on screen.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:08.480
And that's really been something that we've picked up on.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.520
And so we think it's worthwhile continuing with the Zooms.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.960
But we've also returned to meeting in person because a lot of people for whom Zoom is actually

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.960
really challenging.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.960
So we've got a bit of a balance going.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:20.960
We've got a bit of a balance.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:25.720
But it's meant that we can invite people from outside of Carrot's Oceans to come and be

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.920
part of it all.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:33.000
And we have really talented people in our circle.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Amazing.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000
They're talented.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.840
Their drawings are amazing.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.560
We're just trying to bring them out of their shells basically.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.160
And everybody's got a unique style.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:50.880
And we've seen people even develop their styles over the course of the past few years.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:51.880
Yep.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:57.760
I think I'm the most improved because my drawings are getting way more better now.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.080
What's your style, Bethan?

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:05.160
My style is the cute style, the kawaii style.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.040
Yeah, 100%.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:20.080
With the films that you've made already, how do you make them?

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:31.880
So we do a stop motion kind of style, not like with the clay kind of like or art men

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.400
or anything like that.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.720
We usually use paper and stuff because it's much easier.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:42.360
I doubt they would ever do clay.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:46.040
Would we or is it way too advanced?

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.960
I don't think clay is way too advanced.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.840
I just think we've got used to using paper.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.840
Yeah, we've been using paper.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.120
We did go on a claymation workshop once.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.120
Do you remember?

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.120
Yeah, we did.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.920
We went down to Kotatsu Festival of Japanese Animation in Cardiff.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:10.440
We went on a trip down there and there was an amazing animator who came from Japan.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:15.480
Then he ran the workshop and there must have been like 20, 30 people in there plus a little

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.680
group of Mencap Kerozegi'an members came down from Cardigan.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.560
That was a really fun day.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.840
Yeah, that was really fun.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.680
You made some really beautiful stuff that day.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:34.080
But no, we haven't done so much of it in our workshops.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:42.560
If you imagine a person, then you think about all the parts that a person would move, so

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:49.600
their hands would move separately from their arms, from their body and their head.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.640
You would design your character, wouldn't you?

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:59.240
Then you break all those bits down into individual parts to make a puppet, like a paper puppet.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:04.280
You can make that move with stop motion.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:10.400
They will probably stick with paper, but we might consider other methods.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.360
Do you use an animate?

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.720
We try to keep everything as accessible as possible.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.440
We use technology that a lot of people have these days on their iPads or their phones.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.440
There's a couple of apps.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.960
One is called Stop Motion Studio.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.440
I think that's what we use.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.680
That's what we tend to use a lot of the time.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.760
Another one is called Flip a Clip.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.640
Each of them have got their benefits.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:47.840
Flip a Clip is a bit like a flipbook animation style.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.640
You can draw a bit and then you can draw it slightly different on the next page and

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.840
slightly different on the next page.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.880
It works like that.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:01.600
So some of our members have started using Flip a Clip as well.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.960
Sometimes we can combine the two and we can combine photography.

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:13.360
So the characters might move against a background,

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.920
which could be a painting or it could be a photograph.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.520
We all make our own backgrounds as well and our own things.

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:30.560
We don't want to make anyone conform to one particular style

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:37.040
because everybody has their unique creative style ability.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.040
We want it to include everybody.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:47.040
So it doesn't matter if your drawing skills are different from others.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:51.200
We can mash it all together and it produces something wonderful

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.960
that represents everybody who's contributed.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:00.000
You can see, you know they say with the Aardmans stop motion animations,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.120
you can see the fingerprints of the animator in the clay.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:09.920
I think you can see all the personalities and characteristics of everybody in the animation

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.160
club and all the work that we've done.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.840
Nothing is modernized at all.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:14.320
No.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.160
We don't use templates or anything like that.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:16.660
No.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.120
What's the point of that?

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.440
It's like being everybody else and who wants to be like everybody else?

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:31.680
It's great that we use these methods because we get our struts are like a unique kind of

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.880
blend of different styles and different things.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.880
Like I said, mine is the cutie style.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.640
So I probably would, mine is really simple.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:46.800
It's just probably circles and things and stuff like that.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.160
But others are way more better.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.040
But I don't describe them as being better.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.920
It's different, like different styles and tastes, isn't it?

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:04.240
It's like some people, Matty, for example, he's got quite a dark, dry sense of humor.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:04.720
Yeah.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.800
And then there's Jamie.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:13.360
Jamie is quite wacky and sort of a little bit horror inspired at times.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:13.860
Yeah.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.560
I mean, his Joker cut is amazing.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.200
Yeah.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.160
Brilliant character.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.320
And then there's Tom.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.220
Yeah.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.920
Tom's got a real way with words.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:31.920
So he writes a lot of the kind of poetry or sometimes writes scripts and dialogue and things.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.920
It's bringing up the talent of the people that we are.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:42.800
And some people can do digital arts like there's Sol.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.800
Sol's amazing.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.680
He draws everything in.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.760
Do you remember this program called Paint?

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.040
You can get on Microsoft.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:51.540
Oh, yes.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:58.180
Yeah. So he uses that for his animations and they are stunning.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.700
Yeah, they are really stunning.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:00.500
They're professional.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.180
They're really professional.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.420
Like a jimmy painting.

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:05.940
Have you seen that?

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:12.420
It's just the way he makes these lovely smooth curves within Paint.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.940
I just think, wow, that is just like such dedication.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.340
And he's got a whole world of characters of his own.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:21.380
Yeah.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.260
And he's created.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:28.340
Really, that's his personal strength, isn't it?

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:36.900
And that's what we're doing is working with people's personal strength and supporting you all to showcase them.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:37.460
Yeah.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.100
Show them all.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:44.100
So do you think that there is...

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:51.220
So we all tell stories in different ways, but usually they follow a similar...

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:52.420
...structural pattern.

00:20:53.300 --> 00:21:00.100
Do you think that people with learning disability or neurodiverse people have their own particular way of telling a story?

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.140
What do you think is influenced by stories that people...

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:20.740
Well, if we're trying to begin with a new project, we brainstorm of different ideas and stuff and get the opinions of the people that we're working with, don't we?

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:28.180
If we're going into a new project, we brainstorm of ideas, what we can do.

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:32.980
We just go back and forth and see everybody's opinion.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:38.180
And then when we can come to an inclusion, then we go for it.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:42.260
And then we work hard on it for how many months?

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:46.180
Yeah, it's usually over the course of three, four, five months.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:46.920
Yeah.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:47.500
Yeah.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.200
Bit by bit, we get through the work, don't we?

00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.600
We're not doing the animation club at the moment.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.280
We're probably having a little break at the moment, aren't we?

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:10.840
We've had a little break since March, but we're about to begin again in January.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:11.340
Yeah.

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:12.920
We've got just after Christmas.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:13.420
Yeah.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:20.220
But yeah, come back to the question about do people with learning disabilities tell stories differently?

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.060
Yeah, I think we do.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:25.100
I mean, everybody has their own way of telling their story.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:26.240
Yeah.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:31.500
Some try to be extra with their stories.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:38.940
And again, Tom is a perfect example of his storytelling and stuff like that.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:48.940
Yeah, I think the other thing is that what we've noticed within this group is there's so much love and support for each other within the group.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:54.940
And the teamwork is incredible.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:23:02.940
You know, people take on jobs, they decide what they want to do, and then you make sure you get them done.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:03.440
Yeah.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:13.440
And I think that's the really like stellar thing that maybe like the rest of society.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:25.440
It's not really trying. Society is just trying to be taken, trying to get the unique and making them extremely normal.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:31.440
And I say to myself, who wants that? I want to be the extra kind of person.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:39.440
I want to be the bright person that probably shouts out loud, well, not really because I'm a well-mannered kind of person, but you know what I mean.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:53.440
But if everybody in society treats each other as well as the members of the animation club do, in my experience, then I think we do away with a lot of the issues that we have.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.440
Like we'd be closer to each other.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.440
We'd be less isolated.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.440
Yeah.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:08.440
You know, we'd be able to achieve things that, you know, we thought maybe we're outside of our capabilities or what people expect of us.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.440
Yeah.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:14.440
So I kind of think it's like a model to be held up.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.440
I don't think I'm over exaggerating that.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.440
I think it's real.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.440
It's like a really wonderful community.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:27.440
And it's something that I think of all the work that I've done in my life, I feel the most proud of.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.440
And, you know.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:37.440
And a great friendship has been through this between me and Rowan.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:42.440
We are our business partners to the end.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.440
Yeah.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.440
Yeah, we've got that level of commitment to this thing.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:52.440
And Hannah and Jake is also part of our little group.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.440
And I think they say other things.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:04.440
Jake, for example, is a filmmaker and he'd probably talk at length about how unique he finds the storytelling and the style.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.440
And Hannah?

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:12.440
And Hannah has a wonderful visual artist.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.440
Yeah.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:17.440
Who everybody loves Hannah.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.440
Yeah.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.440
So the people mix is really interesting.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.440
Yeah.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.440
In this club.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.440
Yeah.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:34.440
So, yeah, I think for all intents and purposes, I think we have a really good thing going on.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.440
And we'll hope what's in here.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.440
A few more questions.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.440
Okay.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.440
I thought you were trying to wrap it up.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:45.440
We were.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.440
What's the first anime you ever saw?

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:56.440
Oh, if we have specifics, I've really remembered this.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.440
It was in.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.440
Okay.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:06.440
Most typically, probably my first anime is like Yu-Gi-Oh or Pokemon and stuff like that.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:19.440
But I really went into anime in 2007 while I was in Florida because I was obsessed with Disney for a long while.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.440
And I still am.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.440
I like, I love Disney.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:26.440
And don't tell.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.440
You're going to edit this, aren't you?

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.440
But don't tell this.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:35.440
But I stayed up well past one of the nights that I should have.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:49.440
And I stumbled across Toonami's animation block where they were airing some of the anime, animes that was on it, like Full Metal Alchemist.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:55.440
And I think, I think Blood X and stuff like that and stuff like that.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:00.440
And I just saw this and I said, Whoa, what is this?

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.440
And then that's how I discovered anime.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:09.440
And then I realized, Oh, Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh are also animes.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:14.440
So, yes, that's what got me into anime.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:22.440
But and then I slowly developed from there with lots of other things.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:31.440
And I'm a big anime fan now and I'm currently watching some animes at the moment, which are pretty good.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:42.440
So, yeah, that's my taster to anime is usually Pokemon, Beyblade, Yu-Gi-Oh, stuff like that.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.440
You're over-mockery.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:52.440
I think I was, although I studied Japanese at university, I wasn't an otaku type.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:58.440
But I think I was in Japan and I was doing a homestay.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:05.440
And my Japanese sister with a family who I was living with, she was really into Doraemon.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.440
Oh, Doraemon, yeah.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:12.440
Who's this funny blue cat with a white face.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.440
Oh, yeah, Doraemon.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.440
With a helicopter hat.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.440
And they with a Dora-yaki.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.440
You know, like Paddington Bear always has a marmalade sandwich under his hat.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:29.440
So this cat always has like a red bean pancake in its little pouch at the front.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:36.440
I recently ate a Dora-yaki recently and I got a minute.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.440
Oh, actually, no, that was a custard Dora-yaki.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.440
It was a custard one.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.440
Custard one.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:46.440
I haven't touched the red bean paste, but I did taste the custard one.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:58.440
And then the first feature was probably, oh, it was when I was in a student halls and somebody brought a copy of Mononoke Hime, Princess Mononoke.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:02.440
And we watched that and it totally blew my mind.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:10.440
So, yeah, like Ghibli is Ghibli as a, you know, studio.

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.440
It's such, it's got a lot of depth.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:19.440
Like there are a lot of political statements and statements about the environment and the damage that we've done to it and things.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:29.440
And so I think for me in the club, I can't help but bring that kind of thing in as a sort of a nod to Coreda.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.440
Coreda. What's his name?

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.440
Can you edit that bit out, please?

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.440
Different Japanese writer.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.440
Miyazaki.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.440
Yeah, Miyazaki.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.440
Yeah, I like to do Ghibli as well.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:49.440
There are the serious things with Howl's Moving Castle, Princess Mononoke.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:52.440
That was me.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:59.440
Yeah, Diana Wynne-Jones, amazing Welsh writer of fiction for young adults.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.440
Yeah.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.440
Yeah, all older teens.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:20.440
And the thing is, I like Miyazaki more since I heard that he actually came to Wales during the mining strike and he actually cemented in Laputa Castle or Castle of the Sky.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:30.440
There's this mining village that one of the main characters, Pardew, I think his name is.

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:37.440
So I think he was inspired by Welsh socialism and Wales's communities.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:42.440
And you see that in his film, Laputa Castle and the Sky.

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.440
Yeah.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:52.440
So that increased my respect for Haya Miyazaki because he says he loves Wales as well.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:31:00.440
And to bind the two nations that I like the most, Japan and Wales, my birthplace and the country that I admire,

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:12.440
although I do realize that Japan has a few problems of their own that I will not go into really.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:16.440
I wanted to ask you about Comic-Con actually.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:21.440
You mentioned a good welcoming place, your Mavicon.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.440
Yeah.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:27.440
Are the other cons not so welcoming, do you think?

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:41.440
I wouldn't say that because I went to Comic-Con recently at the end of October and I wouldn't say it would have been unpleasant.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.440
It's very welcoming.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:48.440
There's two places in the world that I feel totally normal.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:53.440
One of them is Disneyland and the other is Comic-Con.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:59.440
I think it's about creating a Mavicon in West Wales, in rural Wales.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:04.440
I think the point was the geographical location.

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:10.440
Beth, you obviously have the motivation and the resources to travel.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.440
Yeah.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.440
Not everybody does.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:33.440
So that's why I wanted Comic-Con because not everyone will go to London or Birmingham or these other places where the big ones won't have the time, money or, lack of the words, buses and travel and stuff like that.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:38.440
It's just to make it remote and to people with disabilities who can't go to the...

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:46.440
I'm lucky because I got an auntie in London that I could stay with.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.440
But not everybody has an auntie in London or anything.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:53.440
Not everybody stops their own Comic-Con.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:33:06.440
The other thing about Comic-Con is unlike the other anime festivals, we're not purists in the sense of only screening in with subtitles.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.440
There's that meme, isn't there?

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.440
Like double sub.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:11.440
What would you choose?

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.440
Oh, don't I know it.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:20.440
We screen the anime where there is a dubbed version.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.440
It's dubbed into English.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.440
I think that's important for accessibility for us.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:34.440
Yeah, because we're catering to the general public and probably the general public doesn't want to read the subtitles every single time.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:40.440
And plus, like I said, we have families and probably young children that probably don't want to read.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.440
I need to be willing.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.440
Disability might not be able to read the subtitles.

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:50.440
I'm able to read the subtitles because then again, I watch anime constantly every day.

00:33:50.440 --> 00:34:00.440
But in subbed, I don't care if it's subbed or dubbed kind of thing.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:18.440
So again, but I'm more catered to the people who can't read subbed all the time and young families, especially with young kids and children that probably don't want to read and just want to have a good time.

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:42.440
So if people say that that we're just catering to the mainstream of dubs, I would just tell them, hey, we're catering for little kids and children and families and other people with disabilities who probably don't want to read half the time.

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.440
They just want to have fun.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.440
That's my argument.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.440
Hey, what did you think of Panda phonics?

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.440
Oh, yeah.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:51.440
Panda phonics was amazing.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.440
I'll talk a little bit about that.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:56.440
Now, Panda phonics is this guy.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.440
I don't remember his name.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.440
Theo.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:08.440
And he makes great remixes of an anime and I think animations.

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:09.440
Yeah.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.440
So it's like a VJ.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.440
VJ kind of DJ.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:18.440
He mixes his music with clips from movies and stuff like that.

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:24.440
And he did really well with the last app.

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:29.440
An absolutely amazing job to get a theatre.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.440
Well, in that cinema, I think it's just over 100 seats.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.440
Yeah.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.440
And it was packed out.

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.440
Absolutely sold out.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.440
Yeah.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.440
And everybody is up on their feet dancing and clapping along.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:45.440
It did have like Stiggy Ghibli, Pokemon, anime, stuff like that.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.440
Yeah.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.440
And again, it's like showcasing somebody's talents.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:36:00.440
He's really worked hard to learn how to use the software, to take the visual mixes and the audio mixes and to get these things working together.

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:01.440
Yeah.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.440
Just brilliant.

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.440
Yeah.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.440
I think we can ask visitors to the exhibition.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:13.440
And this is a note for Anna when she added to this to say whether they prefer dubbed or subtitled.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.440
Yeah.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.440
Because I know you actually.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:21.440
Okay.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:27.440
Have there been any depictions of people with a learning disability in any anime films, if you're aware of them?

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:32.440
Oh, well.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:41.440
I know that there's several characters from animation that have had inklings of probably autism.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:45.440
I mean, I think there was this one.

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:59.440
I think Spatula from Raya, the new cartoon of Raya that I'm mixing up my words.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:04.440
Then She-Ra, Masters of the Universe.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.440
Yes.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:12.440
And I think Spatula, who is the mechanic, it's implied that she has autism.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:18.440
I think that she has autism because she has her interests and she's not very good with communicating with people.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:22.440
You know, that's kind of like a stereotype with the autistic person.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:31.440
Does that depiction make you feel good that there's someone with autism on screen or does it make you feel uneasy because, like you said, it's a bit stereotypical?

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:37.440
I'm okay with it if they just broaden the horizon with autistic characters.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:49.440
I mean, there is something called Rayman and stuff like with Dustin Hoffman that depicts as an autistic character.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:38:01.440
I've never seen the movie and what I've heard about it is he's kind of a typical stereotype for an autistic person.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:14.440
But I'm actually, can I say that something else about...

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:26.440
There's this character on Sesame Street that is not animated, but she has been animated in picture books and stuff, and she's fully autistic.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:43.440
And I'm so proud of Sesame Street, too, aware of how autistic people are, even though Julia is on the far end of the spectrum with nonverbal communication and easy.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:50.440
And she gets the...she's not very good with loud noises and she doesn't say hi.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.440
I'm okay with that.

00:38:53.440 --> 00:39:05.440
As an autistic person myself, I broaden the horizon of many anime characters or any person with a disability in animation.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:13.440
So I was just looking up, trying to find the name of this anime that I'd seen a few years ago.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:17.440
But what I remember about it was it was about the Hikikomori.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.440
Oh yeah, Hikikomori.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:25.440
So that's...and now I'm just Googling it, I actually found that there's a whole bunch of anime that feature Hikikomori.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:32.440
So these are people who, for some reason or another, have decided to stay at home, usually young people.

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:41.440
So perhaps through some psychological problems or how society deals with them.

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:47.440
And it's really sad. It's really sad for the Hikikomori.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:56.440
Again, I'm not bashing Japan. I love Japan. I love the culture. I love the food. I love the history of this thing.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.440
But they do have social problems.

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:03.440
Yeah, so these are people who actually feel excluded, I guess.

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:10.440
That's why they've withdrawn or they're not accepted in mainstream Japanese culture.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:19.440
Yeah, even though I praise Japan for their culture and the food and the animation,

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:25.440
there's stuff in Japan that I will agree that is a bit too much.

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:33.440
I'm only going to say this one, but the workforce in Japan is brutal.

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:38.440
I mean, not everyone could be a salary man, the salary person.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:42.440
And they just jam, jam.

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:50.440
Not to say that I fully respect Japan. I'm not attacking Japan. Japan, I love you, Japan.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:57.440
I support you in football and as well as Wales and stuff like that.

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:05.440
I will admit that Japan has their own social problems like any other country has their own social problems.

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.440
Yeah.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:11.440
We'll go bring things to a close there. Thank you very much.

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.440
Thank you.
