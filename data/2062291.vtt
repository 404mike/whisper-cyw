00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760
I started work on the 11th of January 1937.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.840
I wasn't nervous or anything as a matter of fact.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:15.360
Well, maybe the fact that my father was with me made it a little easier, you know.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:27.360
Of course, the only thing I did then for a few months was to shovel coal into a tram.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.440
And then of course the holier would come and take it away.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.320
And my father would prepare the coal and I'd fill it.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.960
But eventually, of course, I became able to get the coal myself.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.880
I remember the first pay that my father had after I was working with him as a boy.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.440
Well, I didn't have a pocket, it was all in one pocket.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.040
So I had to depend on him.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.200
And the only thing I had was half a gram of pocket money.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.760
And the first thing I remember him us doing, and him giving me nine pence

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.400
to over to the check-wear, he was called.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.360
He was a secular lodge up there then and he was a check-wear.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.600
Give me nine pence, six pence for his federation money and three pence for mine.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.880
Oh, so I paid federation, I still pay it anyway.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.240
That's when I started growing up.
