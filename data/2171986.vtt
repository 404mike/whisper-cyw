00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800
An accident. It was early evening and we were back at the village house that had been kindly

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.680
loaned to us by the architect. I'd taken something upstairs, washing I think, to rinse

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:19.320
on the terrace and hang out. Coming back down the stone staircase, I guessed with bare feet,

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.600
I found myself losing my footing. I arrived at the foot of the stairs on my back. The

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.480
next thing I heard was, can you hear me? And being shaken. Opening my eyes is like a scene

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.280
from a comic. As I moved my head around I was seeing stars and my right leg and bum

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.160
hurt like hell. I'd been unconscious for no more than 20 or 30 seconds but this seemed

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.920
like a lifetime to Stephanie who was now reluctant to try and haul me to my feet or at least

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.800
to my knees. With instructions not to move she ran round the corner to her neighbour's

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.680
house. I wasn't sure I could. She soon arrived back with Matt, her neighbour and his mum

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.480
and I was slowly raised to a seating position but I was still seeing stars. Cautiously I

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.560
answered questions. Did I feel sick? Could I focus my eyes? Could I rotate my head? Move

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.320
my leg? Wiggle my toes? All seemed well but a large bump was rising on my head and the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.040
stars at last went away. Nothing seemed to be broken and the offer of a trip to hospital

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.960
in the port was declined. An early night, a long sleep and a review of the position

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.320
next morning was the plan. After a restless night that was mostly caused by my aching

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.480
leg we decided a hospital visit would be a sensible precaution. My leg was more painful

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.560
than my head with the bump having shrunk away. I hobbled into the general hospital reception

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.840
where we were directed to a general waiting area. After a short time we realised there

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.520
was an appointment system in operation and fearing we could be there for several hours

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.800
waiting our turn I suggested ringing Manos for advice. We adjourned to a cafe opposite

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.600
and made the call. His concern was immediate. Drive Jeff over here straight away I will

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.320
call my doctor and get him to see you as soon as possible. It sounded a good offer and within

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:22.200
the hour after a nice frappe at the office we were in the doctor's waiting room. After

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.200
a short wait we were called in. Hello I'm George and Manos has told me about the incident.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.000
Where is the pain at the moment? Dr George carried out a thorough series of tests and

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.200
conducted a detailed cross examination with questions about the fall as well as my general

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.400
health. He even put out his cigarette in the ashtray on his desk and resisted lighting

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.240
another. Eventually we both sat down and he offered his advice. There appeared not to

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.200
be any serious repercussions from the fall. His tests had not revealed any signs of neurological

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.720
effects. He outlined the sort of things I should watch for including nausea, balance

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.720
problems, eyesight changes etc. He recommended visiting my doctor back in England in a week's

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.480
time. Reassured I asked if there were any changes I should make. He suggested I should

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.760
avoid strenuous exercise, I do anyway, and should avoid excessive drinking but as I was

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.760
on holiday and it was hot social drinking was okay. By this he elaborated he meant a

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.920
glass or two of wine with my evening meal should be okay. As an after thought he added

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.440
that social smoking should be okay as well as the flight home next week. If I had any

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.960
concerns I should call him again. We returned back to the office feeling relieved and relayed

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.080
the information to Manos. We laughed about the social drinking and smoking and Manos

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.560
immediately offered me one of his high strength cigarettes. I readily refused. As an alternative

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.840
he suggested lunch. His treat had to have guilt about the stairs despite me reassuring

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.160
him it was only my own fault that the fall had taken place. A welcome long lunch was

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.440
taken under trees at the restaurant near the office and apparently owned by the mother

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.480
of our electrician. Manos was now also feeling delicate and arriving at the restaurant announced

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:23.120
to the owner in a stage whisper I have diarrhoea what do you recommend. I'm certain that in

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.320
England the same request would have been met with something like I recommend you eat somewhere

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.080
else. Thankfully we were the first customers and the owner brought a plate of two fried

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.400
eggs for Manos before serving large helpings of mixed mesedas to the three of us. I drank

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.480
a soft drink resisting the recommended social drinking while Manos fortified by the eggs

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.480
ate at least half the mesedas and drank a couple of cold beers. We chatted for an hour

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.080
or two until I said I felt I needed a rest so we returned to the house. Manos I hope

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.000
went back to the office to lie down as well. Sunday morning was spent agreeing the outstanding

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.320
list of works to be completed with Manos. The main items that were obstructing this

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:12.440
was the hatch and the metal hatch covers on the ground floor. Manos is also in creative

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.600
mood this morning. What about a folding bed attached to the metalwork? It would give you

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.880
much more flexibility upstairs. I know somewhere in town that can have strong mattresses made

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.200
up to any size. It's not expensive I would give you directions. In the bathroom he proposed

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.760
using the metal upright as a spine for some small shelving that would make you for useful

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:41.760
storage. Up on the roof we discussed the necessity for shade. We brought a large white triangular

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.320
canvas cell from England. We asked if anything could be done with this. We stretched it out.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.880
It would need some uprights to suspend it from. Leave it with me I'll see what can be done.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.000
The problems with the hatches, the roof one and the ground floor hatches, had kept downstairs

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.360
as a building site. In this state, even though we'd taken measurements, there had been limited

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.960
opportunity to make decisions about any permanent arrangements for the kitchen and seating which

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.920
we knew we needed. The hope had been that we would camp in the house and give ourselves

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:21.120
an idea of how much or how little space there was and how we should split it up. As a compromise

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.360
we suggested to Manos that if his carpenter could make us a simple bench work surface

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.680
housing a sink, the taps could be fitted to the wall. Then we could use it as a temporary

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.440
kitchen until we felt we understood the space in the house for us to make some decisions

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:42.720
on more permanent arrangements. This was readily agreed to, even suggested some storage below

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:49.280
the work surface. We agreed to meet again before we left midweek and we adjourned to

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.280
a new restaurant that was quickly becoming our favourite. We took a long lunch again

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:59.320
on the first floor terrace in the restaurant, created inside an old carob factory. The

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.680
rub seemed to be a wonder crop, used as a chocolate substitute, as cattle fodder and

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:10.760
as some mysterious ingredient in the photographic film production. The building has been beautifully

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.960
restored with carefully selected fittings set against stone walls, lots of glass and

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:21.120
pastel coloured furniture. I noticed that there were no pictures hung on the walls and

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.040
cheekily asked the owner if they would be interested in some framed prints, the product

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.760
of a recent spell at a print department in our local college at home. The answer was

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.960
typically cretin, why not, bring them in with you next time and we'll look at them. The

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.840
following day we returned and ordered some wine. I showed the pictures to the owner who

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.960
was complimentary but said he thought he would leave the walls clear for the time being.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.120
He must have sensed my disappointment as he quickly asked me to bring the pictures with

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:55.360
me. We're going next door where we have a shop. We left the restaurant and just next

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.760
door down a couple of steps was a small shop and as my eyes adapted to the contrast between

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:06.600
the bright sun outside and the comparatively subdued lighting within, I saw a smiling dark

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:12.520
haired lady sitting behind a carved polished wood desk. This is my mother. We exchanged

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:17.920
handshakes. Jeff has some pictures for us to sell. Where shall we put them? The shop

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:23.360
comprised two smallish rooms with stone walls and a cool tiled floor with sets of shelves

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:29.440
and small tables on every wall. The stock was a mixture of beautifully coloured glass,

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.920
racks of wine and local rackie, carved olive wood ornaments and kitchenware as well as

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:40.400
pretty coloured metal jugs used in restaurants or house wine. So near the start of the season

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.760
it seemed very well stocked with little space for all five framed prints, each one some

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:51.680
two foot by 18 inches. Dimitri was undeterred and started handing items off the shelves

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:57.520
to me. Once my arms were full I had to start putting stuff down on some of the other shelves.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.600
After several reshuffles and reducing some of the space in between items we were left

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:07.160
with a bare shelf, lit with spotlumps in a prime position facing the door. We'll put

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:12.960
them here he said decisively. I hoped his mother approved, after all it was her shop.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.560
I needn't have worried as she was smiling serenely and turned to attend to a customer

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:22.440
who was making what appeared to be an impulse purchase of a large coloured glass piece for

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:28.560
the princy sum of 300 euros. Perhaps bringing the princy would be a good move, then I remembered

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.040
we had yet to discuss any commercial arrangements.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.920
Are you happy with the pictures here Jeff? Yes they look good, let's hope they will

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:41.400
sell I answered. What are your normal arrangements for pricing with suppliers? We quickly agreed

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:47.520
on a simple arrangement, a 50-50 profit split and a euros retail price per frame print

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.760
with Dimitri at my suggestion having the option of discounting the price later in the season

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:58.960
if they were unsold. As I folded up the large zip bag I brought them in and my pack of greeting

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:04.680
cards with local photos fell out. What are these? You do cards too? Yes, would you like

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:11.240
some of these as well? Why not? he said positively. Let's go, your wine will be getting warm.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:15.600
I returned to the restaurant terrace where my wife was enjoying the sun, the view and

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:21.200
the wine. You'd be gone ages, will they take any? Smiling I was able to report that

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.400
all five were on display in the shop next door together with the cards. On the strength

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:33.960
of future revenue we ordered lunch and another carafe of wine, well why not? At home. We

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:39.120
were away staying with friends in Wales towards the end of June when the next update arrived,

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:44.000
just a photo of the spiral staircase and the hatch with the caption, Glass for the hatch

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.880
has been located. This is good news as there will be much discussion about whether it will

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:55.680
be one panel of glass or nine, plate glass or glass bricks or even in a fit of frustration

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.760
wood. Dear Geoff, I hope you had a pleasant weekend. The Glass for the hatch has been

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:06.540
located. This week the Ironman, Glassman, Electrician and me all go together to see

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:11.580
how it's working and what is needed. I thought that would be a site meeting I would be happy

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:17.740
to miss. Earlier in the process we've detected some fairly undisguised tensions between Manos

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:22.740
and the Metalman and there have been some uncomplimentary comments about the Glassman.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:28.260
At one point Manos had told me that the Tileman thought they were all making too much fuss.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:33.720
Frustrated by the delay I suggested, only half in jest, that the Tileman should be immediately

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:39.960
commissioned to install a hatch of his own design, tiled or otherwise. I left my call

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.920
to Manos until the end of the week and on the Friday morning had one of our usual styles

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:50.640
of conversations. It could not be described as being at total cross purposes nor it could

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:55.840
be thought of as entirely in tune. I opened the skirmish by asking whether the hatch meeting

00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:01.720
had concluded satisfactorily. He gave a guarded yes. I then asked him whether it had leaked

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:06.640
at all and asked if he was satisfied with the seal. Ah yes, it was fine for the hose

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:12.920
pipe but here the winter rains would be unlike rain you've ever seen. Okay, so we just hope

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:18.240
it will be okay then. But as far as it goes the house is now sealed and weather tight.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:23.520
He then changed tack. So tell me when are you coming back again? Well as we said, when

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.900
the house is finished and we can stay in it, let us know when that will be and then I can

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:33.020
book flights. His reply was that we should tell him when we would be coming and the house

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:38.500
would be finished by that date. I gave up and said we would talk about it here and contact

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:45.020
him shortly, probably the next day. The next day after booking flights for the end of July

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:50.300
we called the office and relayed the dates, also agreeing a few details to be finished.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:55.500
Unfortunately this visit did not take place following a dramatic turn of events. Since

00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:01.660
the last visit in June I had suffered from painful headaches. Visits to our doctor and

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:08.340
two subsequent trips to two casualty wards had only resulted in suggestions of migraines.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:13.100
After a rapid deterioration and a very frightening 24 hours of the kind support of our friends

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:19.340
Dallara Martin, I was to wake up in an intensive care unit in a neurological centre of the

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:25.240
Sussex hospital. A surgical team had been called in and I had undergone an emergency

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:32.240
and life savouring operation. Delayed completion of the holiday home seemed an incidental matter.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:37.640
Once the haematoma was drained and following several days monitoring and a second brain

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:44.320
scan I was released home for recuperation with stern instructions to take it very easy,

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:50.340
no driving or flying for the immediate future. It appeared that the split second slip back

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:56.660
in June had resulted in a very close call. After my dramatic hospital visit the need

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:01.720
to recuperate pushed the thoughts of the house project from my mind but there was a need

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:08.720
to tell Monos that the planned visit in August would not be taking place.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.920
The latest emails had been some questions of detail that I had picked up while in hospital

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.920
so these were briefly answered with an accompanying promise to call him in a few days without

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:24.680
revealing the reason for this. I had been told to avoid any further drama and excitement

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:29.480
and we concluded that conversations about the house, particularly with Monos, usually

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:35.600
involved a measure of both of these. An update arrived via the photo website with some welcome

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.040
progress. The floor tiles on the ground floor had been relayed which must mean the floor

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:45.240
hatches had been reinstalled, new stone inserts had been cut and fitted to the side of the

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:51.280
stair treads and we could see that the air conditioning unit had been installed, placed

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:56.840
neatly high up in the stairwell next to the spiral stairs. Stephanie rang the office and

00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:01.440
broke the news to Helen and asked her when would be a good time to speak to Monos, knowing

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:06.680
he would be upset. An hour later, breathless and very concerned, Monos was ringing us.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:12.480
It is dreadful, how is Geoff? Will he be alright? I am so upset. Eventually she asked if he

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:19.360
would like to talk to me. A plaintiff Monos weakly inquired, can he speak? We talked and

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:24.080
I reassured him that the surgeon said there was no reason I should not make a full recovery

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:29.440
as long as I took a period of taking things easy. In practical terms this meant postponing

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:34.200
our planned visit for the following week. The house is almost ready, I will send you

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:39.720
photos but are you sure that you will be okay? It is so tragic. We broke the news of our

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:44.080
abandoned trip to move into the house but emphasised that we would travel as soon as

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:49.600
I received the all clear to. Conversation moved on to details of completed works and

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:55.880
outstanding tasks. I felt an information overload and perceptively Monos must have sensed this

00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:00.120
as he said that it would be best to look at the photos and call with any questions or

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:06.840
instructions. Exchanging best wishes we ended the call. He was as good as his word and later

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:11.160
the same day some more photos arrived showing that the fridge had been installed. There

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:16.760
was also photos of a new doorbell, an outside light above the front door and down lighters

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:22.480
in one of the warm niches. Early evening I called Monos again to thank him for the photos

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:27.440
and check he was over the shock of my news. He sounded more composed but also promised

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:33.400
to take some more photos that evening to show the lights on in the house. Again he wished

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.360
me a speedy recovery and we look forward to receiving this further update even though

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:43.720
there was a growing sense of frustration at not being able to stay in the completed house.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:48.000
When we were able to look at the photos the next day we were truly delighted by them.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.280
The outside lights washed down the stones at the front of the house highlighting the

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:57.600
contours and bringing out the honey coloured tones of the stones. The lights inside shone

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.880
out through the open windows with the grey painted shutters and frames contrasting with

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:07.440
the colour of the stones. The photos of the interior were equally rewarding. The same

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:12.600
coloured stones with the wide light pointing between them looked wonderful with the warm

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:18.080
browns and yellows relieved by some light greys. We'd chosen some coloured light shades

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:23.600
to use as four pendant lights to hang from the old wooden beams upstairs. These contrasted

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:28.320
nicely with the sharper light of the down lighters and niche lights but their harshness

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:33.840
was already tempered by the variety of colours in the stone and the walls. Manos has also

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:39.600
prepared a small surprise for us by way of a ribbon of LED lights forming an L shape

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:44.920
along the two walls. We'd agreed with Manos to leave a gap between the walls and the floorboards

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:50.480
on the first floor. He'd eloquently described the floor as floating with the light washing

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:56.200
up and down the stone walls through a small gap. The LED lights magnify this effect and

00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:01.800
look very dramatic in the photos. There was also a practical aspect to the floating floor

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:07.720
meaning that the edge could be straight even though the wall surface around it was uneven.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:12.400
Another photo showed some expensive looking black box with a blue light on it. It also

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:18.880
stated uninterruptible power supply for the electric hatch mechanism. Very high tech but

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.960
perhaps essential if we didn't want to get stranded on the roof terrace. There was also

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.960
pictures of the stairs with the light from the bathrooms shining through the frosted

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:34.920
glass stair backs illuminating the stairs very theatrically. The whole look was now closer to

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:40.600
our imagination. A blend of traditional and modern with interesting little design surprises.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:46.120
The final addition was the kitchen unit that the carpenter had made. There'd be much discussion

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:51.240
about the kitchen throughout the project but as the building details were finalised and we began

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:57.720
to see more Cretan houses and think about Cretan recipes the options widened rather than narrowed.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.600
We concluded that we wanted to live in the house before finalising the kitchen

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.120
so to ask Manos if a simple temporary kitchen bench could be made.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:13.240
This had a simple sink inset, space for a free-standing hob and food preparation. The

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:18.040
taps could be fixed to the wall and some storage made on a shelf below the work surface.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:23.080
The phone rang early at home one morning. Good morning, is it too early? I'm up at your house

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:28.200
and I'm wondering about the plant from outside. What do you think? A bougainvillea, a vine or a

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:34.200
jasmine? Well it must be nearly finished if he's thinking about planting shrubs. After a brief

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:39.640
discussion we settled on a jasmine. It would be more fragrant than a vine and less prickly on the

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:45.160
stem than a bougainvillea. Once more we expressed our gratitude and said how pleased we'd been with

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:49.880
the whole look of the house in the recent night pictures that we'd seen. He agreed that the

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:55.400
lighting seemed to have enlarged the building both inside and out and after he'd gone we realised that

00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:01.400
today was the day we would have flown out again but had to be cancelled because of my operation.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:07.880
No matter, the house would still be there for later visits. The next contact from Manos was an

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:14.120
online conversation one evening early in August. After asking about my post-op recovery plan,

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:19.800
he told us that jasmine had been planted and was some two metres tall. We exchanged other text

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:24.760
comments and then it became quite lyrical. I've just finished a large project but it's not been

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:32.040
as creative as your house. Your house is small but enlarged, unique and intelligent. I have enjoyed

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:37.240
the project and working with you. This is good to hear because the three of us knew that the whole

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:42.760
project had not been without its frustrations for all of us but if we got to this point in all fairness

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:47.160
and we got to this point and all felt so positive at the end of it then it would be a good thing.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:53.080
He concluded by saying he would send a photo of the climbing jasmine and pictures of the inside

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:59.080
after cleaning and we would wish each other a good weekend. As promised a new set of pictures

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:04.760
arrived with the first one showing the jasmine planted to the left of the front door and climbing

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:10.200
three quarters of the way to the top of the door. Other photos were of the staircase after they'd

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:15.880
been cleaned as well as the new floorboards upstairs. There are also more images of the

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:21.160
detail in the wet room with its shock tiling which was still taking a little getting used to.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:27.480
The glass in the windows and the floor pan looked clean as did the large mirror entirely covering

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:32.920
the back of the bathroom door. Areas of tiling that needed finishing when we were last there

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:38.600
in the early summer were now finished. We noticed details such as door handles and window

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:44.520
shutter latches. This has really felt like finishing touches and I couldn't wait to

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:49.960
get out there to see it all and at long last stay in the house.
