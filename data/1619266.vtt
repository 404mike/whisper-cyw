00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500
is that the main teacher in the Hebrew class was Reverend Gray.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.900
He's probably come up in your talks.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.500
And he, in fact, taught my uncle.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.100
He went to Cheder in the 1920s.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.500
So Reverend Gray was there from a young man.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.100
But the interesting thing with Reverend Gray, I've again discovered,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.000
is that he was a pupil in Israel, or in Palestine in those days.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.000
A man called Rabbi Cook was the chief rabbi of Palestine.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.200
But also, again, he was a very remarkable man.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.400
He's again in Jewish history.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.200
Rav Cook is, you know, the tops.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.300
And the thing about him is, obviously, he was a very, very religious fellow.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.600
But he realized that not all Jews were religious.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.400
And he encouraged secular Jews to come to Palestine to live.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.900
And he made them welcome.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.600
He was an all-inclusive, very, you know, ultra-religious man, but all-inclusive.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.000
He realized that secular Jews were Jews, not just, you know, they weren't heathens.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.400
So, and Reverend Gray was very much like that.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.000
And I remember on one occasion, my uncle was dying.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.700
Now, my uncle, who was my mother's brother, he married a non-Jewish lady.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.600
But his mother was such a matriarch that they were scared to tell her.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.500
And she never knew that he'd married a non-Jewish lady.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.300
She never, ever was told.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.800
He was always, as far as she's concerned,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.400
Abby is going to get married one day.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.800
But she never knew.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.800
So anyway, what happened is, when my uncle was dying in hospital,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.500
I went to see him, and Reverend Gray was with him.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.700
And when I met Reverend Gray in the synagogue on a Saturday,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.300
I said, oh, thank you very much for going to see my uncle,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.800
thinking that he would never go and see him because he'd married a non-Jew.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.000
And he said, why shouldn't I go and see him?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.600
They are all my children.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.900
So he was a good guy.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.900
You've probably heard a lot about Reverend Gray.
