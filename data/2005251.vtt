00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.440
Hello there, my name is Graham Verbeer, a member of Newport based hip hop comedy group

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.560
Goldie Looking Chain.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:24.440
I have been a DJ around Newport for years and I do some shifts in Diverse with my friends

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.440
Paul and Matt.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.880
Gigs, gigs, how long have I been going to gigs?

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.640
I think my first ever gig was The Levelers at Newport Centre with Credit to the Nation

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.640
and Chumbawumba.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.480
Right, and I was about 14.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.440
I wasn't allowed to go to see therapy in TJs because my mum was scared of TJs at that point

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.840
because I was quite young, so I was only about 13.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.200
So I think it was a trade off, I couldn't go and see therapy, they had just done an

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.800
album called Pleasure Death which also terrified my mother.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.520
So she said, you can go see The Levelers, they look like nice chaps.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.000
And I went to see The Levelers and the Credits to the Nation were amazing.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.560
But yeah, that was my first gig in the Newport Centre.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.920
Oh, but it's not really actually, come on, that's the first gig I go to on my own.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.800
Can I just also say though, I did go to a lot of gigs with my parents in the Newport

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.600
Centre including Tim Machine with lead singer David Bowie, my hero.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.040
So I have seen David Bowie in the Newport Centre.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.200
That was amazing.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.720
But my parents thought he was going to do Space Oddity and Rebel Rebel and he didn't,

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.800
he did a lot of thrash metal sort of stuff and they hated it and they said they were

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.480
never taking me to another gig again.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.200
Hence, the next gig I went to was The Levelers on my own with my friends.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.640
So most memorable gig, I'm going to have to be a bit narcissistic and include a gig I

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.140
did because it was a great day and it would be the TJs in the Square, which was in John

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.140
Frost Square.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:00.480
It was in tribute to John Sokolo who ran and TJs and owned TJs for many years and we've

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.880
all done our time in TJs as indie boys, you know, and indie girls.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.720
We all had a great time in TJs back in the 90s, 80s, 90s.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.340
It was a great place to go.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.640
So it was a great day of Newport bands and we were headlining but I managed to sort of

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.000
hang out with all the bands I used to follow around Newport, you know, and my favourite

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.080
were Nova Kane.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.000
I sort of hung out with Steve, the singer, and I was a bit fanboy-y and he was all chuffed.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.040
He was like, oh my God, you guys are great.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.040
I love you guys.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.480
And I'm like, no, no, no, you are great.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.920
Because I used to go and see, I saw Elastica, I saw all sorts of gigs where Nova Kane would

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.320
be usually third on the bill, 60 foot dolls then and then the band who were coming into

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.320
Newport.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.200
But I'd always go to see Nova Kane.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.400
I'd follow Nova Kane around and they were my favourite.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.640
But it was cool just to play with them, see them get back on stage.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.000
That was 2010, 2010.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
There was all sorts.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.160
Disco, my pal Ed, Casey in Disco and Sam from La Pub.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.280
They reformed for a day.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.840
We had John Robb down here from the Membranes.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.800
John Robb and he was big mates with John, Ticolo and Goldblade, yeah.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.320
Which I'm not sure what they played as that day.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.400
It might have been Goldblade.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.280
But yeah, but he's in the Membranes as well.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.720
I'm not sure what Darling Buds were on.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.880
They had some good hits with our mates in that as well, Matt and all.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.200
And who else was on that day?

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.440
It was a great day of all sorts.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.280
I'm trying to think, who else?

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.160
Us.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.680
It was a great day and everyone was sort of jumping around John Frost Square.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.920
By the time we got on, it was quite late and everyone jumping up and down John Frost Square.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.440
And I just thought, why have we not done this before?

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.480
And then John Frost Square didn't exist anymore and you couldn't really do it

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.080
because it didn't have that sort of space.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.240
But it looked, from the stage, it looked amazing.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.480
Us being Newport Boys, we just played all sorts of festivals and things.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.920
But that, to me, was just wonderful.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.800
Seeing all my people jumping up and down in the middle of John Frost Square.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.480
Yeah, because I used to DJ on a night called Drop Your Pants.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.920
And it was a big indie night, wasn't it?

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.040
For years before I started doing it as well with John and Malc and all.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.960
It was a massive night.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.760
So all these generations that went through that night, or you go to TJs,

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.840
it'd be the same sort of crowd and bits and pieces.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.440
And then you'd have maybe a rock, a harder rock crowd in TJs some nights.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.920
And of course, there was the pop crowd who would just go out

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.320
and go to the pubs and the Meringer crowd.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.720
And all of those type of people from all those different years did turn up for that.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.440
Yeah, because, you know, it basically, of course,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.600
TJs did have a bit of maybe sort of other type of nights, didn't they?

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.360
It wasn't just rock.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.920
It's just a fascinating place to be, TJs, back in the 80s, 90s.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.000
People tell me that the 80s were better.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.200
I miss them.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.000
But, you know, TJs was great, didn't they, 90s?

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.760
Yeah, but it was just nice to see all sorts of people turn out

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.640
from all the different ages and then just come together for John and TJs,

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.600
but also for Newport Music.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.000
And we've always had that.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.920
We were the New Seattle, you know, remember that?

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.840
But we were the New Seattle and, you know, we had great bands

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.360
like Dean and the Cowboy Killers,

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.200
Tea Rooms of Babylon, remember them?

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.120
They were a good band.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.160
And as they say, Novocaine and Flyscreen, Rollercoaster.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.280
Rollercoaster.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.840
That was Sticky's band, wasn't it?

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.800
That was Sticky's band.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.120
Loads of great bands.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.520
60 Foot Dolls, obviously, as well.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.760
All these people were in TJs and suddenly they were in bands,

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.120
you know, where you would go to the Meringer, the Mannix would be in there.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.920
And, you know, and they'd be all bands everywhere.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.600
And it was a it was a it was great.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.280
Everyone was in a band and forming like sort of arts, you know,

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.920
not necessarily bands that had an eye on the charts,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.840
but I just wanted to do some music.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.440
It was a creative place.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.040
It's always has been.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.680
So that's that's what TJs was great for.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.080
And that's what that was a celebration of TJs in the Square.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.000
Wonderful. Bring them back.
