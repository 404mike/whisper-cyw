00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.640
Ancient, take me back to the ancestors.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:22.640
My heart and soul.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:38.080
Alive everywhere for a change.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:44.080
Suspended, gazing out over a blue ocean.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.080
I don't know what I'm standing on.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.080
Must be the ocean.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:01:00.240
The present drinks my pastель.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:14.640
Meted in the last, most despicable hour.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:29.320
Like a magical connection.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.320
Timeless.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:41.200
Like a magical connection.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.200
Timeless.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:51.200
Like a magical connection.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:06.200
Like a magical connection.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.200
Like a magical connection.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:22.200
The magic of spring has appeared again.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.200
Let's be free and listen to the heartbeat of Mother Earth.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.200
I'm so honored to be here, to be able to create, together with other Celtic women.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.200
Let's be free and listen to the heartbeat of Mother Earth.
