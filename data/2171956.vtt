WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560
Returning. A daytime flight returned us to the island. The temperature rose some 10 degrees

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.360
from the Sussex we'd left behind and was in the pleasant high 20s. After collecting

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.800
the hire car at the airport we drove east on the new National Road, commenting on the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.840
flowering shrubs lining the road and the very green looking olive groves. In the distance

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.700
there was still a little snow on the mountain tops but roadside vendors were selling large

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:35.900
bags of potatoes and bunches of small bananas. Time away allowed one to forget what a country

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.100
of contrasts Crete was. Within an hour we were parking in the hill village where we

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.460
borrowed the completed house from the architect, none packing more luggage than normal because

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.460
of our camping ambition. We were met by the estate agent delivering cleaning for us. After

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.900
exchanging greetings and news we arranged to go to the office to catch up with Manos.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.200
He was seeing another client but said he would meet us in 20 minutes time at the restaurant

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.300
up the road. It was one of our favourites with views over the marina and the bay from

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.140
an airy terrace sheltered under a canopy and screened by trees. We caught up with family

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.460
news with the owners who were combining catering and social duties with after school childcare

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.780
for their energetic children. Manos arrived in good spirits and joined us for something

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.860
to eat and drink. He said the project's work was still busy for the business but

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.300
the estate agency had quietened down over the winter. He then presented us with a key

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.180
to the house. It was fixed with a glossy red key holder with a little white light. It was

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.300
good to see him again and we couldn't wait to see the progress on the house. Before setting

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.880
off to the village and our house we collected the bags of clothes that had been in the architectural

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.840
store room through the winter. Theoretically this was arranged so that we travelled lighter

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.120
but we seemed to be accumulating larger and larger wardrobes in Crete. Half an hour later

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.120
we were walking through the village down to our house with eager anticipation to see first

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.600
hand the work we'd been following so keenly on the internet through the winter and the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.480
earlier part of the year. We were not disappointed. The newly cleaned stone walls were beautiful

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.000
and the grey painted shutters and door blended well with the old stones. After opening the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.240
front door with the flash new door key we saw the tiled floor and the new wall and the

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.960
door to create the bathroom. We opened the shutters on the new window downstairs to let

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.920
more light in. It was hard to work out what features we'd seen before and which ones

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.280
we'd committed to memory from the photos Manos had been posting. We were shown around

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:54.940
the tiling. We'd seen the pictures and had made a request for a gaudy-esque effect but

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.560
in real life any doubts we had soon went away. Yes they were striking, which was exactly

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.620
the phrase I'd first used to him. After seeing the photos at the time he'd said,

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.800
Ah you don't like the tiling. Once again we assured him and realised that three of

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.440
to stand in the bathroom that we were all worried about the size. It can't be too small,

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.600
we are all in it, though as Manos pointed out the WC in the sink hadn't been installed

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.960
yet. The architect's creativity was still in full flight. I have been thinking that

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.160
there is a small space at the side of the stairs that would lend themselves to a frosted

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.440
glass panel that would let some light into the bathroom void area. It would create a

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.000
small light well with light from the glass roof hatch. What do you think? We liked the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.320
idea and readily agreed. There were also some glass plates to put on the backs of some of

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.080
the stairs for the same reason. We felt confident this would be an interesting bathroom but

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.560
the main question was when will it be functional? Going through the rest of the house there

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.960
was a lot of new work to examine. We got used to this process following a familiar pattern

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.880
with Manos both on site and over the phone. We would say how delighted we were with some

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.040
new addition or piece of building work and he would modestly say it was simple or that

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.400
the work could have been improved with more room or better craftsmen or by manufacturing

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.760
Athens or Italy. Any hesitation on our part was met defensively. You don't like it, we

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.920
must change it, it is your house, what colour, size, pattern etc etc. We looked at the show

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.480
Chinese used fuse box so different from the jumble of boxes at home under the stairs in

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:48.280
Sussex. It's uniform lines and neat little fuses, some red or green little lights twinkling

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.920
behind the neat perspex door fitted into a small niche just outside the house. You don't

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.880
like it, you would prefer a grey door to match the woodwork, I'll get it changed. We both

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:06.760
were tested, it's fine, really, you should see our fuse is back home, antiquated. You

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.240
want the box to be hidden, the carpenter could make a small wooden cupboard to disguise it,

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.600
would you prefer that? No, no, it's lovely, really, we love it, really modern and functional.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.560
Does it work? Ah, the electrician will connect it all tomorrow, the lighting is not on yet,

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:31.760
it's working darkly, don't touch any loose wires. Downstairs was a little congested with

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.280
the three of us in an already small space that doubled as a resting place with builders'

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:44.200
tools, tile cutters, toolbox, unused wiring materials, tiles and plumbing materials as

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.280
well as some of the old shutters and some new metal plates as well as a rubbish dump

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:56.200
for packing and discarding materials. I was very careful not to touch any loose wires.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.960
Because of his evidence of activity, which we were anxious not to inhibit, it was difficult

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.240
to see the new tiles on the ground floor. We liked what we could see, large book-sized

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:13.240
light-coloured stone plates, slightly irregular with a textured surface. The floor was also

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:19.460
punctuated with some large holes, some with metal plates over, partially tiled, some more

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:25.720
alarmingly open. Another next to the new staircase looked dark and deep. That's to the septic

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:32.880
tank, it's deep, said Manos, let's go upstairs. We needed no second bidding but already knew

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.560
from the view downstairs through the steel framework to the ceiling upstairs that the

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.720
first floor was somewhat conceptual at this stage. In fact, upstairs was more dangerous

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.040
than the ground floor. The staircase looked good with stone treads over the metal framework,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.080
it also felt solid, but progress ended quickly as we all three gathered at the top of the

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:59.320
stairs looking across the first floor room. The metalwork frame was still without floorboards

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:05.760
and as a result needed circus skills to negotiate it in full. I restricted myself to walking

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:11.280
across a scaffolding plank to the sparrows staircase leading up to the roof terrace.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.760
Manos quickly followed, don't go on the terrace, another coat of insulation was placed there

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:22.480
this morning and you shouldn't walk on it yet. Sure enough the terrace has now a glossy

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:28.800
grey coat looking like a bumper layer of putty. Empty it was possible to imagine a table and

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:35.080
a seating for six of us dining under the stars one day. Back in the real world Manos showed

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:40.680
me where the terrace walling had been raised and all repointed in white mortar. Reluctantly

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.480
he waved at the opening to the terrace where we were standing at the top of the spiral

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:50.440
stairs. This has been a nightmare he groaned. The metal man has not seen eye to eye with

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:56.120
me. It is essential that he is made weather tight. Much into himself it was clear that

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.360
this was not a suitable discussion for our first meeting. So I changed the subject and

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:06.880
admired the new narrow long set of windows onto the terrace designed to bring light in

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.560
and across the first floor ceiling. For a change he agreed. Yes these have worked out

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:21.720
well and allowed some nice diffused light. Unqualified approval. Unusual. Manos described

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:26.760
the remaining works and his plans. A couple of additions were talked over. The building

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:32.860
permit included a small balcony on the first floor outside the pair of small glass doors.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.500
We had removed it from the first building phase on cost grounds but Manos suggested

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:42.540
completing it while the carpenter was still working at the house. We gave a quick agreement

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:47.260
as we felt it with further opening up the first floor room and allow a sea view without

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:52.820
climbing up to the roof terrace. We were also beginning to think about furniture or at least

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:58.780
storage and fittings. It was agreed that the new cavity created outside the bathroom wall

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:03.980
would house the fridge freezer but there was extra room that could be a store cupboard.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:08.020
The other thing we noticed was the drop down of stairwell from where the first floor would

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:15.180
be. We began to think that some screen or storage unit might be a practical safety feature.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:20.780
Talking about this was delayed until after the floor was installed. Of the planning works

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.360
the electrician would be coming the next day to finish the fuse panel. The plumber would

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.840
connect the bathroom fittings once we had chosen these. This could be done the next

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.560
day. The carpenter would put in the first floor as soon as the messy work for the terrace

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:40.560
coating and the roof hatch was complete. It was still all being held up by the hatch.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:46.040
Additionally, there was all the cleaning, repainting and minor finishing jobs, in some

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:52.080
cases repairing the damage done in the course of completion. This was probably the inevitable

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:58.080
penalty of a cramped workspace. Looking around at everything to be done and the multiple

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:03.840
work in progress areas in the house, camping seemed optimistic but hey this was only day

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:09.720
one and we had another two weeks here yet. Back at the house in the hills we unpacked

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:15.120
and renewed our acquaintances with the neighbours as well as the clothes stored last year. A

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:20.280
walk through the village and an early by Greek standards supper in a village restaurant under

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:27.280
the stars. Plenty of fresh cooked local recipes, a jug of cold wine. Perfect. The next day

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:34.280
we were joined on the terrace for our breakfast by the ginger cat we befriended on earlier

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:40.440
stays. This time she was alone. Last year she brought two young cats with her. After

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:45.520
breakfast we drove to town to meet with the architect to choose bathroom fittings. We

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:50.240
had a look around the town as the arranged meeting was later in the morning. It was bustling

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:56.080
as usual. The Marina car park near the office had introduced yet another revolutionary ticketing

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:02.360
system but the cost remained at three euros for the whole day. We strolled through town,

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:09.360
said hello to a few people we recognised including the architect's mum in her shop. I put credit

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:15.320
on our Greek phone, browsed the bookshop and generally tried to get ourselves into a Cretan

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:22.080
frame of mind for the drive with Manos to the bathroom emporium. In the office it was

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:28.840
the usual mix of good taste, smart furniture, glossy magazines and individual objects. Manos

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:34.800
only had one new challenge for us. He selected some low energy down lighters to be fitted

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:40.600
in the niches but showing one to us he pointed out that the light also came out sideways

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:46.320
and this was not sufficient for them. We need to locate ones that only light downwards and

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:53.320
remains voltage. Let me know the stockist or obtain a sample here on the island or back

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:59.960
in the UK. It appeared this was now our responsibility. Still perhaps this would leave him free to

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:06.960
resolve the hatch dilemma. A new lady computer aided designer was introduced to us and Manos's

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:14.200
dog made her usual low key fuss with her friendly but doleful eyes. Cold drinks were offered

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:20.480
but the usual clamour for Manos's attention from people both residents and visitors plus

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:27.480
the phones meant that he was keen to abandon the office. We followed as did his dog out

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:33.680
into the heat again and negotiated our way out of the town traffic to the bathroom store.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.840
Manos saw the sunroof and several windows were open and the minivan was left in the

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:44.480
canine custody of the dog. We had visited this builder's merchants before. It was on

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.200
the outskirts of town in a large building the front of which was a glass fronted showroom

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:55.440
housing swish bathroom fittings most of which were far too large for our purposes. There

00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:02.440
was also an impressive range of wall and floor tiles some in glass like jewels. Manos pleased

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:07.480
in and seemed to be known to the man behind one of the desks who waved before a younger

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:14.240
woman engaged him in a machine gun speak Greek conversation. It transpired she was to show

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:20.000
us the small wash basin and taps that she had selected for our wet room. We were led

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
upstairs to view these. This part of the visit was quite straightforward but it was soon

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.220
to degenerate into typical Manos inspired chaos. As far as we could tell there was some

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:35.660
inquiry from Manos about an order for a WC and whether they had papers which described

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:40.900
the dimensions. The conversation became more heated with the woman employing elaborate

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:47.900
hand gestures towards the WCs on display. After more low key Greek shouting the three

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:52.660
of us were led back downstairs to the office where a close examination of the paper filing

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:59.180
system as well as the scrutiny of the PC monitor took place. This must have been quite stressful

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:03.740
as the guy came in from the outside desk to help although his help seemed restricted

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:09.020
to accepting the offer of one of Manos' strong Greek architectural cigarettes which they

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:15.380
both smoked while reviewing some of the paper upside down. Gathering up two steel tape measures

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:21.920
we all reassembled upstairs and started measuring the WCs. The distance out from the wall seemed

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.820
to be the key measurement. Unfortunately some of these measurements needed to be compared

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:32.820
with the paper records still downstairs. Fortunately the building was air conditioned.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.540
When we trailed once more upstairs we were led through another door to be confronted

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:41.300
by a version of the closing sequence to the first Indiana Jones film, the scene where

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:48.300
the crated arc is stored away in a vast warehouse of other crates. I exaggerate but only slightly.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:54.020
The space is about ten times larger than the showroom and full of crates and large cardboard

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:59.940
boxes. Manos and the woman scuttled down the aisles examining the Greek writing in numbers

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:06.460
in some quest to locate a particular item. We hung around as confused bystanders until

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:12.720
some consensus had arrived over whether they had found what they were looking for. We reconvened

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:17.140
downstairs in the office relieved to see the smoking hadn't allowed the paperwork to

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:22.780
combust. After a brief conversation Manos announced it was time to go and the WC had

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:29.580
been selected. Did we want to try it? Sitting in my shorts on a WC in a mercifully quiet

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:35.820
showroom certainly didn't figure as one of my least embarrassing experiences. Still we'd

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:42.820
apparently saved some 150 euros over a previously identified compact one. We were a bit mystified

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:49.540
but reassured by Manos who stated that the plumber could now proceed. Later the same

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:53.580
day two events occurred. We were able to switch on the lights in the house for the

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:59.900
first time and Greek TV announced the country's first case of Mexican swine flu. The events

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:05.700
were unconnected as far as we were aware. Wednesday found us up early shopping near

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:11.300
the harbour at the weekly market. It wasn't long before I had to restrain Stephanie. Stop

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:17.460
I don't think I can carry any more. How much did we spend? Apparently less than ten euros

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:23.100
and that included a four euro jar of honey. We had a large bag of mixed sweet peppers,

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:29.740
artichokes, aubergines, big beef tomatoes, a big bag of beautiful yellow potatoes and

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:35.140
plenty of other things. After dropping the supplies back at the village house we drove

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:41.020
over to review building progress. Manos was already there talking to the back of the plumber

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:46.060
who was working on the pumps in the cavities under the ground floor. Most of this system

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:50.860
seemed quite mysterious to me but it seemed to be one of those areas you just had to trust

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:56.700
the experts. The plumbing was most effective in the loan house so evidence appeared to

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:02.060
be supportive of this action. The plumber broke off to shake hands and lead us into

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:08.060
the tiny bathroom where amazingly the WC was plumbed in. This was the one that was the

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:13.580
subject of so much discussion only yesterday. We agreed the positions of the basin and the

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:19.740
shower and diplomatically withdrew to let him get on with it. Later that day whilst

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:25.100
trying to drive to a local viewpoint we came across an abandoned village and I couldn't

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:30.220
help noticing that most of the houses resembled the house during the last visit. Walls are

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:35.900
bare stone, no roofs, gaping holes instead of shutters. There had been progress on the

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:42.540
project, slow progress but progress nevertheless. That evening we arranged a visit to the south

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:47.020
of the island for later in the week to meet up with an old friend who is now the proud

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:52.780
owner of a building plot full of stones with spectacular views. At least it would allow

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:58.380
the architectonists and the builders to make progress or conduct convoluted discussions

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.380
with local builders merchants without our assistance.
