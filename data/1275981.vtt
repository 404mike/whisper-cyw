This is chapter 13 in our series of short stories in relation to the race riots in Wales in 1919.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:21.520
Chapter 13 is actually the 1919 race riots in Liverpool. This podcast is drawn from a film

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.640
produced and directed by Hatch TV made in partnership with WALW, Writing on the Wall,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.280
and the Geography Department of Liverpool University. It is narrated by Jannia Pickett

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.120
and we're grateful to them for giving their permission for us to use this within our project.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.440
Today this area of Liverpool forms a vibrant and diverse community whose many cultures live

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.880
peacefully side by side. Here in the Baltic Triangle there is a thriving creative industry,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.680
but in 1919 things were very different and these streets witnessed unprecedented racial violence,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.400
bloodshed and murder. This short film looks at some of the people and places featured in

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.080
the Great Water Race Riot Archive which can be explored online and in a book available from

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.960
Writing on the Wall.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.720
In 1919, as today, the city's diverse population reflected its long heritage as a thriving port.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.120
The area around Chinatown and the Baltic Triangle was known as Sailor Town and was populated by

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.640
black, Chinese, Scandinavian, Russian, Ukrainian and Italian seafarers.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.160
During World War I, industries in Liverpool that had traditionally shunned black workers

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.640
welcomed men from West Africa and the Caribbean to fill the wartime labour shortage.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.280
Many worked as merchant seamen and in factories. At the end of the war, black men found themselves

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.080
out of work when a colour bar in employment was reintroduced. They were blamed for the post-war

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.800
economic slump and, backed by the local press, the mayor of Liverpool, John Ritchie,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.040
sought to repatriate the city's black workers.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.280
Throughout the summer of 1919, racial violence erupted in seaports throughout the UK.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.640
On the 4th of June, John Johnson, a West Indian man who lived here at 48 Nelson Street,

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.720
was brutally stabbed by two Scandinavian men for refusing to give them a cigarette.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.400
The following evening, Johnson's friends retaliated by attacking a group of Scandinavians

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.040
at a pub on Bailey Street. This sparked a wave of racial violence against black people by white mobs

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.200
in their thousands. On the 5th of June, police raided 18 Upper Pitt Street. A young Bermuda

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.800
sailor, Charles Watton, was at home and leave during the raid. Charles fled the house and was

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.040
chased by the police and an angry mob.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.160
Charles was pursued here to Queen's Dock, where he was either pushed or fell into the water.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.440
Under the hail of missiles, Charles was hit unconscious on the head with a rock and drowned.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.720
Violence intensified over the next few nights with thousands of people attacking black homes

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.680
and boarding houses. Hundreds of black men and their families were housed in police stations

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.040
for their own safety. Following the riots, the Chief Constable of Liverpool and the Queen's

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.800
Home Office made plans for the repatriation of black colonial workers.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.360
The Killing of Charles and the Race Riot of 1919 stand as a landmark event and watershed

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.360
for Britain's black community.
