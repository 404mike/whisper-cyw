00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160
Going starting now. Hello, good afternoon. Hello, good afternoon.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.360
Could you please tell us who you are and I'm Kanti. My full name is Kanti Moinath

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:27.560
and I was a GP. I just retired recently. That's lovely. Now Dr. Nath, tell me, when

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:35.440
did you come to this country? I came to this country in 1973, 23rd of June. I remember.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.480
That's quite a way back now. Now tell me when did you first come to Cardiff or this area?

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:50.480
1981, 10th of June. Excellent. And you know where I'm heading. I'm heading to the

00:00:50.960 --> 00:01:00.840
Which was your first puja in Cardiff? In 1981 I moved to Cardiff and then obviously I met a lot

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:10.240
of people here, mainly in the Bengali community. Then we went to see the puja and it was held in

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:23.520
in Rubaina Church Hall and it was well attended by the community from the Cardiff. Excellent. So

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.640
that was 1981 Rubaina Church Hall. Excellent. And was that a proper five days puja? Yes, it was.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:42.400
Since 1981, let me put this in different brackets. Now tell me what you have experienced through 1981

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:57.880
and 1985. Right, 1981 when they came there used to be two pujas. Two groups of Hindu community,

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:08.640
they are doing two pujas. And 1981 was the time when I attended that puja, it was discussed to

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:17.200
become together. Okay. And it was very seriously discussed in the sort of like a committee level

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:29.400
and it became together in 1982. Okay. And the name was given Wales Puja Committee. Okay. And the Wales

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:40.320
Puja Committee was recognized in 1982. Lovely. And was it in 1982 that it became a registered charity or was it a few years after?

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:52.280
1982. Okay. Lovely. Now Dr. Nath, another thing. Since you have been involved with the puja since 1981,

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.720
what has your role been over the years? Have you been involved actively with the puja committee?

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:07.080
Have you been doing various chores with the puja committee? Yes. Gradually I was sucked into the Wales

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:16.080
Puja Committee and started becoming an active member and doing lots of things like, you know,

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:25.680
going to like as any other committee, as well as we were involved in small little jobs like cooking and,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:35.520
you know, the arrangement of the stage and decorations and managing other things. As I understand,

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.760
you were also part of the management. You had you held certain roles in the community, like being the chairperson,

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:57.400
being the secretary. Yes. I was chairperson. I did the job of secretary. I was treasurer. And what else? I was

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:08.240
I was an active member in a way. Really? So that means there was, there has to be a form of election to get the results.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:18.480
Yes. Yes. We always, every year we used to have an election and with the proper way as we do for the other elections.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:26.640
And people, the members who had selected for the executive committee. Okay. And they were elected and

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.880
they used to do their job. When was the first big change that you noticed?

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:43.720
In which sense? You know, the overall function in the puja, creating Durga, you know, participating

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:58.440
in a big way, almost nationally. I think we were known nationally when we started making our first

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:12.760
Durga project or Durga image with two artists from India came. And then it was known to quite a lot of

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:21.560
people and the committees all over UK. Were there other things you did to put forward or present

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.200
WPC into the image of the normal people of Cardiff or South Wales?

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:41.640
Yes, I think we participated in London in a function which was organized by the Alandavajar

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:53.320
and we had a sort of a couple of items performed by the Wales Puja Committee members.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:02.760
All right. That's interesting. But I thought I've heard that you people participated in

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.520
functions to involve the people of Wales, like certain mailers.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:20.680
Yes, we did three mailers since the 1990s. Dr. Nath, what is a mailer? Mailer is a sort of like a

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:32.600
we arrange it for a day. It's for the general public. With all the Indian culture is shown

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:41.160
and the food and dance and dramas and all the shops and people are all invited and it was a free

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:47.800
entrance and people came in. They enjoyed the food, they enjoyed the cultural functions and

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.040
it was a very successful. Lovely. Do you think the profile of Wales Puja Committee has grown over the

00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:00.520
years? Yes, yes it has. Do you have a permanent place where you do your functions?

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:09.880
We haven't got a permanent place of our own. Can I interrupt here? Listen, Dr. Nath, why since

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:16.520
this function, this committee has been growing over the years since the early 80s, why haven't

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:26.440
you got a place of your own? It's very difficult to answer that because it involves funding.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:35.240
It involves funding. It needs more manpower and mainly the funding was the reason for that.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:43.640
And if we get funding in future, probably we'll have our own place. Would you think you'll be able

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:50.360
to sustain a place of your own? Yes, we can. Okay. Because we are capable people. Lovely. Good.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.960
Thank you very much, Dr. Nath. Thank you.
