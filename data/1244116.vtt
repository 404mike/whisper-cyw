How did we spend Fridays and Saturday night?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We spend Friday and Saturday spending time with you.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Yeah.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
At your bungalow, don't we?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Yeah.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And sometimes you come up to Acorns to see me as well.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Yeah.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Do you two go out sometimes for meals?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Oh yeah, because we used to go out to a table.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Yes.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Sometimes, don't we?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Yeah.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And we go to cinemas with my mum, don't we?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Yes.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
On a Saturday.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Yeah.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We're here to see Maramere.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Yes.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And Patterson too.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Yeah.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And what were we going to see over here?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Ah, can't think now.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I know.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Christopher Robin.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
That's it, yeah, Christopher Robin.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
That's it, love.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Yeah?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Yeah.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Okay.
