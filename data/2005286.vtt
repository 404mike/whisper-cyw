My name is Paul Hawkins and I've been going to gigs in Newport since the mid-80s.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.920
I'm a proprietor of Diverse Vinyl, formerly Diverse Music.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.520
Been a DJ around town, student nights and got involved with gigs and various other bits

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.520
and pieces that come your way whilst running a record shop I suppose.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.720
The first gig I ever saw in Newport was Public Enemy in Newport Centre.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.720
It's one of those things where people say, what's your most memorable gig?

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.040
And my initial reaction is, wow, there's too many gigs to think about.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:47.200
I've been going to gigs since about mid-80s I would say in Newport and there's far too

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.200
many to even consider a memorable one.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.080
But suddenly a memorable gig out of nowhere just pings out into my mind and one that really

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.960
springs to mind to me was British Sea Power playing at Le Pub.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:09.440
Phenomenal band in their infancy at the time, just full of energy and enthusiasm and the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.440
songs were quite varied.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.240
They did a particularly long song called Lately, I remember which went on for about 40 minutes.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.520
The band ended up, obviously there's a lot of bands that did it in Le Pub, Hanging From

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.880
the Rufters, yeah just a generally brilliant, brilliant performance.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.800
Fairly sparse, which is quite often the case.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.560
You'll find those gigs that are most memorable, you leave wondering why there weren't more

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.680
people there with you.
