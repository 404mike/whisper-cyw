00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I witnessed to, in Falderdraer, one young lad, he was about 17 I think, his first eye in the ground, he was killed, he was working with his uncle, and Stone came round and killed him.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Then another man then, Bert Trigonin, he was working on his coal face, he was told not to go back behind the conveyor where there was nothing holding the roof up, he was told not to go back, he went back there and Stone came round and killed him.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Then in the pit, when I worked in the pit, there was one man, he was a Polish boy he was, he came to work one morning, he bought a second on bike for his son, he was going to do it up for Christmas for him, and he left the bike in the pit at Baths and he went to work and he was killed that morning. So those three accidents I witnessed some time ago I know.
