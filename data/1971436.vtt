00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480
My name is David James. I'm 83 and I was born in London. Perhaps I should explain,

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:16.120
in 1926 the Pembroke Dockyard closed and there was a tremendous impact on

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.920
Pembroke Dock because many, many men lost their jobs. Father went to London, he

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.760
married mother, I was born and then in the dreadful blitz of 1940 our house was

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.080
blown to bits by the little man with a small mustache. Dad said, oh dear, mother

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.920
was very strong, she said we're all alive, none of us are injured, we haven't got a

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.080
house, so dad said right we will go back to our ancestral home in Pembrokeshire

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.800
because after all our ancestral home if you like in

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.920
Pembrokeshire we've lived here for 300 years so I'm nearly local. Well Pembroke

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.520
Dock where we initially intended to live, the day before we got back that house

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:12.160
was bombed so we had a bit of a rough time but we ended up living in a little

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.240
farm in Causheuston, the village where I now live and then just before the end of

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.640
the war in 1944 I think we moved into Pembroke Dock when I was about six. We

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.000
lived in the middle of a terrace, none of us had any money so we never locked the

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.360
front door but we had a happy life you know. I used to play with all the other

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:42.080
kids in the street and our big adventure was to have a den but the den was in a

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.360
bombed house at the bottom of our garden because at Pembroke Dock at the time

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.280
there were bombed houses all over the place you know. Our house was just up the

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.400
road from the beach, well the beach in a kind turn because it was a muddy

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.440
estuary you know so I was forever down there getting dirty and playing about and

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.480
looking for crabs and things that small boys do you know.
