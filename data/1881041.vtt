00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
My dad must have been one of the younger ones because he was 17.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
A lot of people have written about the hardships of internment,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
but my dad just had funny stories to tell and regarded the whole thing as a bit of an adventure.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Which maybe because of his age it was.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
One thing he said, it was very cold in Canada.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So first he was sent to Highton in Liverpool, which was a holding camp.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Then he was sent to the Isle of Man and he did tell all these stories.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I mean, I heard them fresh from him without any sense of cliche about how the Isle of Man, it was like a university to him.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
He learned such a lot about music, the Amadeus Portet.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
He heard them play. He learned to play bridge, which was his lifelong passion.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And he learned all sorts of things. It was really a real education.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And obviously he was surrounded by sort of middle European Jewish people who were the milieu that he was used to.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So there was a sort of comfortable.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
He told you stories about the food, the rations were absolutely rubbish in Canada.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
But you had all these Vietnamese pastry chefs and they take all the rations and all this awful meat, quality meat that were being sent.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Make it into salami and sell it back to the Canadians at a profit.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
But one thing that must have been missing.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So I've got not all, but I've got about 15 or 20 letters that my dad wrote home from the internment camp.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And it was, please send, I mean, he wasn't very.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
He didn't say very much, quite large writing, quite small paper.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Please send warm trousers and chocolate.
