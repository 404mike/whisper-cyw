00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
By staying in the Crizzau house we've placed some distance between the house renovation project and us.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It meant we could treat the stay as more of a holiday.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The downside was that any site visits to the house meant a 20 mile round trip,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but at least we could separate ourselves from the slow progress on the renovation.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The benefits included experiencing life in a Greek house in a village and living in a new place.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Our stay in the house as the first residence since the rebuild led to a misunderstanding.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This took place on the second afternoon of our stay.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We were locking the front door to take a stroll up into the village for a coffee or a cold drink

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
when we were hailed from the garden next door.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
An elderly smiling man was calling to us from his chair at a table on a shady terrace behind the house next door.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We replied good afternoon in our best Greek,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but he indicated that we should come into his garden and sit down.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It seemed only polite to comply and to explain we were going out in our Greek might make conversation tricky

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and it was a more difficult option.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We all sat down and all smiled at each other.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Names were exchanged, he was called Michaelis,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and he pushed some of the walnuts he was cracking open towards us.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Smiling, he showed us that the nuts were ripe enough to be cracked open using bare hands.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The brief conversation was punctuated by a chorus of barking from a small dog

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
tethered to a kennel in a separate fenced off part of the shady garden.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
We were asked if we liked the nuts and replied in broken Greek with a question whether they were from the garden.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
This was met with laughter, no no from Catharow.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
This was a plateau higher up in the mountains that we knew was heavily cultivated with products beyond the ubiquitous olive trees.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The walnuts, or as we now learnt, cremithia, were delicious.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Unfortunately their dryness started me coughing.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Eleni called Michaelis with a surprisingly loud voice.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
We heard some noise from behind a curtain over the door

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and a very small lady wearing an apron, her silver hair pinned up in a bun, appeared from inside the house.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
She was introduced as Eleni, his wife, and was quickly instructed to bring us drinks.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Raki, the great brandy for me, with fresh orange juice provided for the ladies.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:39.000
When I questioned whether Michaelis was drinking Raki, he indicated a heart condition with cardiac, the Greek for heart, giving us cardiac in English.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.000
We sat there, the three of us smiling at one another, with the diminutive Eleni at a similar height, although she was still standing up.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I offered her my seat, but Michaelis quickly directed her into the house.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Minutes later she appeared with a plate of peeled and sliced apple.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
This was followed by a plate of peeled pear.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
At last Eleni produced a tiny child-sized chair from behind the curtain and sat down.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
It was time for a conversation that we would have to get used to in Crete.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
One of the first questions a Greek asked you is, how old are you?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Usually quickly followed by their age and questions and statements about children and grandchildren.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000
After we owned up about our ages, we were informed that Michaelis was 82 and Eleni was 92.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000
We were dealing with the oldest waitress and her toy boy that we'd encountered so far on the island.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
The combined effect of the unaccustomed heat admittedly tempered by the shade of the garden,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
the moonracky and the stress of Greek conversation meant that we would need to make our excuses and leave.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
We achieved this only after accepting a large bag of warm nuts and pears.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Putting those inside the front door, we continued our stroll into town,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
but this would not be our last conversation in the neighbour's garden.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
The Hill Village was a tourist destination during the day,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
with both cars and coaches bringing visitors to the long winding High Street,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
with its collection of cafes, taverns and craft shops.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Lace, leather, pottery and glassware, as well as carved olive wood,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
filled the shops and spilled onto tables on the narrow pavement.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
In previous visits we'd call there for a drink or a meal,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000
sometimes en route to the higher Cathro Plateau, now known to us as the source of Michaelis's Walnuts.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
In the centre of the village was a small square,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
where there were a number of bars and taverns which shared the space and placed their tables and chairs.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
We stopped for a nice coffee and reflected on the generous hospitality we'd received from our new neighbours.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
We also speculated whether we would always be ambushed when leaving the house.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I couldn't be spending every outing in a rakie as pleasant as it was.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Although the days were often spent visiting the house project and driving out of the village on sorties to our favourite island spots,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
most evenings found us back in the village.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:18.000
We mixed our time between using the kitchen at home to rustle up some Cretan cuisine and eating suppers out in the village.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
In any event, most evenings when we were there we walked round the village for a stroll.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
The place took on a different character at night.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Most of the tourist craft shops are shut, but the local food stores, bakers, butchers, hairdressers, ironmongers,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000
as well as the cafes and taverns reopened for evening business, sometimes until a surprisingly late hour.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
This made the large village quite a buzzing place at night.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
As we became more recognised through the frequency of our strolls,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
it was apparent that we had not just driven to the village for a well-off supper.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Quite often we were politely asked where we were staying, not an unreasonable request,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
as we had only spotted a couple of small buildings with rooms to rent signs.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
The village, some 20 minute drive from the coast, was more of a day-trip destination.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
In the evenings we recognised the same people sitting outside their houses,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and the council of Cullinithcys developed into longer conversations.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
By the end of the week we were chatting about our plans for our house, their children,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
culinary recommendations, the changes on the island.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
It was a very pleasant experience and something we looked forward to.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
There was the attendant benefit of being donated fruit and vegetables.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
You must try our apricots from the garden, they are very good this season.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
We started to feel guilty not having anything to offer in return,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
but we were assured by Manos when we discussed this dilemma with him

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
that most families had some connection with tourism

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and just saw a collective benefit in our stay.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
One morning there was a knock on the front door.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Stephanie opened it and for a split second thought that no one was there,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
until looking down she saw all four foot six of Eleni looking up at her, smiling,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and holding a plate full of warm cheese pies as a gift.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000
This was so kind and they were delicious, melting the mouth pastry covering warm feta cheese,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
contrasting with a coating of sweet local honey.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
We called round later that day to take the neighbours some flowers as a thank you for the gift

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and their early hospitality to us.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
There was some stilted conversation by us due to our limited Greek,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
but it appeared that we should stay as Michalis wanted us to meet someone.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
A few minutes later a smiling young lady carrying a gift wrap box came into the garden.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
The mystery was soon cleared up.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
This was their granddaughter and much to our relief spoke fluent English.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
She worked as a secondary school teacher in the next town.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Katarina had been phoned to be told about her grandparents' new neighbours

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and had been asked to come and translate the conversation.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Drinks and plates were brought and a box of cakes was opened.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
My grandparents are very pleased to have you as their new neighbours

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and hope you will be happy in your new house.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
We thanked her, but explained we were only borrowing the house for stays

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
while our house renovation in another village was being arranged

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
and the house belonged to the architect.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
This comment was met with confused looks and an exchange in Greek between our hosts and Katarina.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
They are sorry, they thought you had bought the house.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
My grandfather wants to know which village you prefer.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
I replied that we both liked his village very much.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Then he asked why have you bought a house in another village then?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
This was not going to be easy.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
The cost schedule and a shock

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
After some wait it arrived, the email with the promised schedule of costs and it was a shock.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
We discussed different components and had in the early stages been given some rough costings for the essential works.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
The final figure was a consolidated total, which could be described as a total turnkey cost

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
with the schedule to include final cleaning, site clearance, painting and decorating

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
and making some bespoke furniture that we had discussed, but it was too much.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
It felt like one of the low points of the project.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
During the last visit to the island we completed detailed plans

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and even included where two-way light switches would be.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:35.000
The details were an opportunity to properly consider how the necessary storage could be incorporated into the small areas we were working with.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Some of these plans were very creative and exciting

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and were a continuation of the periodic debate about our niches.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.000
The incorporation of glass panels and built-in storage was certainly a great way of making the most of the small dark rooms,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
but the reality of the cost of this bespoke design was a sobering wake-up call.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
For a few days we did nothing. We were shocked. It was much more than we were expecting.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
When we did talk about it we considered some extreme options,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
which included valuing the house for the building permit and putting it up for sale.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Another less radical option would be to put the renovation on hold and moving on a camping basis,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:24.000
using water from the village tap, solar battery lights or a generator and awaiting the arrival of mains drainage.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
An option already rumoured to be employed by an American owner living around the corner.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Then we considered abandoning the architect and looking for another builder to quote,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
although I have this was practical from a distance of almost 2,000 miles.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Thinking how we got to this point, we recalled so many discussions and options that have been thought of,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
refined or developed or ultimately discarded.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Surely it wouldn't end with us selling it before we'd ever stayed there.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
At the first meeting with Manos we'd considered the roof terrace and the small balcony,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
the lack of a view and difficulties in creating openings in order to achieve this

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and later when planning consents were being arranged there were awkward dialogues with the planners

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
when there was a need to convince them we weren't trying to create a third story

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
but only a small terrace to allow us to see the view.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000
At that point we considered abandoning the terrace idea and constructing some bizarre viewing platform

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:30.000
in the corner of the first floor room and making a virtue out of this by placing much needed storage underneath.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
At this point I decided to contact someone we'd met in one of the other villages

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
whose house had already been renovated by Manos.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
This provided some welcome reassurances as their experience had been very similar.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
It was reassured that this all in price was certainly negotiable

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
and had in all probability been partially caused by our interest in design additions.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
When we similarly asked where costs could be reduced they'd been told, everywhere.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So the discussions began.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
It was right, the question was met with the same answer, of course everywhere.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Certainly any activity we would have carried out ourselves at home was to be excluded

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
so internal decorating was out.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
There were also the more adventurous elements which when suggested and the costs had been questioned

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
were normally met with, no it would not be expensive.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
When all of these were added together expense did seem an issue.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
The glass spiral staircase up to the terrace was questioned.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Yes, they would in fact be more expensive than the more normal metal staircase.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Right, we'll be having metal then.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
At the end of some of these discussions we took stock with Manos.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
The house would still be interesting with these changes, of course.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And we would still use some glass to get light down through the house.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Yes, that would still be done.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Okay then.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
It was agreed that Manos would completely review the cost schedule

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
with a view to removing optional costs

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
as well as any costs or activities we could do ourselves such as decorating.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
We had an anxious couple of weeks awaiting the new quotation

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
wondering whether we would have to reconsider Mothball or even completely abandon the project.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
It was a real low point in the whole enterprise

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and to make things worse that summer was a particularly miserable one in Sussex.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Cold and wet.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
The idea of a completed holiday home in the sun seemed particularly appealing

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
but it seemed a distant prospect.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
A revised cost schedule arrived late that summer

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
but certainly made a reduction to the total

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and several weeks of revisions followed back and forth between Crete and Sussex.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
It was agreed that the final draft would be signed

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
when we returned for our autumn holiday in a few weeks' time.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Works to start.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
The October trip had seen us staying in the renovated house in the hills again.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000
The main activity on this visit was the finalising of the works and project management contract.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Email drafts had been exchanged back and forth between Crete and Sussex the previous month

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
and we really hoped to finalise details of the costs and sign the contract.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
The island was warm as usual for this time of year.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
The progress to this point had seemed slow with a delay on planning consents

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
followed by long discussions and emails about how the house should be designed.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
The lack of space limited some options but also meant that more care was necessary

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
with the limitations placed on it by this.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Manus' office was again inspirational with shelves full of architectural books

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
and glass tables laden with glossy magazines.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
One evening we were introduced to the idea of using a small mini digger

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
to dig out the septic tank under the house

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
and we were given an explanation of how access could be created

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
by removing half of the front wall.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
In short order we were introduced to the plant operator who called into the office.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
He unsuccessfully tried to reassure us by showing a photo of his mini digger on his phone

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
while giving us focal impressions of it.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
I must admit we were far from reassured.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Staying in the renovated house had a number of advantages for us.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
It allowed us to more carefully consider our real requirements for storage

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
as well as day to day living in a warm climate.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
The house had a number of features that we enjoyed

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
and hoped could be incorporated into the design of our own house.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
There was a coolness in the downstairs room

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
held by small windows, shutters and the ability to get a through draft,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
taking the warm air up the stairs and out onto the terrace.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
The terrace itself provided both shade and sun

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
and proved to be the place for breakfast under the shade and supper at sunset.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Colour in the house was generally limited to highlights

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
so the background colour had been lighter and cooler.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Lighting was flexible with feature lighting and useful dimmers.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
High level storage made most of the space.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Sympathetic mixes of contrasting materials provided interest.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Glass, thick ply cut across the layers, exposed stone, limed wood and painted concrete,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
recycled old wood with faded paint, aged olive wood beams.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
These requirements were discussed at length, both by ourselves and later with Manos in his office

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000
and more leisurely under the stairs over supper on one of the terraces of one of the restaurants.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Some decisions were made during these talks.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
The ground floor would have a stone floor as lightly coloured as possible

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
and soft irregular shaped tiles.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
There wouldn't be a chimney or a wood stove.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
The space it would need could not be sacrificed.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Seating areas were needed on all floors and should be combined with storage.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Some of this could be fixed.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
An emergency water tank was advised for when the main supply was interrupted.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
This could be placed in the floor and linked to a pump.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Some supply of water would be useful to the roof terrace, a small sink perhaps.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Some screening on the terrace for shading and privacy was needed.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Various ways of bringing light into the ground floor was talked about again.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Some glass panels in the floor was a possibility, bringing natural light down through the building.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
A small safe should be provided with enough space for storing a laptop computer.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Some of the old wood that had been saved from the house could be recycled and used as features.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000
The signing of the works contract itself was toasted in the office with glasses of champagne.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
The talking, planning and thinking phase was at last at an end,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
or at least we hoped it was.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:53.000
The celebrations were indeed premature, as could be seen from a few sample emails from Crete that were sent to us that winter.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
November. Greetings to you both.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
It's still raining here.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
We need a two week period without any rain at all,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:08.000
and it needs to be completely dry before we start demolishing so that we do not have problems.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
We will inform you when we can start.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Best wishes, Mannals.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
December past, and Christmas came and went in England and Crete.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
We seemed to have drifted into another period of inactivity on the project.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:29.000
We had agreed everything, signed the contracts and be told that builders and specialists were ready and willing to start, eager even.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000
It seemed ironic that wet weather in Crete was delaying things. England was sunny and cold.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
We awaited news.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
17th January.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Many greetings to you and I hope you are both well.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
I am pleased to inform you we are finally starting works on Wednesday next week.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
I will keep you informed.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Best wishes to you from a warm and sunny Crete.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Kandrigarj, Mannals.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Many greetings.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Thanks for the funds transfer.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
The electrician started with the electric connection to the mains.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:08.000
As soon as we sign the connection contracts and have also electricity, the water is connected, we will start.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Finally, an email arrived on sunny February morning in Sussex.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
We have finally started.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
This is the depth achieved after 30 hours of digging.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:25.000
The initial debris and stone has already been transported away and this is what we are doing every two days.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
It is extremely hard.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
I am attaching seven photos and keep you updated.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Best regards, Mannals.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Arfer i'r e-mail erbyn ddwy ffotau.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Roeddwn ni wedi dweud yn ein cyfleoedd,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
nifer o ffotau o'r bwyd a'u bwyd yn cael eu hwyl yn y gron,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
yn cael eu cymorth,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
yn y ffordd o'r ddwy ffyrdd o archeoleg,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
a nid oes yn ein haws yn ôl.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Roedd y ffotau yn gweld y pwynt y byddwn i'r ddwy ffyrdd o'r haws yn cael eu hwyl yn y ffyrdd o'r ddwy ffyrdd.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Y ffotau cyntaf oedd y ddwy ffyrdd jcb style Degar,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
a'i ddwy ffyrdd yn y ffordd ar y haws.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Roedd yn ymddygiad y ffyrdd narydd.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Yn y ffordd y byddwn yn cael ymddygiad o'r cyffanion Maria.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Roeddwn yn gobeithio bod y tŷfn a'r ddwy ffyrdd

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
yn gallu bod yn ymwneud â rhai o bwydau nesaf o'r ddwy ffyrdd yng Nghymru.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Y ffotau ddwy ffyrdd yma oedd y llwyf yn y ffordd o'r haws.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Y ffyrdd yn ystod gyda'i camau i'r ffyrdd,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
yn ymwneud â'i baro'n y ffyrdd.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Mae'r ddwy ffyrdd yn y ffordd o'r haws

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
yn ymwneud â'r cyffanion o'r mwyaf a'r bwydau o'r roedd.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Roeddwn yn gallu gweld y ddwy ffyrdd yma

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
gyda'r hysbysau hydrolig llwyf

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
yn ymwneud â'r gwaith a'i ddysgu yn y ffordd o'r haws.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Ar y ffordd o'r haws,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
a'r ffaith yn ymwneud â'r ystod y ffordd,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
roedd ymglwm ddwy ffyrdd o'r ddwy ffyrdd.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Y ffotau ddwy ffyrdd yma oedd yn fwy o'r ffyrdd,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
roedd y ffyrdd yn fwy o'r ffyrdd.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Roeddwn yn e-mail yn ôl.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Diolch.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Mae'n rhan o ddwy ffrindiau wedi bod yn fwy o ffrindiau

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
am rhan a chyffredin.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Rydyn ni'n cael ei ddweud yn fwy o ffrindiau.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Diolch yn fwy.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Helo.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Yn ymwneud â'ch gwella,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
roedd y ddwy ffyrdd yn ymwneud â'r ffyrdd

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
yn ymwneud â'r ffyrdd,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
a'n ymwneud â'r ffyrdd.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Rydw i'n gwella ffotau ffyrdd,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
un o'r ffyrdd yma yma.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Ychwanegwch eich ddwy ffrindiau.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Mae'n rhan o ddwy ffrindiau.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
17 Febrer.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Diolch.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Mae'n snŵr.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Fe wnaethon ni ddwy ffrindiau ymlaen.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Mae'r pwytydd yn cael ei ddwy ffrindiau

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
yn ymwneud â'r ffyrdd.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Rydw i wedi ceisio ddysgu'r ddwy ffrindiau

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
yn fyw,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
ac hefyd y ddwy ffrindiau yn ymwneud â'r rhan

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
yn y ffrindiau.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Os y ffrindiau fwyaf oedd yn ymwneud

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
yma fel y gallwn ni'n planu,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
i gynnwys gos,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
mae'r gwella gwella gwella

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
ddim oedd yn cael ei ddwy ffrindiau.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Rydyn ni wedi'i hwstio'r ddwy ffrindiau

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
ar gyfer amser,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
chweithio'r ddwy ffrindiau yn hollol

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
i ddwy ffrindiau,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
ac yn gwneud yn ddwy ffrindiau,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
ond mae'r ddwy ffrindiau yn fy nghyfn,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
felly mae'n yn gwneud y ffrindiau'n ddwy ffrindiau

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Rydw i'n gwella'r gwella gwella

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
a chweithio'r ddwy ffrindiau.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Mae'n dod i'r gwella'n gwella'n gwella.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Yn y cyfnod, rhai pethau o'n byw

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
yn gwella o'r gwella a phynhwystiaeth

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
o'r gwella,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
oherwydd bod y gwella'n ymwneud

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
ar unrhyw ddwy ffrindiau roch

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
yn dda, oherwydd yr hyn rydym wedi'i gwella.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Mae'r ffrindiau wedi'i gwella.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Rydw i'n gwella 8 ficturau

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
yn cael ar 14 Febreriau

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
a 6 ficturau yma.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Rydw i'n fwyaf i'n ddweud i mi

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
bod yw'r holl bwysau wedi'i gwella

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
yn y 26 o Marll.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Felly, roedd yn dda i'n gwella.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Rydw i'n gwella.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Ar ôl ymddechrau cymdeithasol

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
a chydrwch y gwella,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
roeddwn yn gallu gwybod beth oedd yn ymwneud

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
am y gwaith o'r gwaith yma

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
ac i ddweud yn fwyaf am y cwmaint cymdeithasol

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
yn y gwella yma am rhai fwyaf sy'n gwella

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
oherwydd bod y gwella yn dda

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
a'r gwaith yn ymwneud am y cwmaint cymdeithasol

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
yn y gwaith yma.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Mae'r cyhoedd yn dda.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Mae'r cyhoedd yn dda.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Mae'r e-mails nesaf yn dweud

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
bod y gwaith yn ymwneud

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
ar 26 o Marll.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Mae'n dda i'w gwybod

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
yn dda i ddwy o ffyrdd yn dda

i fod yn cyfrannu â siaradau bwyd

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
cymaint o ffotau o ffotau

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
