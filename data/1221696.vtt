Do you know how easy it was for your parents to stay kosher in Tudiga?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I think food probably mainly came from Cardiff.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I know before Passover my grandfather had to go to Cardiff and bring stocks,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and you had to manage with what you had. If you ran out, you couldn't get more,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
except that in those days a lot of the kosher standards were different today.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
They opened a new sack of tea, a new sack of sugar, and that was fine,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
whereas today for Passover if you're observant, you only buy things

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that have got an authorized label on them before Passover.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I remember my grandfather, he must have brought it from Cardiff,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I do remember one nice little cameo of him bringing halava.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Do you know what halava is? It's a bar made from sesame seeds with added sugar.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It's quite a sweet meat, you can get it these days in the kosher shops,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
he comes from Israel. And I remember him cutting slivers of it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and handing it out to the grandchildren to taste.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
That must have come from Cardiff. So I presume many kosher foods came from Cardiff.
