00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
At the age of 16, I had an exam, an O level exam in the morning, which finished at 11.30.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And I had been offered a job on the mail boats.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And so on that particular morning, as I finished my exam, I rushed out to the exam room and ran down the hill

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and signed on with a person of the ship called a Cambria, which is in Holyhead Harbour.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And I was taken on as a mess boy.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And it's always been a dream that I could go to sea, that I would go to sea.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And I did actually go to sea. And I remember the two of us, Richard Jones and myself, we went down there

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and we sat on the, the person said, there are two jobs I got.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
He said, one is a mess boy and the other is a galley boy.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And Richard, who knew nothing about the sea, said, oh, I'd like to be a galley boy because that sounded better,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
because mess sounded untidy and, and, you know, and I was given a job as an officer's mess boy.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I had a white jacket and I served the captain and the chief engineer and he was a wonderful job.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And he spent the whole summer in the galley, which is the kitchen of the ship, peeling potatoes and washing dishes.
