WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.040
Martin Bell? Oh hello Martin, it's Marcia here. Hi, thanks for getting through to me.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.120
So I'm grateful to you for giving me your time this afternoon Martin, I really am. Oh

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.520
that's no problem, happy to. Oh thank you, because I'm actually recording this, is that

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.520
okay with you? Yes, sure, yes. And what I'll do is when I finish I'll transcribe it and

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:33.520
send you a copy so you can look through it and add or take away or correct, is that alright?

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.520
Fine, yeah. So I wonder how much time do you have? Well what's needed really, I don't

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.520
think, I haven't got anything else in my diary but I don't want to waste too much of your

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.800
time. Well I won't be more than an hour I would say. So I wonder if you could just in

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.080
your own words just introduce yourself, who you are and your involvement with the grant

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:09.080
living levels. Yes okay, well my name is Martin Bell and my day job is Professor of Archaeological

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:20.080
Science at the University of Reading. But for the last 38 years actually I've been doing

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:28.600
archaeological research in the seven estuary, originally on the English side at Breen Down

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:39.760
and then since 1991 on the Welsh side, particularly focused around Goldcliff where I've been looking

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:49.080
at sites dating from the Mesolithic period around 8,000 years ago right up to the end

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.920
of the Iron Age and we've excavated loads of sites and we're still working on the recording

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:04.880
of sites in that area. So when the Living Levels Project came along it was a really

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:12.600
great opportunity to convey some of the information that we've got out of all these years of work

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.840
on the archaeology of the foreshore of the seven estuary to a much wider audience and

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.000
to begin to train up local people in the sort of techniques which would enable them to record

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.200
sites in the future. So we've done a few training courses and we hope to do some more and we've

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.960
also had lots of lectures and we've helped Newport Museum with a new display on the archaeology

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.000
and helped the Newport Wetlands Centre with some archaeological material as well.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.880
So when you were working on the other side of the estuary did you look across and think

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.760
right we've got to check that place out too?

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:04.080
Yes partly, that was it because the same deposits occur on both sides but actually the main

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:13.840
catalyst was a skilled steelwork technician called Derek Upton who worked at Glenwerne who

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:22.160
started finding lots of sites and told us about them and got us involved in investigating them

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:31.080
and he worked with us for many years, well these 10 years, guiding us around the site showing us

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:40.200
what he'd found and you know we're still plugging away really recording and investigating many of

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.640
the sites that he found as well as other sites that we've found since then but you know he played

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:55.240
a really important part in alerting everybody to the rich prehistoric archaeology of the seven

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:04.840
estuary along with a very different character, an academic geologist called John Allen who was a

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:13.080
colleague of mine at Reading University who sorted out the sedimentary sequence of the whole of the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:20.120
seven estuary and was able to show that the deposits that Derek Upton had found wooden

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.760
structures and artifacts in were actually prehistoric. John Allen sadly died in the autumn

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.640
after a very successful career as a geologist.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:43.800
So did Derek approach you when you were still working in Bream or had you already come over here?

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:52.520
Sort of yes, I mean actually as far as I can remember the first point of contact when I

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:59.480
met both Derek Upton and John Allen was actually a conference that we had at Western Super Mayor

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.920
which was prompted by the threat at the time building the seven barrage and the conference

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:14.520
was really designed to try and alert people to the archaeology of the estuary and that's when

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:24.840
I think when I first met Derek Upton and John Allen and we they got me interested in

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:31.080
in the things that had been found on the Welsh side as well. So I might

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.920
um leap around a bit Martin so please bear with me.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:42.360
That's fine. So Derek was a steel worker absolutely no disrespect to him because I've

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.280
heard so much about him but why did you take him seriously?

00:05:48.040 --> 00:06:00.280
Um well I suppose because when he took me out to see things it made sense and also you know he was

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:08.120
a voluntary warden for the Gwent Wildlife Trust and I'm very interested in nature conservation

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:15.240
and wildlife so I mean we were talking the same language really we understood one another and

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:24.440
got on well and you know archaeology is a subject where anybody can make a really outstanding

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:32.520
discovery and and Derek did you know and and I think his great contribution was

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:40.280
was knowing the estuary so I mean he wandered around there from childhood yeah I mean that was

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:47.000
his that was his leisure time activity really and going out in the estuary looking at the

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.840
the birds and the wildlife and finding archaeology.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:07:00.040
So do you sorry carry on. So he got a really intimate knowledge of of it and and recognised

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:09.720
that when he was finding you know wood structures buried in sediments that that they must be quite

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:17.240
old well at first you know he did go along to some sort of professional academic archaeologists

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:24.120
and you know he got a bit of a brush off people said well you know they're probably very recent

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:29.560
and that sort of thing but the the trouble was you said they were working from a mindset of

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:36.680
dryland archaeology you know they knew what to expect in a um on a dryland site but at that time

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:44.120
um you know 30 odd years ago they hadn't really got their heads around the sorts of things that

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:53.320
you might find in a in a intertidal wetland and it all seemed a bit incredible but I think gradually

00:07:53.320 --> 00:08:00.040
I mean not just myself but other archaeologists Stephen Oldhouse Green at the National Museum

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:05.240
and Alastair Whittle in the Archaeology Department at Cardiff realised that what Derek was telling

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:12.360
us about you know made sense and was important and then we checked that out of course by getting

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:18.600
radiocarbon dates on some of these wood structures that he'd found um you know that some people

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:24.840
thought were probably going to be very modern and we discovered that they were bronze age or iron age

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:32.840
so the picture built up from there really. I know it's not a very academic um scientific

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.800
measurement but do you think he had a good instinct then for this? Oh yes yes he did yes

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:43.800
yes I think it's I think it's very pertinent actually that well his instinct was derived from

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:50.200
an intimate knowledge of the landscape really you know he'd looked at it he saw how the sediments

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:58.120
formed um and he realised that some of this stuff had got to be old yeah and I mean it included

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:05.320
things like you know footprints human footprints at Uskmouth um that we now know are you know

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:10.680
around 8 000 years old and I think you know I think a lot of people were probably fairly

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:17.720
skeptical of that to begin with but now of course we found these human footprints on lots of sites

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:24.600
and we know that they're buried in sediment sequences of known dates and so on um so um

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:31.080
you know I think it was his sort of intuitive understanding of the the landscape and the

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:37.240
environment that was enabled him to think outside the box actually that's really the key thing he

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:42.520
wasn't approaching it from the point of view of the sort of you know knowledge and understanding

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:48.840
of a trained archaeologist um which which might have which might have made him skeptical about

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:57.480
they were but but he was it was based on his own personal observation and deduction um you know

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:03.000
interestingly enough you know he wasn't somebody who found easy to write any of that down actually

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.760
yeah you know he was his passing on of knowledge was almost entirely by word of mouth actually

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:18.760
wow gosh so what sort of man was he oh a remarkable man really I mean very um

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:28.440
very kind and and generous um uh you know extremely knowledgeable about about wildlife and

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:34.200
and and the and the history of the estuary an absolute encyclopedia really

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:41.720
um well see what do you also describe into um I'm sure I've spoken to some of my team Bob Trett

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:48.760
that um he knew how to navigate that area beyond the scene wall you know where it was safe to walk

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:55.320
and stuff oh yes yes I mean he's the he that taught me that actually really you know it is quite a

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:01.320
it is quite a knack because there are dangerous places and you do have to be very careful

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:07.960
but he but he'd walked it all and he got a sort of map in his mind really I mean he couldn't have

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:15.160
drawn out a map I don't think yeah at least he never did but I mean he knew how to find things

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:23.800
um which he'd seen years before in some cases yeah because the mud you see the mud and sand

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:30.040
are moving around all the time so you know you can go down there you find something and then you

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:35.400
go back two weeks later to show somebody else and it and it's gone it's covered up for the next four

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:42.200
years or something um but he would be able to you know take you to a spot where he'd found something

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:52.360
years before um knew exactly where it was it's an astonishing ability although I think you know many

00:11:53.320 --> 00:12:00.200
sort of country people and um farmers and so on have a similar sense don't they of the patch that

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:07.880
they know yes Derek's patch was a bit more unusual you know it was about well at least 30 kilometers

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:19.080
long and um you know 500 meters wide sort of thing so what what what what were his spectacular

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:27.640
finds what were his most spectacular finds yeah um well I suppose um yes let's think about this

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:34.840
I mean there were there were many um but I think the human footprints at usk mouth were among the

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:46.040
most important um he was also um the main finder along with bob tret of the iron age buildings

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:54.200
at gold cliff which set off the whole of my research project there really um that that

00:12:54.200 --> 00:13:02.200
happened in 1991 after a big storm they went down there and they saw these rectangular buildings

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:08.920
um and at the time people thought oh well they've got to be quite recent um but we got

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.960
radiocarbon dates and they were iron age wow and we excavated them and we've been working there

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:23.160
ever since on sites of different dates gosh um so that was important and he also discovered the

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:32.440
bronze age settlement at redwick which we've excavated and he was um instrumental in the

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:38.200
discovery of the bronze age site at cauldicot which is not in the intertidal area but it's in a

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:46.520
in a lake that was made in the grounds of cauldicot castle and when they were making the lake um the

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:57.160
machines dug up bits of wood and some metal work and derrick realized that those were

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:03.560
prehistoric and reported them and that led to a to another big excavation I didn't do that

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:13.960
excavation it was done by nigel nailing also another one of his finds is the may gore pill

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:23.640
medieval boat that was found in a when um when he took some visiting german scholars to

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:31.720
to look at may gore pill during one of our field seasons and um and he realized that these bits

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:38.360
of timber sticking out of may gore pill were were part of a boat and that led to a an excavation

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:47.720
again by nigel nailing and the boat was very successfully lifted um so you know those are

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:58.280
probably his most um significant um finds that um you know in all um uh what is it four four

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:06.520
cases led to you know quite big excavations and published monographs um but there are quite a

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:14.680
number of others as well other other discoveries and as far as I know you know all his main

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:24.760
discoveries I think have been published actually um all because he generously shared his information

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:32.120
with other people you know he wasn't able to to write them up himself but he involved other people

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:38.520
and helped them you know launch a project that that investigated them

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:45.240
amazing isn't it that's what's said to collaboration yes it's quite it is quite unusual

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:52.440
because I think you know there are other you know quite gifted as it were amateur archaeologists

00:15:52.440 --> 00:16:00.680
that find a lot of stuff but some of them don't share it yes at all and it and it sort of dies

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:07.960
with them really which is a great shame um yes because of course Derek died young really and

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:16.840
in tragic circumstances so I mean in a way it's fortunate that that all this stuff was um you know

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:21.400
by that stage largely written up although I suppose there may well have been other things

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:31.400
that I don't know about that um that were were lost with him but so would you say um uh that

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:39.560
this sort of excavation it is is it would you say it's a new and emerging science

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:45.960
in this sort of wetland area or oh yes yes very much so I mean um at least when we started you

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:56.200
know um the intertidal archaeology well it um at gold cliff started in 1991 um but there had been

00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:07.080
some some work earlier in 1986 at usk mouth and a few other bits and pieces and at that time it was

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:13.240
pretty well completely well fairly fairly new although you know there've been some earlier

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:21.800
projects um in some cases one or two bits of work decades before not in the seven estuary but

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:28.840
but in other other parts of the uk um but they were very small scale and I think the potential

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:39.320
of intertidal archaeology um really has mainly been recognized as a result of the work that

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:47.800
went on in the seven estuary from the from the late the mid 1980s onwards really um because it's

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:53.960
not just a matter of you know one or two sites here and there they're they're all over the place

00:17:53.960 --> 00:18:00.600
yeah um and every time we go there we find something um partly because the seven estuary

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:08.200
is so incredibly unusual you know it's got this enormous tidal range um so the the sea goes out

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:17.240
for kilometers and um it's got a thick sediment sequence which has got you know sites of well

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:27.000
all dates really um buried within it so what why um why the the arrival why was so late in the day

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:36.360
this um becoming alert to the potential of this area um uh yes that's a good question isn't it

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.840
I don't I don't think there's an easy answer to it except that um

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:52.840
I would you know archaeologists were a bit um bit fixated on on dry land sites yeah um and

00:18:54.280 --> 00:19:01.720
in south wales I think very fixated actually on roman and medieval archaeology um you know the

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:09.320
prehistory of of that area which most of these sediments are prehistoric and the prehistory had

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:16.200
had been little worked on in fact even now we know far more about the prehistory of the

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:24.120
the wetland in the intertidal zone than we do about the dry land oh really um you know which is

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:29.800
which is extraordinary although actually the archaeology of the dry land has advanced a lot

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:37.640
since um in the last 20 or 30 years but even so I think we've got nothing like the level of

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:44.360
information about it that we've got from this narrow strip on the intertidal zone and that's

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:50.200
because that the the particular circumstance is being preserved in the silt yes that's right

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:57.400
because it's these sediments are wet all the time and they preserve wood structures and a lot of

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:03.800
environmental evidence yeah things like footprints not just human footprints but animal footprints

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:10.760
most dryland situations all the wooden posts and things you know that make up trackways or

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:20.200
or buildings they've um decayed away in a wetland context you find the wood preserved so um

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:27.240
so did you have to forgive me for saying this Martin but did you have to learn on the job

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:35.160
or is that something you know it seems is it quite niche this sort of archaeology yes it's it's it's

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:44.360
it is quite quite niche um but um and yes i mean i i did have to learn on the job and i was fortunate

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:52.280
in that i had um two um great advisors one was john coles who was the guy that

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:57.880
pioneered the wetland archaeology of the Somerset levels and probably the most

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:06.120
widely respected wetland archaeologist in the world and john coles actually died

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:13.480
in the autumn as well but so he was one of our advisors but my colleague john allen was the other

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:22.040
advisor on the sediment side and then we got people like derek and a great team of supervisors

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:34.120
that we were able to hire um who'd worked on things like um waterlogged um uh waterfront sites

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:40.760
in in london yeah i mean different sorts of sites but also with preserved woods so they've got

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:46.920
expertise in that field yeah um so we were able to put together a really good team actually

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:54.760
each of whom had you know knowledge in aspects of the problem and then gradually from that we built

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:01.480
it built the sort of um experience to to know how to deal with these sites

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:09.800
do you um i i often imagine that uh it must be really challenging because you only have small

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:14.360
windows in which to work don't you because of the time yes that's right i mean the sites i'm

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:22.520
working on at the moment are in the bed of the of the seven estuary between four and five meters

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:31.800
below ordnance datum yeah um and there you only have you only have about an hour and a half

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:40.520
oh my goodness that spring tides yeah those spring tides occur for um about four or five days

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:49.160
every month or in some cases every two weeks yeah um so they're tiny little windows and of course

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:54.360
sometimes especially at this time of year the the low tide falls in the middle of the night so you

00:22:54.440 --> 00:23:01.640
can't do anything yeah um and then there's a period from um about may till mid-august when

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:08.120
there are no suitable tides um at all because the tidal range is is low during the summer

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:17.000
so um i guess in the course of the year there are probably i actually never really counted it up

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:24.040
but you know there are going to be probably 20 days something like that that are really suitable

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:30.680
to work on sites like that and on those 20 days you've only got about an hour and a half in the

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:40.920
most critical um area so it's a matter of you know working very fast and um knowing exactly what

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:45.560
you're going to do on a particular tide so that you're building up an additive picture all the

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:51.000
time but is it possible that when you go back the following day it's been covered up again

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.120
oh yes it's always been covered up to some extent but i mean it might just be covered up by a thin

00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:03.880
film of mud yeah or sometimes it might be covered up by 10 or 20 centimeters of sand yeah which is

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:09.720
you know very difficult to shift if you've only got an hour and a half to uncover something

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:18.200
photograph it make a plan and record it but what tools do you use out there then sorry what tools

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:26.920
do you use tools um well a range of tools um i mean the main tool i use at the moment actually

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:35.960
is water to wash off things that are partly exposed so i'm out there with a as the tide goes down

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:43.320
yeah i'm out there with a bucket of water standing in the water filling up the bucket and chucking it

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:48.840
where there are little bits of interesting sediment exposed yeah and that way i can use

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:55.960
the sea to wash away some of the mud or sand that's accumulated and see whether there's

00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:03.240
anything significant there but we have to use plastic and wooden tools particularly because

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:11.640
other other tools damage the the wood um and so that's quite difficult do you have you ever

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:22.120
got caught out by the tide um well um not not seriously but you know there are times when um

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.360
when it comes in very quickly but i mean we're we're quite fortunate actually in the area where

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:39.960
we're working um there is a gentle slope from the site upwards so um uh although the tide comes in

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:49.160
very quickly at the bottom of the slope um once one's got to the the slope itself you know even

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:56.600
at a crawling pace one would be able to to move more quickly than the tide comes in so and it's

00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:04.520
it's not um as dangerous as as it might be but of course you've got to avoid areas of of quicksand

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:12.040
and deep mud oh my goodness are there many of those yes um but you know i've never got um

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:18.680
completely stuck and and and nobody that has been working with me has ever got completely stuck but

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:26.920
i mean it would be possible too and and i suppose if one was very cold and exhausted

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:33.800
you know that could be that could be difficult and of course it's not somewhere where you can

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:43.400
work on your own no you've always got somebody with you yes yes um so um do you know um

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:49.320
developments say like the the new um it's not new anymore the second seven bridge and

00:26:50.040 --> 00:27:00.760
once upon a time the proposed seven barrage and um it must shift the um the the the bed of the river

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:07.400
or the estuary did have you have you noticed the impact of those developments yes very very much

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:14.360
so yeah um i mean most of my work isn't isn't particularly near the the new seven bridge but

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:25.800
um just in in um when was it january i think of of of 2020 um i went down to see some sites that

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:36.280
were underneath the bridge where medieval um woven fish baskets in large numbers i mean 20 or more

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:47.160
had been exposed by erosion and the the the tremendous scouring around the um the giant

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:53.000
rectangular concrete pillars that support the the the box structure of the bridge

00:27:53.880 --> 00:28:01.400
um and it's exposing these fish traps medieval fish traps all the time um so there's there's a

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:09.400
lot of important stuff they're being exposed and and not really being recorded at the moment

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:17.000
although it has been worked on in the past in fact um rick turner who was the i think the main sort

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:23.480
of archaeological inspiration behind the living levels project he pioneered the study of um

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:31.320
fish baskets and other finds when the second seven crossing was was being made yeah um the other big

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:38.920
change that's happened as a result of the bridge is the build-up of sediment um which is sea wood

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:46.680
of the bridge as far as i can see where there's been quite a quite a development of a sediment

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:54.280
deposition so sites that were exposed before the bridge was built are now deeply buried by

00:28:54.920 --> 00:29:03.240
by mud so it's it's certainly caused um significant changes but then the other issue there is that

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:10.040
there are there are big changes in the behavior of the estuary going on anyway for all sorts of

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:18.600
that we don't fully understand but it's to do with the pattern of of weather and climate and

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:25.480
maybe the incidence of westerly winds and big storms so you get these well sort of cyclical

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:34.760
changes occurring um which affect what's exposed have you experienced that over the decades then

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:40.680
you've been working down there you've observed that yes yes and my colleague john allen um the

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:49.560
sediment specialist has actually documented these things going back um least three or four hundred

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:57.640
years oh really gosh so for you martin what what's been your most exciting discoveries

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:07.400
um well let's think well i would say the footprints actually although of course you know in a sense i

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:13.320
i share that discovery with derrick upton and and with others because different people have found

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:23.080
them in different places but um i've found a lot of uh of fine examples at gold cliff um and um

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:31.000
you know i think that's the thing that sort of captured people's imagination yes um most um

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:41.320
and i suppose the you know the discovery that of how much iron age um archaeology there was at

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:52.280
at gold cliff in the we've we've excavated eight rectangular buildings there and 16 trackways why

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:59.720
and but of course you know all these things are done by by a team of people really you know i had

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:08.200
i had about um i suppose about 40 people working with me at a time at gold cliff to

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:14.360
excavate those buildings and record all the stuff that derrick upton had originally found

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.560
so when you say trackway what do you mean what is a trackway is it a roadway well it's a laid

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:28.440
wood structure of various types i mean some of them are bits of round timber let's say

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:34.760
uh about a meter long all laid one next to another so that people could walk across

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:44.360
the salt marsh or the reed swamp um without sinking in others are bits of larger round timber

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:52.600
laid along the line of a trackway to create the same sort of effect and still others are

00:31:52.600 --> 00:32:01.240
much more sophisticated where you take some bits of round timber let's say 70 centimeters long with

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:08.440
a pointed end and you stick them in diagonally at 45 degrees to make a sort of cross piece

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:15.400
yeah and then you put either planks or brush wood across the top to make a raised walkway

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:25.480
that's probably where there's shallow water rather than than a than a muddy surface yeah um so there

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:32.200
are lots of those in in the estuary particularly at gold cliff but a few in other places as well

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:39.320
so i wonder why gold cliff and redwick seem to have a concentration is that because you've just

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:46.520
been digging there um no i think it's i think gold cliff it's i think the explanation is straight

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:53.880
forward really that there was an island there oh yeah an island of bedrock in the middle of

00:32:54.840 --> 00:33:03.560
okay um and that island was about one kilometer by half a kilometer yeah um and that provided

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:11.240
an ideal place for well exploiting the the resources of the estuary yeah probably

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:17.240
particularly fish but other resources as well what are the other resources then what were the

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:23.960
other resources yeah um well um probably birds although to be honest we haven't got very much

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:30.840
evidence of that but bird bones don't survive terribly well and later on in the iron age

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:39.640
and the bronze age actually the key resource was grazing animals on the salt marsh so that's what

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:48.600
rectangular buildings that gold cliff and redwood were to do with grazing cattle and sheep because

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:56.760
it was very rich nutritionally yes exactly and and really good pasture seasonally you know it

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:02.520
wouldn't have been much use in the winter yeah because it would be terribly terribly wet and

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:09.080
and um you know big difficulty with animals getting stuck and so on but there's a period from

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:16.600
about may until the middle of august when the tidal range is reduced and the salt marsh plants

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:23.640
are really you know coming into their own and very very productive and that i think is when

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:29.560
people would have been grazing their animals down there and the same thing went on in salt marsh

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:38.680
environments into into recent times actually oh really um you know it was a it still is used as

00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:45.880
a grazing resource where it survives but actually there's very little proper salt marsh surviving in

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:53.480
the seven estuary now it's quite restricted where would you find find it today then at peterson

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:59.800
okay um there's there's a reasonable area at peterson actually although it's not it's

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:08.040
it's grazing is is not well um i suppose i better not pass any comment on the grazing

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.560
some of it seems to involve horses and things right okay yeah i'm not clear that it's that

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:21.720
it's really managed in a traditional way and there's there are issues about the ownership of it

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:30.200
at gold cliff there's a triangle of salt marsh beside gold cliff hill which i think is still

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:39.480
grazed by by sheep um and um you know that's probably grazed in a in a fairly traditional

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:46.440
sort of way so has to sort wash be been washed away then over the decades yes that's the problem

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:53.080
you see once the sea wall becomes established yeah um as i mean there's probably been some sort of

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:59.720
sea wall in much of the seven estuary since the roman period but certainly by medieval times

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:08.120
sea walls were were sort of fixed yeah and so what happens then is you get the erosion of the

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:15.800
salt marsh on the seaward side of the sea wall yeah um but but the the salt marsh can't sort of

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:21.800
retreat inland of course because the sea walls there okay yeah you've got a constantly diminishing

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:31.000
salt marsh so at times in the mesolithic or the iron age um salt marsh probably extended right

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:39.400
from the present sea wall um to the to the rising ground you know let's say flanworm or somewhere

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:47.080
you know you could have had around six kilometers wow not all salt marsh perhaps i mean it would

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:55.480
have been a mixture of salt marsh mud flats yeah um raised bog in places and thin woodland yeah

00:36:55.480 --> 00:37:03.000
but those are all you know really important wildlife habitats yeah um and now um what you've

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:11.880
got is a well the salt marsh is largely gone except at places like peterson and and gold cliff

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:20.280
um and and i think that near a cardiff there's some there's some salt marsh remaining um and

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:26.840
the other environments of course have largely vanished as well apart from mud flats which are

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:34.920
which are still extensive at low tide but um so you often when when you know

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:40.760
reads about the the the levels you often hear about you know the land being reclaimed and

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:48.280
habitated and you know it's been described to me as a you know monumental civil engineering

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:55.960
project really so what you're seeing in your early history archaeology are you seeing examples of

00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:05.240
land reclamation or is it just farming with what seeing do you see what um what i'm mostly seeing

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:11.640
in the bronze age and iron age and perhaps in the neolithic but less evidence for the neolithic

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:17.800
is people utilizing a landscape um in order to

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:28.520
obtain grazing um and and particular resources yeah fish and and so on and all the other wetland

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:34.200
resources that would be useful you know like reeds and yeah and so on all the plants that they would

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:43.400
have would have used they're not in up until the roman period altering the landscape in a deliberate

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:50.520
way okay and so we don't find evidence of drainage and reclamation yeah until the roman period i

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:55.800
would say i mean some people have argued otherwise but i don't think the evidence for that is at all

00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:04.680
good actually um in the roman period we certainly do get um evidence for the making of low banks

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:11.560
to keep the sea out yeah and we've got that at gold cliff and making of ditches to drain

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:17.960
areas which were probably behind low banks or sea walls and you've got that

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:33.240
um very clearly at gold cliff at nash in the sewage works um and in rumney um on the um the

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:44.600
went loop level um uh lots of evidence for roman activity and the same thing over on the english

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:53.960
side actually yeah so i think the romans drained the levels without any doubt i think they also

00:39:53.960 --> 00:40:01.800
protected some of it from the sea with with a probably a rather low sea wall that probably

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:11.080
didn't keep out all the um all the all every tide but that kept most of them out and and and

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:16.760
probably all of them out for the period of the summer when most of the the area would have been

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:23.320
most intensively used but by the roman period we know that people were actually living on the wetland

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:29.800
because there's traces of settlements and buildings and wells and things i mean steve

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:34.920
ripon will be able to tell you a lot more about that because that is that's his subject and not

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:44.600
really mine okay so what would you say your um what is yours ancient history iron age no my

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:52.760
my subject is is is environmental archaeology and geoarchaeology okay pre-history i suppose really

00:40:52.760 --> 00:41:01.320
so what does that mean then martin um well the period that i specialize in is is up to but not

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:07.000
including the roman period really okay okay but because i'm an environmental archaeologist

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:14.840
i'm interested in people's relationship with the with the landscape and how people have changed

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:21.480
the landscape okay um and the the sediments as well you know that's that's part of it the sediments

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:29.160
the vegetation the evidence for plants and animals so that side and that's you know in a way why i'm

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:36.760
so uh passionate about the living levels because it helps to bring together the archaeology the

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:45.080
heritage and the the nature really so in in the evidence you've gathered and and excavated how

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:55.720
have you seen people change in the landscape um well um if it's not so much how in the periods

00:41:55.720 --> 00:42:00.600
that i'm dealing with in the seven estuary not so much how people are changing the landscape

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:10.520
except by using it yeah um it's more about how they're fitting in okay a changing landscape yeah

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:20.200
and taking advantage of the opportunities that that it provides um so they will have been changing

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:27.560
the landscape i mean for instance in the bronze age there are so many footprints of cattle on the

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:33.960
peat surface in the entire zone yeah but it's obvious that it was a really significant grazing

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:39.640
resource yeah i would argue probably just for part of the year you know three or four months probably

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:46.920
and and the the that grazing would have had a significant impact on the vegetation yeah um

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:54.200
um we we know that when salt marsh and it's grazed today that it that it has a different

00:42:54.200 --> 00:43:01.720
vegetation composition from you know untouched salt marsh as it were so their their activities

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:09.160
are changing it in that way but it's not like the the sort of much larger scale um all deliberate

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:16.600
alteration of the landscape by the creation of of things like fields and and so on that you get

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:25.960
in a dryland situation it's more people utilizing resources um in the in a constantly changing

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:34.200
coastal situation so it it sounds to me like it could keep on giving this this area oh yes i think

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:42.200
so i mean it's you know it's eroding all the time and what's more the sand and the silt is moving

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:51.720
around all the time so you know there will be things exposed at the next low tide yeah that

00:43:51.720 --> 00:44:00.920
have probably never been never been seen before um the trouble is of course you know will one be

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:12.360
there to record it and um and i suppose you know it's um perfectly valid criticism in a way that

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:21.880
my research has inevitably especially over the last five or so years been very much focused at

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:25.320
um

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:32.520
i didn't didn't mention this previously but one of the the uh the most exciting things we've found is

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:40.600
a is a wooden fish trap of mesolithic date the only example that's ever been found in um the

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:45.960
british isles except for a couple of examples in ireland actually goodness me so how old is that

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:53.880
then would you say um it's um about 7 000 years that's extraordinary and it's right down in the

00:44:53.880 --> 00:45:01.160
bed of the estuary the lowest site we've ever found wow and that makes it particularly difficult

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:12.600
because it's um you know it's got the the shortest time of exposure gosh so was it was it recognizably

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:23.480
a fish trap i mean well yes i mean it's actually a series of v-shaped um lines of well wooden posts

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:30.680
making a v-shape yeah only about four or five meters long by two and a half meters wide yeah

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:38.840
um and um woven around these posts the posts are about four centimeters in diameter i suppose

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:47.480
there are little thin um bits of um round wood which are sort of woven around to make a basket

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:51.560
yeah so it's um yes i think i would say it's quite recognizable

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:58.920
god the fish trap and that was a totally unexpected discovery three years ago yeah when we were doing

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:08.520
a drone survey to try and make a plan of our human footprints yeah and to to to make this plan we had

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:18.040
to put down a series of 12 targets which were like well like big crosses on on them on plastic

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:24.360
yeah in order to enable the drone to match up hundreds of photographs that it took

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:31.160
in order to make a sort of composite plan and one of these targets was put down somewhere where

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:36.760
we'd never looked before yeah and my colleague tom walker who's worked with me on all this for

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:43.800
for several years realized that there was a line of wooden posts there wow yeah we thought well

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:49.400
that's interesting but we expected they would turn out to be medieval actually yeah and then

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:56.280
we got a radiocarbon date and and we've now dated i think six of them and all of them are

00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:03.320
metalic that's extraordinary very exciting yes it is it is yeah i suppose in recent years that's

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:10.520
the most exciting discovery really so the use of drones have been very useful for you yes i mean

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:17.000
yes transformative in that case because actually without the drone it was impossible to make a

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:24.680
proper plan yeah you know when you've only got um an hour and a half at a tide yeah and the area

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:31.400
that you're dealing with is you know um well the core survey area for the footprints is

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:39.480
is about 800 meters by 200 meters yeah and it's very complex you know there are lots of different

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:47.960
sediments exposed with footprints in some of them and then other moving banks of gravel and sand

00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:55.560
and so on burying everything sometimes you know getting a proper plan was only possible with this

00:47:55.640 --> 00:48:02.280
drone but then you know there was this amazing spin-off really but i may be um

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:14.760
sounding ignorant here but do you use lidar at all yes not um not in the seven estuary

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:21.400
intertidal zone okay and actually partly because of course the trouble with the tides okay yes

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:29.400
you know you're very lucky if you've got got some your lidar pictures taken at the right time

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:38.120
right okay yeah you know the um the tide's got to be out yeah um so i use lidar quite a lot in

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:47.480
dryland situations but i've never actually found um an existing lidar data set um that um

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:54.280
um you know had been taken at the appropriate time for the area that i'm working in the seven

00:48:54.280 --> 00:49:01.320
estuary although of course if it was flown specifically for that which is expensive yes

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:07.720
you know one could get that and it would be incredibly valuable are you surprised at how

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:14.840
much interest your work and your team's work and its discoveries have um attracted

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:22.040
a wide generation yes i would i would say so i mean we've had lots of um you know interest from

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:28.760
the general public you know the lectures that have been organized by the the living levels have been

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:36.520
very well attended by local people um and then there's been quite a lot of interest from

00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:43.240
over the years from television programs and so on i think we've had i don't know i've never

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:51.400
counted them 15 television programs that have that have come to film particularly the footprints

00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:57.480
um well they're so relatable aren't they the footprints yes exactly i think they capture

00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:05.000
people's imagination and of course that's good from our point of view not only does it make them

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:12.440
the work that we're doing more widely known but it also provides a you know another form of record

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:20.680
actually yes you know there's our academic photographs and plans and notes and reports but

00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:28.520
you know a bit of television uh footage is is um you know in some ways more more accessible to

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:35.560
to to the average person so is the work ongoing do you think the archaeological work ongoing down

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:43.720
yes yes it's ongoing at the moment in a in a pretty modest way yeah i mean largely myself

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:52.120
and and tom walker um when we haven't got lockdowns we visit um i don't know six to eight

00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:58.920
times a year when there's a suitable low tide and we record what's exposed yeah and we've got quite

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:06.760
shopping list of other things that we want to do oh yes some of which we're you know gradually

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:13.800
getting on with others will depend more on on trying to raise a grant from somewhere oh my god

00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:21.880
and that is difficult actually oh gosh yeah in the present in the present climate i had one

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:28.520
grant application that would have enabled me to do everything i wanted to complete there yeah

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:35.720
and it was two days away from submission to the national geographic society in america yeah when

00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:43.160
they pulled the entire grant round because of covid oh my goodness really and they still haven't

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:54.200
reinstated it so um that was a tremendous blow really oh gosh huge blow yes god do you do you

00:51:54.200 --> 00:52:02.280
attract international interest then in your work yes we we've had um we had a a good coverage in

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:09.080
the national geographic in the past oh have you really yeah two photographers yeah and from

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:16.760
from new york to work with us for a week when was that then martin um that was i can't remember

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:25.880
um probably about um six years ago six or eight years ago yeah um and a journalist

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:34.520
from switzerland also came from them to write a write an account of what was going on so

00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:42.280
there's been that that interest and quite a lot of international interest from archaeologists

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:50.840
yeah what from archaeologists who work in similar environment yes particularly i think yes

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:54.760
yes because the techniques we're using and the types of things we're finding are

00:52:55.480 --> 00:53:02.200
relevant to them and the great growth in coastal and intertidal archaeology in britain

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:11.080
has been um mirrored in you know many other parts of the world actually yeah so we've

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:19.080
you know we benefited from collaboration and advice with colleagues in denmark and scandinavia

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:26.360
the nevelands north germany um canada and and america in particular but other places as well

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:32.360
yeah well martin i'm very conscious of the time i i've been talking for now and then i don't want

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:39.560
to keep you too long but um i wonder if i had any more questions i could add them to the transcription

00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:45.160
when i send it through yes of course yes would that be okay i'll pop the answers onto onto that

00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:51.320
that's that's lovely it's happy to help in any way i can thank you so much it's been so nice to chat

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:57.480
and thank you so much for putting up with me in my uh ignorant questions but they weren't at all

00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:03.320
ignorant actually i think they were you know it seemed very pertinent well i hope so i mean it's

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:08.920
so fascinating you know it's something it's so tangible when you say you find a fishing net that

00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:15.800
or trap that is you know several thousand years old it's just it just sparks the imagination i

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:20.760
mean do you do that when you find something like that do you try to imagine what the lives were

00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:27.800
like are the people who made it and put it there yes yes yes that's uh that's half the fun of it

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:32.920
really and it's certainly very exciting for us really to you know never quite know what you're

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:38.920
going to find you know usually something interesting turns up and a huge benefit of

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:45.880
working in the same area for decades really because the picture builds up all the time you know

00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:53.480
yeah it's not as if you're duplicating what you already know it's as there's often completely new

00:54:53.480 --> 00:55:00.920
things oh it's so exciting but martin thank you so much your time i am really grateful

00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:08.520
good luck with the completion of your thank you well this is actually um i'm doing a short book

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:17.080
so um this is what i'm working on now um so um this will appear in the book at some points

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:22.120
probably next year i should love that's terrific i mean it's i think it's very good that you're

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:29.000
providing some permanent record like that actually because i think so that's these lottery projects

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:36.600
they can be um you know a bit difficult from that point of view once they end you know

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:45.800
that's it wondering what the what the legacy yeah and you know it's um yes everything's going

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:53.960
to record office but not everyone um uses archives it's and that's what i was keen that those who

00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:59.560
don't normally maybe wouldn't access heritage or culture like that maybe they would through a book

00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:06.520
so it's really good the project management have agreed to that now and yeah thank you so much

00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:14.760
martin fine happy to help in any way i can oh lovely you take care now yeah thank you bye
