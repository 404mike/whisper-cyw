WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Felly, gallwch chi ddweud i mi eich angen, eich adres a'i ddau i'r beth, i chi?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Ydw i, mae'n Janet Taylor a fi wedi bod yn 2012, yn 41.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Felly, dweud i mi ychydig am eich ymddygiad yna, y lle ydych chi wedi bod yn nifer, eich fater, eich mwyaf, hynny, beth yw'r hyn yma,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
a'r hyn y maen nhw'n ei wneud i'r ddau, eich syblings.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Wel, mae'r maen nhw'n gweithio mewn gwasanaeth, yw, ychydig yn ychydig, pan oedd hi'n cael fy modd.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Mae'r tair yn gweithio mewn steilau cyfrannol, a fi wedi bod yn ymddygiad ym Mardie, ym Mardie.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Dyna oherwydd bod i wedi bod yn ymddygiad pan y Blitz wedi bod yn ymddygiad ac roeddwn ni wedi gwneud rhan o ffamlwyr ymddygiad,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
felly mae'n fwyaf o bobl wedi bod yn ymddygiad ac mae gen i unrhyw ffrindiau sydd yn 67.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Felly mae'r ffrindiau nid yn ati allan yn ym Mardie, ond yn dda i fod yn ymddygiad iawn i ni.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Felly pan oeddwn i'n ddwy mwyaf oed, roedd hi'n dod yn ymddygiad i'r Grangetown, felly rwy'n ymddygiad o'r Grangetown.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Rydyn ni'n byw yn y ddau oedd fy nghyfan.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Roedd hi'n oed fel llawer o bobl eraill, roedd hi'n ddwyfn.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Roedd gennym ddwyfn a'r nghyfan oedd yn byw yn y chwyciant, a rydyn ni'n byw yn y rhan cydnod.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Ond pan mae'r ddau oedd fy marn i'n mynd i'r gwedd, roedd hi a'i ffrindiau yn y rhan cydnod, fel llawer o ffamlwyr eraill.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Ond roedd gennym ddwy ffrindiau yn y ffermwter yn 1952, pan roedd y ffermwter wedi'i ddod oes ar y ddau.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Ond roedd gennym y ffermwter yn y ffermwter, 58 mlynedd, pan roedd fy marn i'n ddod 4 mlynedd yw, a roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ddau i gyd.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Felly roedd gennym ddwy ffrindiau oedd yn y ddau oedd gennych chi'n mynd i'r ddau, ymlaen, a'r ddau.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Roedd y ddau yma'n grangysg. Pan oeddwn i'n mynd i'r ffermwter, roeddwn i'n mynd i Herba Thomson yn Ily, ar 12 mlynedd, roedd hynny yn 1952, 53.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Roeddwn i'n mynd i'r Ysgol Gwraig, y Gadellfa Gwyddoedd Caerdydd i'r ddau, pan oeddwn i'n 16, roeddwn i'n mynd i'r 17, yn y ddau.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ddau yna, a dyna pan roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ddau.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Yn y ddau, beth yw'n ei wneud?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ddau yna.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ddau yna, felly roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ddau yn unig.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Felly roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ddau yn unig?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Nid, nid.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Felly beth ydych chi'n dechrau i'w wneud pan oeddwch chi'n mynd i'r ddau?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Felly, ym mhob, roeddwn i'n gweithio yn y Llyfrgell Genedlaethol ar gyfer 11 weiciau,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
ond roeddwn i'n gweithio yn y lab.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Ond pan roeddwn i'n gweithio yno, roeddwn i'n mynd i'r Cymru technol a'i wneud,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
roedd yn ddau'r cyfleoedd, cyfrifiadau cyfrifiadau cymhestriol.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Felly, dyna'r ffordd y byddaf i'n mynd, roedd yn y cyfleoedd cyfrifiadol unig,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
dydw i ddim yn mynd i'r ddau.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Wel, roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ddau, ond rwy'n mynd i'r ddau,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
ond roeddwn i'n ddwy i'r ddau yn y ddau.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Mae gennych chi unrhyw cyfrifiadau i'r lab?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Ie, roeddwn i'n gweithio cymhestriol, cyfrifiadau cymhestriol a biologi a mathau.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Mae'r ddau anglais a'r Ffrenc a'r biolog.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Roeddwn i'n gweithio ar y ddau.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Felly roeddwn i'n gweithio ar y ddau?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Roeddwn i'n gweithio ar y ddau yn yr ysgol ym Mhryd.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Felly, ddweud i mi yna, sut ydych chi'n cael y gweithio?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Roeddwn i'n gweithio ar unrhyw ddau?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Yn y Stilwerth.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Ie.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Roeddwn i'n cwybod i ffrindiau am hynny y ddau.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Roeddwn i'n gweithio ar y ffrindiau, a oedd y cymhestriol, rwy'n credu, yn ymwneud â'r lab.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Roedd yn fwy fwyaf man, a roedd yn dweud i mi,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Felly, byddwch chi'n gwybod i ddweud yma i weithio, byddwch chi'n gwybod,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
pan dweud, oh, yw, byddwch chi'n gwybod i weithio yn y lab.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
O.C. roedd yn dweud, yw, roedd yn dweud, yw,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
roedd yn dweud, yw, roedd yn dweud, yw,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
pobl estref?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.360
Mae

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.000
Gade satisfactory.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Felawn casgliad.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Mae'r benoriaeth i Sir Acton i hynys?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Marks.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.720
�v hitar ta fydd y gallai hynny dweud

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.560
Sir hefyd,

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.520
a dyd y sandwich yn cyffrous Iddyn nhw'n Freundellaf yn alwn

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.180
ar gyfer血 wleidlogG

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:55.180
oherwydd roedd yna lab ymddygiadol, yn fawr, ac roedd y gynnydd o ffyrdd gwahanol o'r ffyrdd gwahanol sydd yma yng Nghymru,

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:05.180
fel ffyrdd manganes a phethau hynny. Felly, mae pobl yn ddweud i chi ddod i wneud, a byddwch chi'n gweithio gyda phan am ddod,

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:15.180
ac yna byddwch chi'n dweud ar eich hun, ac roedd hynny'n dda iawn yn dda iawn. Ond dwi ddim yn anegu rhywbeth yn cael ei ddod.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.180
Mae wedi bod. Rydw i'n rhaid i ffrindio rhywbeth.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.180
Felly, oeddech chi'n gwybod unrhyw un o'r bobl yn y gwaith yma?

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.180
Oeddech chi'n gwybod unrhyw un o'r bobl yn y gwaith yma?

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.180
Nid yn y lab. Rydw i'n gwybod ymlaen o'r ffrindiau ysgol yn gweithio mewn gwaith ystafffyr.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.180
A roeddwn i'n cysylltu â hi'r ddiwedd.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:40.180
Roeddwn i'n gwybod yna yn y lab, ond roeddwn i ddim gwybod unrhyw un yn y lab.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:47.180
Ond roeddwn i'n gwybod, roedd nhw'n dda iawn o bobl iawn. Mae'n dda.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.180
Felly, roedd hynny'n...

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.180
Dylw i beth y byddai'n cael ei ddod, a beth yma'n cael ei ddod yna?

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.180
Felly roedd yna Gaskin a Nettelfolds.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.180
Dwi ddim yn credu bod nhw'n gwneud y stil yna.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.180
Dwi'n credu bod hi'n cael ei ddod o...

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.180
Beth?

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.180
Roedd ganddo GKIS.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.180
Yn ystafffyr, yna...

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.180
Felly, a oes yn ddigwyddodd ym Mhynnystd?

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.180
Roedd yn y gwaith ym nesaf iawn,

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.180
felly, rwy'n credu, roedd wedi bod yn Richard Thomas a Baldwin yn unrhyw amser.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.180
Ond roeddai'n cael ei roi'r steil yn y Gaskin,

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.180
ac roedd yna ffatri nesaf a'r gwyb ac yn dda fel hynny.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:36.180
Felly, fe ddodd nhw'n ymwneud y steil yno.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.180
Fe ddodd nhw'n ymwneud y proses steilmach.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:49.820
Ond roedd ymdrech yn dda iawn i weithio, oherwydd yna traenau i'w gyrraedd,

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:56.020
oherwydd, ymdrech, ymddirieddio'r blynyddoedd a'i ddod yn y lles ymlaen,

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:04.100
a'ch chi'n cael ei ffwrdd pan ydych chi'n mynd yn y lab, oherwydd ydych chi'n mynd yn y lles,

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:10.100
a'r hyn yn y lles, ond rwy'n credu bod yna'r un peth o'r lleiaf,

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:18.100
os ydych chi'n gweithio gyda phobl, gallwch chi gydweud hynny, ac roeddwn i'n mynd i'n ffwrdd, rwy'n dechrau.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.100
Felly, ddweud i mi am eich dydd cyntaf, a oes gennych chi'n gwybod eich dydd cyntaf,

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.100
a'r hyn yn mynd i mewn, a beth mae'n teimlo fel hyn?

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.100
Nid, dwi ddim yn gallu'n gwybod hynny.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:32.100
Roeddwn i'n bwysig iawn, rwy'n dechrau, ond roedd yn ffwrdd,

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.100
a oedd yna ddwy o'r ddau yna sy'n fy nghymdeithas.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:43.100
Rwy'n meddwl bod yn ddiddorol y byddai'r ddau eraill wedi'i gwneud ymchwil.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.100
Rwy'n gwybod y byddai'r un ddau ddim oherwydd roedd hi'n dweud.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.100
Roedd yna ddau oherwydd y byddai'r ddau sy'n mynd i mewn i'r cymdeithas.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:27.100
Rwy'n meddwl bod yna rhan o'i gweithredu, oherwydd roedd hi'n gweithredu i fynd.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.100
Dyna yw hynny.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:34.100
Roedd yna, ac roeddwn i'n mynd yno, a dwi ddim yn gwybod beth oedd yn digwydd yn dda,

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.100
ond y ddau ddim yn gweithredu i fynd.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.100
Ond roeddwn i'n meddwl amdano am hynny'r ddau y ddau,

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:48.100
a dwi'n meddwl, roeddwn i'n meddwl y bobl oedd angen i'n mynd oherwydd,

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:54.100
fel ymchwil, ond y ddau ddau wedi'i gweithredu, yn bwysig,

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:59.100
ac nid oedd yn ymchwil i'n mynd i'r hynny.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.100
A dwi'n meddwl, oh, yw hynny'n rhan o'r hynny.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:08.100
Ond nid oedd o'n oed i mi oedd o'r hynny.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.100
Ond roedd yn ffordd, roedd yn ymchwil,

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.100
a roedd yn rhan o'r hynny.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.100
Ond roedd yn ymchwil.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:25.100
Roedd yn ymchwil.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.100
Roedd yn ymchwil.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:31.100
Roedd yn ymchwil.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.100
Roedd yn ymchwil.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.100
How big was the lab to start off?

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.100
How many people worked there altogether?

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.100
There were quite a few who worked there.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.100
There must have been six or eight girls who worked there,

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:51.100
and because they also had what they called a micro room,

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.100
because it was all done by, it was microscope work,

00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:01.100
and they were all, the lads that worked in the air were doing metallurgy,

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.100
and I think they were following a metallurgy course,

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.100
but there were quite a few lads worked in the lab,

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.100
in the part where I was as well.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.100
There must have been about four of them,

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:18.100
and sometimes you get a couple more come in and things like that.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:25.100
But I can actually remember one of the lads saying once,

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:29.100
because it was all very routine analysis,

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.100
and there was lots of it.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.100
You could have 60 samples to analyse,

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:38.100
get it done by 11 o'clock, because then another lot would come in then.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:43.100
Somebody must have said to one of these chaps,

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:47.100
well, come and give us a hand, or you could do that.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:52.100
He said, I don't do routine analysis, I go to tech.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:56.100
I'm doing a college course sort of thing.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:02.100
When I think about it, I thought, yes, we were just there to do all the donkey work, really.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.100
But mind, there was one lady there.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.100
She was a bit older than me.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:11.100
She'd been to Cardiff High School as well, and she didn't.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:17.100
There was a chap responsible for the analytical side of the lab,

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:24.100
and she worked to him, and I think she had a degree, and he did as well.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:29.100
But the rest of it was all just pretty routine stuff.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:33.100
So take me through a day's work then.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.100
What did you do from...

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:40.100
Well, okay, when did you go in in the morning to begin with?

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:44.100
Oh, we had to be there by nine o'clock.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:50.100
They used to have works buses picked us up at the General Station,

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:54.100
and took us straight to the gates.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:59.100
Were those free? Were they paid for by the company?

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:03.100
Yes, I think they were free, if I remember rightly.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:10.100
Then all the office staff would be on them, everybody.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:14.100
Then you used to have to clock in.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:19.100
They had special clock-in-in sheds, and it was the old-fashioned.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:25.100
You had a card that you'd ping and put it in the right slot.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:31.100
If you clocked the wrong card, you could be sacked.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.100
It was a lot different then.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.100
I clocked the wrong card one day.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:41.100
Somebody had put their card in my slot by mistake.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:45.100
I got over to the lab and I said,

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.100
I don't know what to do, I've done this.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.100
They said, ring Wages Department and tell them now.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.100
That's all I did.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.100
I said, look, I'm sorry.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.100
Was that bad?

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.100
Yes.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:03.100
One of the girls that worked in the little office attached to the lab,

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.100
she had the sack for being late.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:11.100
She was not a good timekeeper, I must admit.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.100
She had trouble getting up in the mornings.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.100
They wrote to her once and said if it happened again,

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.100
she would have to finish.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:23.100
She just couldn't get out of bed in the mornings.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.100
They sacked her.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.100
Things were very strict then.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.100
Not different from today.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.100
No flexy time then.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.100
You started at nine then?

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.100
Yes, finished at five.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.100
How many breaks did you have during the day?

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.100
We used to stop for lunch.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.100
We used to make coffee in the lab.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:50.100
We didn't go over to the canteen for a break.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:55.100
We didn't have time because there was too much going on.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:14:01.100
You were having to finish one lot of analyses before the next lot of steel samples came up.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:06.100
People would make coffee or tea in the lab.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:11.100
We went over to the canteen for lunch.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:16.100
I think there were about four canteens in Nettlefold.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:20.100
There was a canteen for the workers, one for the staff,

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:24.100
one for the monthly paid staff and one for the directors.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:31.100
They improved as you went up the ladder.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:37.100
So if you were mentally paid you were higher up the food chain?

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:41.100
Yes, it was strange.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.100
What was the canteen like?

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.100
It wasn't too bad.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:50.100
On Fridays they used to do place and chips and that place was very nice.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.100
I always remember that.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:58.100
A bit like school dinners, the puddings were always nice.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:02.100
Bread and butter pudding and all that sort of thing.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.100
Steamed pudding and custard.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:10.100
All the old fashioned puddings that we all used to like.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.100
Did you eat in the canteen often?

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.100
I used to go there every day.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.100
Was it reasonable?

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:24.100
Yes, it was subsidised.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:32.100
We used to work Saturday mornings when I first started there.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:39.100
You used to get one Saturday morning off in three.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.100
That was a bit of a bind.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.100
How many hours a week did you work then?

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:51.100
Eight to five.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:16:01.100
Nine to five, five days a week and then nine to twelve on Saturday.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:05.100
I'd say eight hours a day.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:08.100
Did you have an hour for lunch?

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.100
Yes.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.100
They probably didn't count that.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.100
No, probably.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.100
So that's 38 hours then.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.100
Yes.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.100
What about afternoon break?

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:23.100
We just made something in the lab again.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:31.100
Take me through work then.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.100
What would you do?

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.100
You said you had these samples coming in.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.100
Yes, they used to bring those up from...

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:44.100
There was a part of the lab downstairs where they prepared the steel samples.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.100
Because it wouldn't be big lumps of steel.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:52.100
They used to mill, shave it, like shavings off it.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:58.100
The first thing to do was weigh out all these different samples.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.100
Very often they'd be 60.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:04.100
The balances we had were not electronic.

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:08.100
They were the old fashioned swing balances.

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:11.100
Some people had it off to a fine art.

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.100
They were really quick.

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:18.100
Then you'd go through the whole process of the analysis.

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.100
Get the results and everything.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:25.100
There were a couple of people employed there.

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:28.100
They used to wash up all the apparatus.

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:32.100
Then at 11 o'clock usually another lot came in.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.100
We'd started all again.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.100
Then you'd get another lot in the afternoon.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.100
It was quite busy.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.100
Some days were worse than others.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:53.100
I can remember somebody saying once that there was a problem with one of the samples that we had analysed.

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:59.100
Very often we'd have to go back and do it again and check it and make sure.

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:04.100
This one sample, we said, it's exactly the same as it was before.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.100
Oh, crumbs.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.100
The ship's on its way to Malaya.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.100
Things like that.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.100
Which we all thought was a hoot.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:16.100
So what were you analysing for?

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:24.100
We used to do phosphorus, manganese, silicon, carbon, sulphur.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:28.100
I'm sure there were a few others I've missed out.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.100
Lead.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.100
We used to do quite a few different things.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.100
Quite a few elements you should be looking for.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:44.100
Different types of steel have different specifications of the elements that have to be in them.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:48.100
We used to do, and it's the one thing I always remember.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:53.100
We used to analyse one steel called GK60.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.100
That was concrete reinforcing rods.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:02.100
Whenever I see a building going up with concrete rods, I think, I wonder if that's GK60.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.100
Not anymore, I shouldn't think.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:11.100
But you didn't, they weren't making the steel, so you were analysing somebody else's steel?

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:15.100
Yes, it was what they were actually sending out.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:23.100
They didn't actually make it there, so whether they ever added any elements,

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:31.100
because it would be hot in the furnaces, I suppose, when they rolled it.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:36.100
So whether they ever added any elements there, I don't know.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:41.100
You know, sort of things like manganese and all the rest of it, I'm not sure.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:49.100
Or do you think they were maybe as well providing a service for the place that made the steel?

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:53.100
Yes, perhaps, yeah. I'm not really sure.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:57.100
Because you didn't make it, I was wondering why.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.100
I don't think they made it there.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:08.100
I've got a friend's son who works, well, of course it comes under Salson now, it's a Spanish company.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:12.100
But I could easily ask Rita's husband worked there.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:17.100
He worked downstairs, I talked to him the other night about it.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:24.100
So how did you hear about the work, by the way? Why did you go for a job there specifically?

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:31.100
Because of my friend in staff wages, she said to me, there's a job coming up in the lab.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:35.100
So that was how we went there.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:40.100
What did you have to wear in the lab?

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:46.100
We used to wear white coats. It was so hot there.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:51.100
We used to strip off to our underwear and put the white coats on,

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.100
but very often they were covered in holes anyway.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:58.100
So we used to wrap them around, and hide the holes.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:03.100
We didn't wear stockings because you'd drop acid on them.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:11.100
So we all wore sand draws, flip-flops sandals, those sort of things, barefoot, bare legs.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:17.100
We used to go across to the canteen like that, even when there was snow on the ground.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.100
No wonder we all had bad bags.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:26.100
So you'd splash acid on your legs rather than your stockings?

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.100
Yeah, we'd wear them quite long.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:33.100
Because you'd wash it off your legs.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:43.100
I think we didn't take the overalls home to wash. They were done by GKN.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.100
So were they provided by GKN?

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.100
Yes.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:50.100
Were they cotton or were they nylon?

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.100
They were cotton, thick cotton.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.100
Which was better in the beginning.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:22:01.100
Yes, because with the heat in there, nylon would have been awful.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.100
Why was it so hot in there?

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:11.100
What they had there was four huge hot plates.

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:14.100
There were two back-to-back.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:20.100
They were in the middle of the lab and there were extractive fans above them.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.100
It really did get very hot.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.100
So you had to heat?

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:33.100
Yes. What we used to do, for I think nearly most of the analyses,

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.100
you dissolved the steel in acid first.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:43.100
Then that's when you could add all the different chemicals

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:48.100
to show up whatever you were looking for.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:57.100
If you did manganese, it was all done by colour spectrometry then.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:02.100
I think manganese was a sort of purpley colour as well, as I remember.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:08.100
We had instruments that would read the colour.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:14.100
We did do a couple of analyses that were carbon and sulphur,

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:19.100
where you burned the steel in a little furnace.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:23.100
You'd put it in little boats.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.100
With the carbon one, the carbon would burn off.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:30.100
They'd be passing oxygen over it, so you'd get carbon dioxide,

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:35.100
which would then get dried through, I think it was sulphuric acid,

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:40.100
into, I can't remember what the blooming stuff was,

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:44.100
it used to get absorbed into.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.100
You would weigh these, and that's what I'm doing there,

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:57.100
you would weigh these things to find out how much carbon the steel contained.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.100
That's what you're doing in the photograph?

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:03.100
Yes, I was doing that there.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:10.100
Apart from these overalls, cotton, were you given any protective clothing?

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:14.100
Rubber gloves.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:18.100
I'd get dermatitis from rubber gloves.

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.100
I had it really bad when I was there.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:25.100
I didn't know I was going to get the problem.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:31.100
They were rubber gloves, and you can get them with a flock lining now.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.100
They weren't like that.

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.100
They were just rubber.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.100
Oh, god, it was all...

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:40.100
Oh, excuse me.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.100
So you were saying about the rubber gloves?

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.100
Yes.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.100
Well, it's a common problem.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.100
Lots of people get it.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:54.100
My mother always had a problem, and my dad and my brother does as well.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:59.100
So I bought some white cotton gloves in boots of chemists,

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.100
and I used to put them inside.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:06.100
Otherwise, I'd have had to give it up, because it was quite bad.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:09.100
What about masks or anything?

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.100
Were you protected from fumes?

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:12.100
No.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.100
Were the fumes coming off the...

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:19.100
Yes, but because you put these samples on a hot plate

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.100
that was underneath an extractor fan,

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:25.100
the fumes would be taken away.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:31.100
But they used to get a bit hairy there sometimes.

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:34.100
And no protective footwear either?

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.100
No.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.100
No, it was a lot different then.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:43.100
So do you think the work was dangerous in any way?

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.100
Yes, it was.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:51.100
Rydyn ni'n mynd i'n gyrraedd ymlaen ac ymlaen.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:55.100
Rydyn ni'n siŵr bod rhywun wedi llai amonia unrhyw ddwy o bach.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:58.100
A chyfrwyd y bach oedd 2.5 litri.

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:03.100
A byddai hynny'n bach.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:07.100
Roedd hi'n gallu cael rhan o'r marn.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:14.100
Ond nid oedd un o'r chyfrwyr sy'n gweithio ar y rhan o'r cyfrwyr.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:19.100
Roedd yn cués ör reality o fy Francis y Wylf,

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:23.100
a oedd wedi ch 기억io,

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:27.100
yn falch o fater y stannwn wrthidit.

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.100
T ander bach.

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:33.100
Roedd yn mannydd danyw dirt oil,

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:37.100
fel hangan t decomplydd.

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:49.100
roedd o'n gysylltu cymdeithas, ac roedd yna 6 o'r botylau, y botylau yma, yn un crêt cyrnod,

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:54.100
un botyl cyrnod, gyda pethau i wneud, a dyna beth yma yma yn ei wneud.

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:57.100
A'r botyl cyrnod yn cael eu gael.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.100
Beth sydd wedi'i ddod o'r hyn?

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:37.100
A oes gennych chi unrhyw bach neu bobl sydd wedi'i ddod?

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:43.100
Nid yn y lab. Rwy'n meddwl, roedd gennym gysylltu cymdeithas a chyfrwngwyr o asid.

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:50.100
Roedd gennych gysylltu cymdeithas o asid, ond gysylltu asid, oherwydd byddwch chi'n defnyddio pipetau.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:57.100
Rwy'n meddwl bod hi wedi'i ddod i bawb sydd wedi gweithio mewn lab.

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.100
Felly, beth byddai'n dda i'w gael os oedd gennych gwyb.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:07.100
Yn oed, byddai'n dda i'w ddod i'w ddod a chwaetio'r gwyb, a'i gwyb yn cael ei fod yn ffwrdd, a'i gwyb yn cael ei fod yn ymwneud.

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:13.100
Dwi ddim yn credu bod nhw'n gwneud hynny yn oed.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:18.100
Byddech chi'n gwneud yn awr am gael a chwaetio a phethau pan oeddwch chi'n gweithio yno?

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:34.100
Dwi'n credu, fel y byddech chi'n dysgu sut i, yw, gwneud y proses, byddech chi'n dweud, dyma asid, byddwch chi'n bwysig.

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:50.100
Os ydych chi'n defnyddio botynau Wohnungiaethau Lla ei fodn nhw ni, byw ynifod, ond pan rydw i'n medd exchangedi o Bliss, roedd eu cym clouds yn amlwg ar y wneuthro,

00:28:50.100 --> 00:29:00.500
Does mae gyd Babylwch o'r holl ernst fridge elegant, hyd yn cym 단raeddau pam gael ffeinio yn

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:04.500
Mae'r amser yma yn dweud y byddwch chi ddim yn adnabod water i ased solfuriol,

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.500
rydych chi'n gwneud hynny'n ymlaen.

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.500
Ac os ydych chi'n defnyddio soda costig a chyflwyno water,

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.500
rydych chi'n gweithio'n bwysig o hynny.

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.500
Ond unrhyw beth sy'n dda i'n ffeillio yw,

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.500
roedd nhw'n defnyddio cyanide.

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:21.500
Mae'n dda.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:25.500
Rwy'n meddwl y byddwn yn dweud hynny.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.500
Beth oedd yn ddigwydd yn y tîm?

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.500
Dwi ddim yn dechrau ddefnyddio cyanide, rwy'n dechrau.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.500
Mae'n rhaid i ni ddod yn dda,

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:36.500
ond dwi ddim yn dechrau ddefnyddio hynny.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:39.500
A'n dda i'n dechrau'n dda hefyd.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.500
Mae'n dda'r dymaint amlwg amlwg.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.500
Ie, ie.

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.500
Felly dwi ddim yn cwerfod hynny.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.500
Ond pan ddoddw i'n meddwl,

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:52.500
roedd y byd yn dda i gyd yn dda i gyd.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:56.500
A gallwch chi ddod o'r pwy sydd wedi'i cael?

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.500
Pan ddoddw i, £2, 10 cilin a ddigwydd.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.500
Rwy'n dechrau.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.500
A oedd yn cael,

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.500
dwi'n meddwl,

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.500
beth oedd yn ei wneud ymlaen?

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.500
Roedd yn cael ei gael yn ôl?

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.500
Nid, nid, roedd fy moth wedi'i cael 15 cilin.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.500
A roedd hi'n cael y rest.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.500
A, yn ogystal â,

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.500
os oeddwn ni wedi cael ymlaen o 5 cilin a ddigwydd,

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.500
dydwom mai oeddwn yn clover.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.500
Felly oeddwch chi'n cael ymlaen?

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.500
Pan oeddwch chi'n cael ymlaen?

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.500
Gallwch chi cael ymlaen

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:29.500
ar eich brydyn,

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.500
i gydag unrhyw amser.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:32.500
A gallwn ni ddod o'r pwy sydd i'n cael ei gael

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.500
yn £5 a ddigwydd.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.500
Dydwodd i, oeddwn i'n teimlo fel miliwner.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.500
Beth oedd yn cael ei wneud,

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.500
yng nghymdeithas,

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:43.500
yn y tîm?

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.500
A oedd yn cael ei wneud fel gwych

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.500
gwych yn ymlaen,

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.500
pan oeddwch chi'n cael ymlaen?

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.500
Ie, rwy'n meddwl, fe wnaeth.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.500
Mae'n cael eu gwych yn ymlaen,

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.500
yn yr un,

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.500
yn y pwy sydd wedi gweithio yn y lab,

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.500
yn cael eu gweithio yn y pwy sydd gennym ni.

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.500
A beth fydd ganddo?

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.500
Dwi ddim yn gwybod beth oedd.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.500
Byddai'n cael gwych yn fwy?

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.500
Dwi'n credu bod yn cael gwych,

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.500
ond nid oedd yn dda.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.500
A yw,

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.500
dyna'r peth.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.500
Rwy'n teimlo,

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.500
gallwn ni ddechrau'r pwy sydd gennym ni,

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.500
yn y pwy sydd gennym ni,

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.500
oherwydd,

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.500
mae'r holl bobl wedi bod yn rhan o'r ddod yn ymlaen,

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.500
fel lunatecs,

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.500
ac mae'r bobl wedi bod yn ymlaen.

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.500
Ond roeddent,

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.500
ydym yn ymwneud,

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.500
roeddent yn mynd i'r ymgyrch,

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.500
roeddent ddim yn gwneud pethau fel hynny.

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.500
Roeddent yn fwy fel hynny, rwy'n deimlo.

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.500
Mae'r un o'r bobl wedi dod yn ymwneud.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.500
Ond roeddent yn cael eu gwych yn ymlaen,

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.500
yn llawer o'n ni.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.500
Rwy'n deimlo.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.500
Felly, a beth wnaeth gydag eich gwych?

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.500
Rwy'n deimlo, roeddent wedi dweud eich bod chi'n cael 15 sielings a'i gwych,

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.500
ac roedd yn gwych ar ddwy o bryd, iawn?

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.500
Ie.

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.500
Felly roedd eich gwych,

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.500
roedd eich gwych yn cael 15 sielings,

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.500
a beth wnaeth gydag eich gwych?

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.500
Roeddwn yn mynd i'r cyfnod ym Mhryd,

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.500
i'r cyfnod,

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.500
i'r gwych,

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.500
os oes gennych,

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.500
nid oes yn dda iawn.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.500
Ond roedd yn dda iawn yn dda iawn,

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.500
ac roedd yn dda i hwn.

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.500
Ie.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.500
Rwy'n meddwl,

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.500
os oes gennych ym Mhryd a nid ydych chi'n dda i gyd yn fuddi allan,

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.500
15 sielings nid oes yn dda iawn.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.500
A oeddwn yn gwych yn yr un bod,

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.500
mae pawb yn yr un.

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.500
Roedd ymlaen.

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.500
Roedd hi'n dda i gyd yn dda?

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.500
Rwy'n,

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.500
rwy'n gobeithio i ddod o hyd at fy mhaidd mwyaf record pwmpenni'n bach.

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.500
Rwy'n gobeithio i ddod o hyd at fy mhaidd mwmpenni'n bach.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.500
Roedd yn dda i ddod o hyd at fy mhaidd mwmpenni'n bach.

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:48.220
dweud y byddwn yn y 50au. Rwy'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n mynd i ddod o beth sydd newydd.

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:58.780
Y record y ddod i'n gwybod yma yw, yw'r teddy bears, rwy'n gwybod, roedd nhw'n gweithio hynny.

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:11.440
Wrth antف мас oediwn jyst ni yn cwmarn tik iawn o'dd worldも lle i dd dryeriedd,

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:20.680
man crffu gyfan a ddarfer yn y t 해야eth yma, roeddwn ni ychydig yn barhau fy magh sweetness.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:24.680
roeddwn i'n mynd i'r hynny. Rydw i'n mynd i'r hynny. Rydw i'n mynd i'r hynny.

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:30.680
Felly, roedd gennych chi'n dweud y byddai ychydig o'ch ddau yno yno.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.680
Roeddwch chi'n dweud ychydig o'r amser?

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:37.680
Nid, roedd... Rydw i'n gwybod, unwaith, roedd yna ddwy o'n ni, roeddwn i'n dweud ychydig o'r amser.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.680
A roeddwn i'n siarad â un o'r amser y ddau yna.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:44.680
Roeddwn i'n ceisio i ddod yn ymwybod. Roeddwn i'n dweud ychydig o 17.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:48.680
Roedd yna unrhyw ddau o'r amser yna.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:55.680
Rydw i ddim yn gwybod beth yw'n digwydd i'r hyn nesaf oherwydd roeddwn i wedi'i gael ymddygiad.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.680
Ond dyna pan roeddwn i'n dechrau i'r ymddygiad.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:04.680
Oherwydd, yn y ddau yna, y mwyaf o bobl yn ymddygiad.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:09.680
Rydw i'n gwybod, mae llawer o bobl wedi'i dweud, roedd yn dechrau i'r ymddygiad pan roedd yn dechrau gweithio.

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:16.680
Rydw i'n gwybod, mae llawer o bobl yn ymddygiad a phan o'r ddau yn dweud, o, gadewch un o'r hyn.

00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:22.680
Yn ogystal â'r smog, roedd yn ogystal â'r smog yn ymddygiad neu roedd yn ogystal â'r smog?

00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:23.680
Roedd yn ogystal â'r smog yn ymddygiad.

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:29.680
Roedd yn ogystal â'r smog pan roedd yn gwneud y cyfnodau, oherwydd roedd wedi'i gael ymddygiad o'r cwmpaniaeth.

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:34.680
Ond os oes gennych, sef 15 munud, mewn blynedd o oriau,

00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:37.680
oherwydd roedd yn ogystal â'r smog yn ymddygiad neu rhywbeth,

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.680
pan oedd yn ogystal â'r smog a chael y cyfnodau.

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:41.680
Felly gallwch chi ddweud ymddygiad yn y cyfnodau?

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:45.680
Roedd gennym ddweud y smog yn y rhan bwyd, lle mae'r ffotio hwn yn cael ei ddweud,

00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:50.680
lle maen nhw'n, yw, yn ymddygiad, a chyflenio o ffyrnusau.

00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:56.680
Ond roedd yn ogystal â'r rhan bwyd a chael y smog.

00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:00.680
Ond roedd pobl yn ogystal â'r smog yn ogystal â'r ffyrnusau.

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:04.680
Roedd ymddygiad yn ogystal â'r smog?

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.680
Dwi ddim yn credu bod nhw'n ogystal â'r smog, nid, nid.

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.680
Roedd y mwyaf o'n ogystal â'r smog.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.680
Ie, a'r bobl.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.680
Ie, ie.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:19.680
Felly roedd y byddai'n oed yn oed yn oed, os oeddwch chi ddim yn ogystal â'r smog yna.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:26.680
Ie, oherwydd rydym yn dweud hynny, yn ogystal â phobl sy'n ogystal â'r smog.

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:30.680
Roeddwn yn y mwyaf pan oeddwn yn ogystal â'r smog.

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:35.680
Ac nawr, wrth gwrs, rydych chi'n ogystal â phobl sy'n ogystal â'r smog.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:40.680
Dyna ni, rydw i wedi'i stopio llawer o blynyddoedd yn ôl.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.680
A oes gennych chi...

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:51.680
Rydwch chi'n ddweud, oes gennych chi, pan oeddwch chi'n gwybod £5 y ddwy?

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.680
A oes gennych chi pan oeddwch chi?

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.680
Roeddwn yn oed... oedd yn oed...

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.680
Nid, nid oedd yn oed pan oeddwn yn 18.

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:02.680
Rydw i'n credu bod yn oed pan oeddwn yn 21.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.680
Ac roeddwn yn gweithio ar ystyrwyr yna, rydw i'n credu.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.680
Ie, roeddwn yn oed.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.680
Mae'n rhaid bod yn...

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.680
Mae'n rhaid bod yn...

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.680
Nid, dwi ddim yn gallu ei roi.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.680
Mae'n rhaid bod yn oed pan oeddwn yn...

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:20.680
mewn ystyr 17 a 21.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.640
cart ti i gymryd?

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.680
Nid.

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:25.680
Gallai.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:30.680
Gofodd allud, oherwydd ganddefnydd o ran蜂'r vi fronten

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:35.640
mae pob o ail i deall ак Messwyl, ond mael roedd hi ni'n gerechtio.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:40.680
Felly, na laut i gymryd yn yr holl gweithio?

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.640
Itt, itt, itt, inni?

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:45.640
No, d nineteen, beth fe wnaeth,

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.640
pan oedd wedi rhoi hwn Wedi'i rydyn ar 26 caráf,

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:54.640
a'r llwybr a'r llwybr, dwi ddim yn gwybod. Ond pan oeddwn i yno, nid oedd unigol yn unigol.

00:36:54.640 --> 00:37:02.640
Roedd yna ddysguau, yna? Beth ydych chi'n ei wneud? Beth yw'r bobl yn ei wneud os yna ddysguau?

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.640
Dwi ddim yn credu ein bod gennym unrhywbeth yn y lab.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:09.640
Rwy'n rhaid i'n gwybod bod y chap sydd y chemistrwyr cymdeithasol yno,

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:13.640
a dwi'n credu bod yn unigol, yn fwy o'r chemist.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.640
Roedd yn unigol iawn i'r chap.

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:23.640
Rwy'n rhaid i'n gwybod, roedd yn fwyaf o'r ffomau,'r ddau.

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.640
Roedd yn unigol o'r ddau oedd yn dda.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:32.640
Roedd yn, yn ymwneud, os oes gennym ddau o'r ddau,

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:35.640
ond roedd yn dda, ychydig o bryd o'r ddau.

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:39.640
Rwy'n gwybod bod un ddau y byddai'n siarad am ddansgio ballroom

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.640
a am ddansgio amdano.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.640
Felly, un o'r ddau oedd yn siarad,

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.640
a dwi'n meddwl, sut ydych chi'n ei wneud hynny?

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:49.640
Mae'r ddau o'r ddau yn dda, ddau o'r ddau yn gwybod.

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:53.640
Roedd yn gwneud hynny, mae'n fel tango.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.640
Roedd yn gwybod y ddau yn ymwneud ac roedd yn gwybod,

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.640
a fel y bydd hwn yn digwydd, y bos yn ymwneud.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.640
Roedd yn dweud, a ydych chi'n dda pethau'n iawn?

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:06.640
Roedd yn dda yn dda'n dda'n dda.

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:12.640
A'r ddau oedd yn cael eu gweithio a'r ddau yn ystod ymwneud hefyd.

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:16.640
Roedd yn dda pethau'n dda, dda ffyn.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:20.640
How did you feel about their not being, at the time,

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.640
about their not being a New Englander?

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.640
I think lots of people, well, you know,

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:29.640
I used to think that was very unfair and it was bad.

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:33.640
But, you know, that was just the way it was

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:38.640
and so most people accepted it.

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:42.640
You know, there may have been problems out on the factory floor,

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:47.640
no doubt there were, but it didn't really bother us

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:53.640
and I think perhaps at 17 and 18 you're not too worried about that.

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:58.640
What were the conditions there, do you think, looking back?

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:04.640
You said it was very hot. What about the lighting?

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:08.640
I think that was strip lighting, you know,

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.640
I've got one in my kitchen.

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:15.640
As far as I remember, that's what we used was,

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:20.640
I can never remember the name of that stuff, those lights.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.640
So that was pretty good then?

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.640
Yeah, so there was plenty of light there.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:31.640
You had to be able to see, to write things and to weigh things out,

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:35.640
to see the balances, because in that balance room

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:42.640
there were lots of big windows so that there was plenty of light in there.

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:47.640
And out in the lab where we did all the work.

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:51.640
So you say it was hot.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:56.640
Was it cold in any place then? Was it really cold anywhere?

00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:02.640
Not upstairs, no, not where we worked, no, it was usually hot.

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:05.640
Even though there were big windows and things?

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.640
Well, you never used to open the windows,

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:18.640
because they were old swing balances, any light draft would affect it.

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:24.640
So, no, no, what about ventilation then? Was there any ventilation?

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:27.640
Not as far as I remember.

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:33.640
I mean the extractor fans over the hot plates, that's all I remember.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:38.640
Do you think you've suffered any ill effects from being there apart from the dermatitis?

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:40.640
No, I don't think so.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:45.640
No. And I worked in other labs as well.

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:49.640
I worked down at Distillers down in Barry,

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:54.640
and then I worked in the Ministry of Agriculture for 21 years.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:41:02.640
And, you know, well, touch wood, I think I'm all right, seem to be.

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.640
As far as I know, I'm all right.

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:11.640
So what were the facilities like apart from you had a good and okay canteen?

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:16.640
How would you describe the facilities like toilets and stuff like that?

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.640
There was one toilet for us girls.

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.640
That was all, yes.

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:27.640
There was a foot bath there. I don't know why, I don't think anybody used it.

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:30.640
And that was it.

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:36.640
You know, there was a cloakroom to hang your coats and that sort of thing, but that was all.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:43.640
Sometimes we used to work in the lab when the factory stopped for a fortnight,

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.640
and we'd clean everything.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:52.640
We'd go down in the basement cleaning and all this, and we used to be black afterwards.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:42:01.640
The boss arranged for us to go over and use the men's showers over by the nail factory.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:08.640
So a group of us girls were going over, but we had to take a chap with us because the door didn't lock.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:13.640
So he stood guard outside the door while we were all in use in the showers.

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.640
And because he was a bit of a card and he was saying,

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:23.640
Are you all right girls? Do you want me to come and scrub you back?

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:29.640
But, you know, I mean, there were no other things there really.

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.640
So did you feel that the facilities weren't good at the time?

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:38.640
No, it didn't, because you didn't know any different.

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:44.640
You know, it was the first lab I'd been in, and probably the first lab most of the people had been in.

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:48.640
But did you think that it was strange that the men had showers but the women didn't?

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:52.640
Oh, it was the men out on the factory floor.

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:58.640
It wasn't, you know, the chaps that worked in the lab, they didn't have showers.

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:09.640
But I just thought of this now, that the amusing thing was the boss had his own toilet, his executive toilet.

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:16.640
And it was just up a few steps from the lab, and I suppose it was tidy because very often people have said,

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:23.640
Oh, go upstairs, go and use his toilet if he wasn't there.

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:33.640
But, you know, there was nothing like showers for, you know, if you got dirty or anything like that.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:43.640
And when the weather was very hot, you know, if it was nice, hot, sunny weather, some of us used to go up on the roof.

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:51.640
It was a flat roof and sunbathe. And it was black up there. It was as black as the airspace up there.

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:57.640
Because of, you know, all the muck from the steelworks, it was the middle of a factory.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:03.640
And we used to stretch out on these old overalls, try to get a sun tan. We must have been mad.

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:14.640
What about the relationship between you, between the women and the men? Was it, how would you describe that?

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:19.640
I think it was fine. A lot depended on personalities.

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:28.640
You know, some people were less popular than others, but they know we usually all got on all right.

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:32.640
Was there any harassment either way?

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:41.640
No. Well, I can only remember there was a chap who worked there and he was like an odd job man.

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:48.640
And he came up and people, and the girls would say, stay away from him. Stay away from him.

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:54.640
And all those, all the girls would avoid him. And he came up behind me once and put his arms around me.

00:44:54.640 --> 00:45:02.640
So I stuck my elbow in his stomach. It was just automatic. I didn't think about it. It just came straight back.

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:12.640
And what about the girls and the men? Did they used to harass the men? That's what I mean by either way.

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:20.640
Might nag them. Yes, and pull their leg and things like that.

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:29.640
But do you mean being officious or perhaps sexual harassment?

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:33.640
Yes, sexual, crude comments, that kind of thing.

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:38.640
No. And you see, nobody used bad language in those days.

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:44.640
And to be honest, if any of them, oh sorry, it's the central heating coming on.

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:51.640
If anybody, I think if any of the men were making a nuisance of themselves and the girls had gone to the boss,

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:56.640
there would have been ructions, I think.

00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:03.640
Yes, no, I didn't actually come across any, only this one chap.

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:07.640
Most people are saying, keep away from him.

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:11.640
So it's quite a pleasant atmosphere. Yes, yes, yes.

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:16.640
What about holidays then? How many? Two weeks a year.

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:18.640
Paid? Yes.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:22.640
And could you take them at any time?

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:27.640
Well, yes, you could. Because they used to have stop fortnights for the factory,

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:33.640
but if you chose to go in to work, you could and you ended up cleaning everywhere.

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:41.640
So as long as it didn't sort of clash with anybody else, yes, it was quite good.

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:44.640
But it was only the two weeks that you had then.

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:47.640
But the factory did sort of close down for you. Yes.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:51.640
Yes, yes, yes.

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:53.640
We could stop going.

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:57.640
Were you aware, what about the factory workers, did they have to take the time off?

00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:01.640
Yes, they closed the place down.

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:09.640
Whatever, like the nail factory would close, the rod mill and all the rest of them,

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:12.640
I can't remember what they all were.

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.640
But no, that used to close down.

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:18.640
And bank holidays work? Did you have paid bank holidays this Christmas?

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:22.640
Yes, but we always worked Good Friday.

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.640
Good Friday isn't a bank holiday.

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:29.640
Ah, but the bank closes, doesn't it? The banks close.

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:31.640
Well, it's not an official bank holiday.

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:34.640
Ah, right, but this was back in the 50s.

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:38.640
Yes, but it's still not an official bank holiday, Good Friday.

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.640
All right. Ah, yes.

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:46.640
Because there wouldn't be many buses then.

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:51.640
And I can remember I used to catch a very early bus from Fairwater and get to town.

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:57.640
And it would be something like three-quarters of an hour wait for the works bus.

00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:00.640
So I used to walk. Lots of people did.

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:05.640
We'd walk all down Tyndall Street and up Eastmarsh Road.

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:09.640
And I think of it now, I thought, we must have been mad.

00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:14.640
Yes. How long did it take you to get to work?

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:17.640
On the bus. On the bus.

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:20.640
When did you leave in the morning? Because if you...

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:24.640
Yes. Did I used to... I'm trying to remember which bus I used to catch.

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:28.640
I probably used to catch one about seven minutes to eight.

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.640
There was always a bus at seven minutes to eight and I used it for years,

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:35.640
I think, when I was in school as well.

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:42.640
And then you'd get into Cardiff, you know, by the Central Station there.

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:47.640
And the thing was you didn't want to miss the works bus.

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.640
And that would go about twenty to nine.

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:53.640
I think there was another one then at quarter to nine.

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:58.640
They were Cardiff City buses, you know, just the double-deckers.

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:05.640
I think there was a conductor on them and also somebody from the company,

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:12.640
you know, would be standing there with the bus conductor,

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:15.640
making sure everybody was behaving.

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:22.640
So it took you a while to get to work then? Yes, yes.

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:26.640
Yes, the same as I suppose things are today.

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:30.640
It takes longer if you have to wait, you know,

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:34.640
if you have to catch a couple of different buses or trains

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:36.640
and you've got to wait in between.

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:40.640
So then it does take a bit longer.

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:43.640
You said your friends worked in the office.

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:47.640
How many people worked in the offices, Jean, did you know?

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:52.640
There were quite a lot there because they had quite a few different divisions.

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:56.640
I mean, she would know because she used to do the wages.

00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:02.640
And because they had a sales section,

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:10.640
they had another section that there were girls there that did the punch cards.

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:16.640
There would be a typing pool and there was a drawing office, you know,

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:22.640
and I think probably like lots of factories that were manufacturing to sell,

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:27.640
they would probably all have the same sort of departments.

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:31.640
But there was quite a lot of people work there.

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:37.640
So what about the factory floor? Did any women work on the factory floor?

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:43.640
I don't think so. I never came across any. No.

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:47.640
Was that really heavy work on the floor, do you think?

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:53.640
I think it may well have been, yes.

00:50:53.640 --> 00:51:01.640
Yes, because, you know, I can remember sort of walking past one of the buildings

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:06.640
and I can't remember what it was called, whether it was the cold roll mill or something like this.

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:16.640
I saw this sort of steel coming out of the little furnace, wherever it was coming from,

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:22.640
and it was sort of big thick rods, you know, and that was going straight,

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:27.640
not like on a curved track like the one where I saw it come off.

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:33.640
But, you know, it did look pretty heavy work.

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:36.640
Where did you see it come off again?

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:39.640
Oh, just walking past. Oh, when it came off?

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:44.640
Oh, that was over in Trimorfer Works, which was also part of Gaskin and Etelfolds.

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.640
I think that was the rod mill.

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.640
Why had you gone over there?

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:52.640
Oh, they just thought they would show us, you know,

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:56.640
that we'd probably analyse some steel that they were producing there,

00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:01.640
and they just thought they would, you know, take some of us over

00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:06.640
so that we could see how the other half was living, really.

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:10.640
But that was interesting, I must admit, and frightening.

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:18.640
Yes. Can you describe the works, the first time you saw it, that kind of, you know?

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:26.640
Well, mostly what I saw, I didn't actually get out into where the, you know, the men worked,

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:31.640
because actually the office buildings looked quite nice,

00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:40.640
and there were about four separate blocks of offices when I went there,

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:48.640
and they weren't sort of old, you know, like some of the old, you know, the old sort of stone buildings.

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:51.640
They weren't like that. They were brick buildings.

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:56.640
And they were just two floors. You know, they weren't tall buildings.

00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:04.640
But that all looked tidy, and you walked across the yard,

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:10.640
and the yard was tarmacked. That was fine.

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:14.640
And then, you know, then you worked a bit further on.

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:17.640
That was when you started crossing the railway lines,

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:23.640
and that's when you were getting closer to where all the business end went on.

00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:28.640
And there were two labs. There was the one I was in was the control lab,

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:35.640
but there was also a fuel lab next door, and they were more or less the same sort of buildings.

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:41.640
They were just like a square, and they were two stories with flat roofs.

00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:47.640
I did go in the fuel lab once or twice, but not to work.

00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:52.640
I just knew somebody. The chap there was in tech where I was.

00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:55.640
We were doing the same course.

00:53:55.640 --> 00:54:01.640
What was it like then on the factory floor, inside those big sheds?

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:04.640
It looked dark, and dirty.

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:08.640
Tell me about when the rods came off, because I think you told me that, didn't you?

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:15.640
Oh, sorry. I don't know where it came from,

00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:25.640
but this rod, and it was not a thick rod, not sort of two inches diameter or anything like that.

00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:34.640
It came shooting out, and it travelled quite fast on a track, and the steel was red hot.

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:41.640
And when we were up in the control room, one of the rods came off the track,

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:47.640
and just went snaking across the factory floor, and everybody just jumped out of the way,

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:51.640
because you couldn't do anything else.

00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:54.640
That was frightening. I only saw that once. That was enough.

00:54:54.640 --> 00:55:01.640
But I'd heard chaps talk about it happening, you know, and some nasty accidents, I think.

00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:06.640
But I can't remember what.

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:13.640
In social life, were there any social activities organised by the workers?

00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:22.640
Yes, there was a sports club, Nettlefolds, and I think it was shared with the big steelworks,

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:29.640
you know, that was alongside St. George Street, and it ran parallel to that.

00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:36.640
They had a lovely sports club down on Sloper Road, and there was quite a bit of ground with it,

00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:39.640
you know, with football, pitches and all the rest of it.

00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:48.640
We often went down there, and we'd challenge another department to play Skittles,

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:52.640
so we'd just go down and play Skittles and things like that.

00:55:53.640 --> 00:56:00.640
It was a very nice club, yeah, but I think, well, there's houses built there now anyway.

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:03.640
So did you go there quite often?

00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:08.640
No, no, no. I think the only times I went there was when, you know,

00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:12.640
we sort of had a little challenge, Skittles match, that's all.

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:14.640
Did you have a bar and things like that?

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:15.640
Yes, yeah.

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:21.640
What about Christmas activities, Christmas parties and stuff like that?

00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:23.640
They're usually famous.

00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:30.640
They used to have staff dances or dinners and dance down at,

00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:35.640
sometimes they'd have them down at Bindles, down in Barry,

00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:42.640
but they also used to have, I think they had a couple of,

00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:46.640
they used to have some things in the Royal Hotel in Cardiff.

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:52.640
The meals were always awful, but the dancing was okay.

00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:57.640
No, they used to, and the last day that we worked, you know,

00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:02.640
well, perhaps we'd finish work at 12, it might be Christmas Eve,

00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:06.640
we always had a party in the lab because the time we came out,

00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:08.640
all the buses had gone.

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:13.640
So we used to hitchhike.

00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:19.640
But there'd be a big group of us and, you know, lots of lorries going past

00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:22.640
and we got into the back of an egg lorry one day,

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:27.640
but there were a big group of us, you know, it wasn't like hitchhiking on your own.

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:31.640
So these Christmas parties, I mean these dinners and dances,

00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:33.640
were they always Christmas do's?

00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:35.640
Yes, yes, yes.

00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:49.640
Were they attended by workers or workers and their families or partners or whatever?

00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:58.640
Yeah, there was always, you know, a difference between the workers and the staff,

00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:03.640
because the girls that worked upstairs in the lab, we were staff.

00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:06.640
Most of the men who worked downstairs were works.

00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:13.640
So they would have separate do's for staff and the workers.

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:16.640
They always had separate evening do's,

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:21.640
because the works ones would be much bigger because there were lots of,

00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:24.640
you know, there were much more men working out there.

00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:27.640
I assume they took their wives.

00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:38.640
Were there a kind of, did the staff look down on the workers or were you aware of any kind of social hierarchy?

00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:40.640
I don't think so.

00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:44.640
Well, you know, I didn't feel that way because, you know,

00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:48.640
you'd get some of the men from the factory floor coming up for something or other,

00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:54.640
because the chaps who worked, lots of the chaps who worked downstairs preparing all the samples,

00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:57.640
they were works, you know, they weren't staff,

00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:03.640
and you sort of got to know them, you know, say good morning, have a little chat.

00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:06.640
So I didn't feel that way.

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:09.640
We used to go into the workers' canteen sometimes.

00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:14.640
I think it was if we worked on a weekend, if something had gone wrong,

00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:17.640
because the staff canteen wouldn't be open.

00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:20.640
Why the segregation then, do you think?

00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:23.640
Was it just because of numbers maybe?

00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:25.640
Yeah, maybe.

00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:33.640
I mean, using different buildings may have been because of the workmen in their dirty overalls,

00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:40.640
and then, you know, the sort of, especially lots of the young ladies who worked in the offices,

00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:43.640
they would be very smart.

00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:50.640
And so the works canteen was not really very,

00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:54.640
left a lot to be desired, shall we say.

00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:58.640
But I mean, we used to use it if we were there on weekends,

00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:06.640
because we'd go in and have some chips and not just something to eat.

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.640
How long did you work there?

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.640
Five years altogether.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.640
And what did you do afterwards?

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.640
I had a break in between.

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:20.640
I went down to distillers for a couple of years down in Barry, which is BP now.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.640
Oh, all right.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:27.640
They made PVC and resins and things like that.

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:30.640
How did that compare to GKN?

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:38.640
Oh, it was a lot different, because the lab I was in there was not a control lab.

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:41.640
So tell me what the difference is then.

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:46.640
A control lab is you're just checking everything that's been made

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:50.640
to make sure it's up to specification.

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:58.640
Whereas when I went to work in distillers, they were making PVC,

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:09.640
and we were trying to sort of, we were test to see if we could get it to be useful for some sort of purpose.

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:13.640
You know, a company would perhaps get in touch with somebody and say,

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:16.640
look, can you try doing this?

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:23.640
And I can remember doing something with some product, I can't remember what.

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:32.640
And what it did was it waterproofed something, so it looked a bit like one of these yellow oil skins.

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:38.640
And then we tested PVC to use as records, you know, discs.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:48.640
And there was actually a machine there that would press a disc, make it, and I had one and I played it for years.

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.640
On PVC?

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.640
Yes, yes, and things like that.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:58.640
So it was a, and it wasn't quite so, it wasn't so mucky and dirty.

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:02.640
There were lots more labs there as well, there were a lot of labs there.

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:05.640
Were there a lot of women working there?

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:06.640
Yes.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:14.640
And was it the same kind of, did you, you know, what did you prefer, which workplace did you prefer really?

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:23.640
I think I preferred steelworks because I preferred the work, I think,

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:29.640
because I preferred to have a structure and something that told me what I had to do

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:33.640
rather than sort of think, oh, well, I'll try this, or I'll try that.

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:35.640
I'm not very good at that.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:38.640
So I preferred that work.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:42.640
What about the camaraderie and the social life?

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:45.640
Did you make friends down in Distillers as well?

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:55.640
Yes, yes, yes, and I mean, because it was in Barry, so I know quite a lot of people in Barry as well.

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:58.640
And there were some real characters work there.

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:02.640
There were always characters somewhere, wherever you work.

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.640
What about the wages down in Distillers?

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:07.640
What year were we talking about here?

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.640
When did I go there?

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:18.640
When I was 19 or 20, so it could have been, it was 1960, 61, something like that.

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:23.640
And the wages were a bit better, they paid more.

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:27.640
And then they put us on to monthly pay.

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:32.640
That absolutely floored me.

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:40.640
I expect lots of others were the same because you get paid for a month and you think, gosh, I'm rich.

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:48.640
And for a whole week you have a wonderful time and then you can't afford to go out.

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:53.640
And I can remember my mother found it difficult.

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:59.640
And she said to me in the end, she said, I'm sorry, but you'll have to give me money weekly.

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:04.640
I can't cope with it monthly because she'd always used to handle in money weekly.

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.640
So that's what I did.

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:10.640
And I still actually budget weekly now.

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:14.640
How did you get down to Barry?

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.640
I went on the bus.

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:21.640
And then I did just to get a lift then with the chap who lived in Pensiesley Road.

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.640
I'd catch the bus down to Pensiesley Road.

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:30.640
I was there in 1963 in the bad winter.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:36.640
And it was strange because we got to work.

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.640
People from Barry couldn't get in.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:48.640
We always used to say, Barry's like Rome, built on seven hills.

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:51.640
But everywhere you go in Barry there's a hill.

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:54.640
So they couldn't get there.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:57.640
So how long were you there for?

01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:59.640
Two years I think.

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.640
I went back to the steelworks then.

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.640
Oh did you?

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.640
For a couple of years then.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.640
And what was that like going back there?

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.640
There were different people there.

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:12.640
It wasn't such, you know, it was okay.

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:18.640
But you know, lots of the people who'd been there when I'd worked there before had gone.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:22.640
And there were some people there that were a bit more difficult.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:25.640
But never mind.

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:28.640
Then I went to the Ministry of Agriculture.

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:30.640
And what was that like?

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:32.640
I loved it.

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.640
That was good.

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.640
Yeah, that was lab work as well.

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:45.640
That was analysing agricultural materials, soil and feed for sheep and cows and hay.

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:47.640
And lots of different things.

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.640
And it was only a small place.

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:51.640
Where was that?

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:52.640
In Llanisian.

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:54.640
You know where the tax offices are?

01:05:54.640 --> 01:06:02.640
It was on the site there when the whole area was all single storey buildings.

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:05.640
And I did enjoy it there.

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:07.640
I was there for 21 years.

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:09.640
And then they closed the stand.

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:15.640
Are you in contact with any of your workmates from the factories?

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:17.640
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:21.640
I spoke to one the other day.

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:25.640
And I met her for coffee not so long ago.

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:26.640
And there's another one.

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:28.640
The three of us were all the same age.

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:31.640
And you know, we were sort of very friendly.

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:33.640
And I've seen the other one as well.

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:36.640
And then I spoke to my friend the other day.

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:38.640
The one who got you the job?

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:39.640
Yes, yes.

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:40.640
Told me about it.

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:41.640
Yes, yes.

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:48.640
Because we were talking about the chaps who were some of the chaps that worked downstairs.

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:53.640
And so, you know, she was saying that one chap she hasn't seen for a long time.

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:58.640
And she used to see him regularly in Ely, I think.

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.640
Because she lives over in Ely now.

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:06.640
And just chatting and laughing about the different things that used to go on.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:08.640
What about your friends from Bally?

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:10.640
Do you see your workmates from Bally?

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:11.640
Do you see them?

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:16.640
Well, my best friend, you know, we became very close friends.

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:19.640
But she died 20 years ago now.

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:20.640
But I do see her husband.

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.640
I go down to see him.

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:23.640
And I see him.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:24.640
And I see him.

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:25.640
And I see him.

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:26.640
And I see him.

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:27.640
And I see him.

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.640
I do see her husband.

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:29.640
I go down to see him.

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:31.640
And I see her boys.

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:34.640
Well, they're not boys, they're men now.

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:37.640
And so I keep in touch with them.

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:42.640
But I don't see anybody else from Distillers now.

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:46.640
Used to when my pal was single.

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:50.640
Because he used to spend a lot of time down in Bally.

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.640
You know, on the beach in the summer.

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:56.640
And going to parties and things like that.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:57.640
But so...

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:58.640
Yeah.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:06.640
But looking back, how do you feel about the time you spent working in, you know, in GKN and in...

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.640
Or GKN especially as well?

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:09.640
Yeah.

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:13.640
I do sometimes think to myself I did the wrong thing.

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:19.640
Because I got as far...

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:23.640
I managed to do only National Certificate in Chemistry.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:27.640
But when I went on to do the Higher National Certificate, I just thought to myself,

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:29.640
Oh, this isn't making sense anymore.

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:33.640
And I do think I might have been better off doing something else.

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:38.640
Like working in a bank or something like that with figures.

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:45.640
Because when I moved over to the Welsh office,

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:50.640
I ended up working in Finance for the last ten years.

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.640
And I enjoyed that.

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:57.640
You know, I still would have been better with bigger work than any of the other work.

01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:00.640
Do you think that was your...

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:03.640
In a way, you were better at maths and chemistry then?

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.640
Yes, perhaps, yes.

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:13.640
Because the thing is, when I went to work in the Welsh office,

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.640
I was...

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:17.640
How old was I?

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:19.640
Forty-five, I think.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:27.640
And the way that civil service works, writing submissions for ministers and all that sort of thing,

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:30.640
I had never done anything like that.

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:33.640
And that really floored me, I must admit.

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:37.640
I couldn't get on with that.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:43.640
So I was happier with doing Finance with figures because you're either right or you're wrong.

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:50.640
And when you're writing submissions and all this sort of thing,

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:55.640
it's very often how other people interpret things.

01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:59.640
And sometimes I think, this is a waste of time.

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:03.640
But I was OK once I worked in Finance.

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:05.640
I was OK then.

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:08.640
I enjoyed that.

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:11.640
Great, I think that's...

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:14.640
So when you worked in distillers, yes?

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:18.640
Yes. At Christmas time, people would go out and have a drink.

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:21.640
Well, there was a pub up the road in Sully.

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:27.640
And the young ones from this lab all went up to the pub.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:32.640
And when they came back, they were riding the horses in the field opposite.

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:37.640
They weren't allowed out of Cain.

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:43.640
Oh dear me, that was quite funny, that was.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:48.640
But really, when you hear some of the things that go on today,

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:51.640
you think, well, we all thought we were really daring,

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:56.640
but perhaps we weren't that daring after all.
