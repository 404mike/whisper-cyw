00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
There were the useful presents. Engulfing mufflers of the old court days and mittens made for giant sloths.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Zebra scarves of a substance like silky gum that could be tug-o-warred down to the galoshes.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Blinding tamarish hunters like patchwork teak hoses and bunny-suited busbies and balaclavas for victims of head-shrinking tribes.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.000
From ants who always wore wool next to the skin, there were mustached and rasping vests that made you wonder why the ants had any skin left at all.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And once I had a little crocheted nose-bag from an ant now, alas, no longer winnieing with us.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And pictureless books in which small boys, though warned with quotations not to, would skate on Farmer Giles' pond and did and drowned.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And books that told me everything about the wasp except why.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Bags of moist and many-coloured jelly babies and a folded flag and a false nose and a tram conductor's cap and a machine that punched tickets and rang a bell.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Never a catapult. Once, by mistake, that no one could explain a little hatchet.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And a celluloid duck that made, when you pressed it, a most unduck-like sound, a mewing moo that an ambitious cat might make who wished to be a cow.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And a painting book in which I could make the grass, the trees, the sea and the animals any colour I pleased.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And still the dazzling sky-blue sheep are grazing in the red humbugs, glaciers, marzipan and butter Welsh for the Welsh.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And troops of bright-tin soldiers who, if they could not fight, could always run.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And snakes and families and happy ladders and easy hobby games for little engineers, complete with instructions.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Oh, easy for Leonardo.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And a whistle to make the dogs bark, to wake up the old man next door, to make him beat on the wall with his stick, to shake our picture off the wall.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And a packet of cigarettes. You put one in your mouth and you stood at the corner of the street and you waited for hours in vain for an old lady to scold you for smoking a cigarette.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And then with a smirk you ate it.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And then it was breakfast under the balloons.
