Hallelujah, hallelujah!

00:35:51.840 --> 00:36:10.840
O remind me, O remind me, With the grace of Calvary,

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:20.840
With the grace of Calvary.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:51.840
To the holy land of Calvary, Where the holy land is,

00:36:51.840 --> 00:37:01.840
To the holy land of Calvary, Where the holy land is.

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:13.840
O remind me, O remind me, With the grace of Calvary,

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:20.840
With the grace of Calvary.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:26.840
Hallelujah, hallelujah!

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:31.840
Our immortal Savior, here,

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:42.840
To the holy land of Calvary, Where the holy land is.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:48.840
Hallelujah, hallelujah!

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:55.840
Amen to the Lord, amen to the Lord.

00:37:55.840 --> 00:38:04.840
Amen to the Lord, amen to the Lord.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:10.840
Ride me, O thou great Jehovah,

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:16.840
Pilgrim through this barren land.

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:22.840
I am weak, but thou art mighty,

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:28.840
Hold me with thy powerful hand.

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:35.840
Strong deliver, strong deliver,

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:43.840
Be thou still my strength and shield.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:52.840
Be thou still my strength and shield.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:58.840
Open now the crystal fountain,

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:04.840
West the healing stream to go.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:10.840
Let the fiery county pillar

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:16.840
Lead me on my journey through.

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:22.840
Bread of heaven, bread of heaven,

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:31.840
Make me now and ever more.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:40.840
Make me now and ever more.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:48.840
When I tread the verge of joy and

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:54.840
In my anxious fears unsigned,

00:39:54.840 --> 00:40:00.840
Bearing through the swelling current,

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:07.840
Let me sing of pain and sigh.

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:13.840
Songs of praise and songs of praise,

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:22.840
I will ever give to thee.

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:31.840
I will ever give to thee.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:38.840
Songs of praise and songs of praise,

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:48.840
I will ever give to thee.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:58.840
I will ever give to thee.

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:05.840
Songs of praise and songs of praise,

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:16.840
I will ever give to thee.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:29.840
Wander me from good-giving land.

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:36.840
Songs of praise and songs of praise,

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:46.840
I will ever give to thee.

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:59.840
I will ever give to thee.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.840
Thank you for watching!
