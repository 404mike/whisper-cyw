00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
David and his daughter.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Explain your great grandparents.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Tom Abergunghie, he was a character in the half.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So who would he be then? So Tom is John and Anne's son?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Yes, son of John and Anne.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
You tell them a creature.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So Tom, that's him there again, Tom and Mary Anne.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Parents of David, so who's David then?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
David used to live with Abergunghie.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And what's he to Michael and...?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I don't know what he is really.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
There's the two girls.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
There's David and Elizabeth Evans.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Parents of Evonrie and Mary.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So that's Evonrie and Mary.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So who would they be? Which Mary?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That's Michael's mother.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Oh it is?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And that's Mary Abergunghie.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Well I know all.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Here's the three boys in school.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Gosh, that's like Amy.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Doesn't make her look like Amy.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We'll sew down.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
See the closing house.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Here's Jim Pugh, I remember that.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
1963 storm.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Him going by helicopter.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Jim Abergunghie.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Look at this.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Hiya.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Jim Pugh.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Evonrie.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So where's that house then?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
She's maybe working on the wall or something.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I have no idea.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
On the Land Army in Shropshire.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So it could be some sort of...

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I wanted to see some of these bigger photographs.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Jim Pugh.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Jim Pugh.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I'll say that's John.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
That's John, is it?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Who's the one in the middle?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Granville Price, I think.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
He was from Lennartho.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
That's Michael Bennett.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
That's Harpy, John Lloyd.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Desmond Thomas.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Tudor Ingram.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I think Hacker Davis.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Her brother, Wyndham Davis, they name it.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Yes, yes.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Was that not Jim Dunne?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I'll say it's Tudor Ingram.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Doolin's brother?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
No, no.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Tudor Ingram Foster, we used to call him.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Oh, right.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Although he looks a bit too...

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Almost looks a bit too fat for him, really.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I remember this picture.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Yes, I was in the pool, I was.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Oh, there you are then.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I remember that.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
My father was throwing his all in there.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
51, that's right.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Yes, 61.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
51?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Oh, wait a minute.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I remember that.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And this is when they opened it.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Do you remember?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Yes, I remember that.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
That's Roy Boyne.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Yes, yes.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
That's it, I was on the TV one of the children.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Oh, that's it then?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And Dad was, as I say, throwing his all in.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Yes, exactly.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Oh, yeah.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Oh, gosh, you want to cry.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
You need a week in here, don't you?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
You want the ages.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Ellen Ledman, that's right.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
M.J. Morgan, I read her school.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
That's right, that was my first school.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Your first school, was it yours?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
No, I went to Cuntida.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Did you go to Cuntida's school?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Was that Cuntida?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
That was my second school.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
That's right, second school.
