00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Farewell, the colliery worker, the muffler and the cab

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Farewell, you're on the valley girls, we never will come back

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The mines they are a-closing, the valleys are all doomed

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
There's no working around, the boys will be in London soon

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
My father was a miner and his father was before him

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And they always had been proud to work below

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Since the balney thro'b and zacks all the lads have got the sack

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And the way to work in England we must go

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Farewell, the colliery worker, the muffler and the cab

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Farewell, you're on the valley girls, we never will come back

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The mines they are a-closing, the valleys are all doomed

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
There's no working around, the boys will be in London soon

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
No more the chapel singing, for that long ago has left us

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
In the public house, no more the miners' song

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
For the population's dropping as the pit wheels are a-stopping

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And I can't afford to stay here very long

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Farewell, the colliery worker, the muffler and the cab

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Farewell, you're on the valley girls, we never will come back

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The mines they are a-closing, the valleys are all doomed

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
There's no working around, the boys will be in London soon

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Three Herbert and three Orchid on a Pandy and Tina

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
With a stradon the tonpentre all of you

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
For we can no longer wait while Parliament debates

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So have fun, farewell, we bid to all of you

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Farewell, the colliery worker, the muffler and the cab

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Farewell, you're on the valley girls, we never will come back

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The mines they are a-closing, the valleys are all doomed

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
There's no working around, the boys will be in London soon
