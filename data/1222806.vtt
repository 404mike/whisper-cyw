00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Tell me about Schnipsen.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
That was here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Yeah, that was in the house here.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In the house here with a field up the road.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I just had this very strong urge that all the Sunday school children,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
if they didn't go to synagogue, and most of them didn't,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
certainly not on the Saturday morning when I took my two,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and although they were a group in the Cheder,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
once everybody spread eagles all over the place,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the Jewish identity would have been somehow lost.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So I decided that I would create a sort of a,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I think it was just once a week in the middle of the week

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
where parents had to bring, or not had to,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
but would willingly bring their children here.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And we would have a theme every, and I'd have people to help me.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And someone from the older community would always provide

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
some kind of delicious cakes and things, and it was lovely.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And this was, do you know what, summer holidays?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Summer holidays, yeah.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So how many children would come here to your house?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You know, a house full?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Yeah, it was a house full.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We had a dining room there, which is now,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
but we used to have the long dining table,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and we used to work on the dining table

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
to do whatever projects was in hand.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I used to have two dogs, and yeah, it was...

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Are the dogs the ones that got the rosettes that are in your window?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Yes, some of them.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Right.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
One of them black, I don't know about blackie.
