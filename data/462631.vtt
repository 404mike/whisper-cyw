00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
The referendum, devolution, actually in 1997 my husband and I were quite involved with politics

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:17.840
and we went on a TV program that was filmed in the Celtic Royal here, the hotel, with Vincent Kane.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.720
I don't think we've heard anything of him for a long time, but he came here and did a program,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.040
you know, a bit like Question Time, you know, where people went along and got their views on that.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.040
The launch of S.W.C. Well, of course, that happened before I came back here,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.880
but I do watch Countdown.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.560
So the devolution campaign, I mean, do you remember what was on television in the run-up to the

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:56.960
referendum in 1997? Well, we watched the political discussions that were on at the time.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:06.080
I can't say I remember a great deal about it. I think not being Welsh, we hadn't known a great

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:13.040
deal about the sort of way things had gone here in Wales. Certainly not until then. I think that

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.760
opened our eyes onto the way things had happened in Wales over many hundreds of years, actually,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.920
you know, because I didn't know a great deal about Welsh history until I came to live here.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:34.240
But we did get involved in that campaign. I mean, I must say we went to this television

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.840
church show with Vincent Kane. Did you stay up to watch the results?

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.760
Oh, yes. Well, yes. My husband and I have always watched, always stayed up to watch

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.000
all the election results. My husband was an agent for, well, I won't tell you which party,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.760
but he was an agent for prospective MPs until he died a couple of years ago.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.800
We were always quite involved in politics.
