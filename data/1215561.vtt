Friends Caroline and Andrea, who went to school together but now live in different towns,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.760
talk about how they stay in touch.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.280
We're phone each other, don't we?

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.280
Yes.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.280
You tried FaceTime, aren't we?

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.280
Yes.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.280
But it doesn't work, does it?

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.280
No.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.280
But we just phone each other every time.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.280
Do you not have a laptop?

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.280
No, my sister won't let me have it.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.280
Don't know why, she's too protective.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.280
Too protective, my sister is.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.280
Your sister's not here.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.280
Yeah, but she's too protective, won't let me have it.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.280
Yeah, yeah.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.280
Do you have Facebook?

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.280
Yeah.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.280
Oh yeah, we do, don't we?

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.280
Yeah.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.280
But I'm not really good at spelling.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.280
But I do try.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.280
Yeah.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.280
Do you talk to each other on Facebook?

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.280
Yeah, we do sometimes, don't we?

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.280
Yeah.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.300
But we mainly phone each other, really, you know.
