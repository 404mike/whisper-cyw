WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
So how often do you see each other then?

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.440
Now this is where we this is what's been hard yes

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.840
Mondays and honestly, yeah Tuesday and hopefully Sundays in the 147. Yep and

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.240
apart from that it's

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.500
difficult

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.120
Not quite what's so difficult then?

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.440
So those are kind of set activities that you do together kind of regular

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.600
Well, I mean I keep it there are other places I go to in the evenings

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.520
I keep trying to get you to come too. Yes

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.720
Wednesday nights

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.040
Yep, I think what sometimes I think what might make it a little bit more difficult

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.200
I think is because we do live quite separate lives

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.880
And like the things like maybe I like

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.920
Doing on particular nights of the week that sometimes like if I've been working on a particular day

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.600
And I literally have been

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.480
slightly longer days working. I'm looking out and about the stuff I come home. I'm just like

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.680
And I'm slumped and like sometimes at the moment. I'm just kind of

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.600
Then I'm like I don't really want to go out tonight. I'm too tired

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.320
What about weekends? Do you meet up on a weekend?

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.600
Sundays usually. Sundays, yes. Our main opportunity. Yeah

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.040
Weekends or Saturday tends to be my quietest day of the week. I

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.480
Think it's at home as well. I probably that's probably the one day in a week

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.960
I feel like I need to stay in because I'm not free much every evening

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.080
I'm a bit like that sometimes as well

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.040
I think like when you have early starts sometimes as well it kind of

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.800
The following day then you feel even more tired because you know you've been

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.440
You know committed to kind of earlier start sometimes

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.320
But then I think we do try to exercise to see each other

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.040
When we can even if it's not enough

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.360
Yeah, I think another issue is

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.760
Distance

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.240
Yeah, Wolf is very central and there's loads of ways to get to four places

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.440
Penturk not quite so. It's true. You've got an hourly bus service at best. Yeah

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.080
That's not always that easy then but like and

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.480
that's kind of why like I

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.160
don't really consider

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
driving something I've never really

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.600
Thought of doing but I that I realize I'm guessing this

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.960
So sometimes like I'll come over to the flat side and we'll spend some time together

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.520
Well, if we go into things that we have been to like things with friends on me and Barry and stuff

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.040
I've gone over to the flat and we've kind of gone from the flat to places

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.320
And then back to the flat to get picked up

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.200
So I quite like that but maybe maybe do not do that as regularly as I should

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.240
Which I'd like to do it more regularly

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.100
And how often do you see each other alone? Would you say?

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.280
Just the two of you yeah, not enough I think this day sometimes isn't it the last time was I want to first

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.280
Yeah

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.920
You went for food

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.720
Let me and one of our friends that we go to for karaoke sometimes was

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.060
karaoke in somewhere else original we went there for that night and that's really nice because

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.320
So you'd like to do that more often would you Simon? Yeah, I think I would as well

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.920
Sometimes I think like

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.760
Maybe it's my bad. We don't do that as often as we should

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.920
But I think you know, sometimes it's like we can have do keep in touch get me out by text and stuff

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.720
Quite a bit

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.940
Maybe not like face to face but even then there's can live

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.000
Like message with me. Yeah

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.720
To you again this

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.040
I know I know cry often I'm slow and replying and the reason for that is

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.140
Again, I just got so much on on the go
