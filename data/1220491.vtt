00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And so, Habernim was a great thing because it enabled you to sort of create something.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.600
And it was self... I mean, the oldest person in Habernim was about 24.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.880
Whereas in the Scouting movement, there were old idiots of 50 and 60, and all men.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.240
Whereas... And the other thing about Habernim, women were plies.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.640
And it doesn't matter whether they were huge, fat, ugly, everyone was loved.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.960
It was quite amazing.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.760
I mean, I can remember too, there was a little woman, she's probably dead now,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.920
and she was a sort of woman no one would look at.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.280
Because she had John Lennon glasses, and she could hardly walk.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.520
But everyone wanted to be with her.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.920
There was another woman who was known as Floppy, because she was a huge, huge woman.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.440
But everyone... They were never left out.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.400
There was obviously the pretty girls who everyone wanted.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.120
And there were some handsome lads who knew everything.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.880
I was never one of those.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.880
But I was a leader, and my group was the young people from about 13 to 16.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.040
Teenagers who knew everything.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.040
And I learned how to manage people.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.480
And it was a very important point in my life.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.760
We were snobs, intellectual snobs.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.560
Because we thought we were left-wing.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.400
We did this, we did that.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.400
We were the intellectuals.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.520
And where was the other lot?

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.440
Cardiff... What was it? CJYS, Cardiff Jewish Youth Society.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.760
Played ping pong, went dancing, off with the girls dancing.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.440
We didn't do these things.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.760
We went camping, and we went kayaking, and we went climbing, etc.
