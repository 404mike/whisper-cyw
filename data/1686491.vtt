WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.740
work when you started work so yeah you're saying about starting work

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:54.000
musicals and you know the technical elements of the stopwatch. So I worked there for a few years. I loved it. Then I went to work in Jacob's for Doolies for Wings. I had my first child when I worked there. I worked right up until I was about to drop.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:12.000
When I left and when she was a few months old I went back because my mother looked after my daughter. And when I was having my son, he was only two years younger than me, I did the same again. So my boss kept taking me back.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I went there again. This is a different matter now. My youngest son is my second son. And I went back after I had the same problem as well. I got on well with my boss but it's not fair anymore. It's all gone, it's all changed on the haze. I don't go to town.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I can't walk around, I can't walk that far anyway. You know I'm going to be old before I wish I could. So I can't walk that far.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I love work. I love work.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Yeah.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Well Dana worked for me. And one of the girls had a few part time jobs and I enjoyed it because of the music and everything. It was like a night out. And Dana's mother, she used to come over and she wanted a drink but she'd come with Carly. Do you know Carly? She used to come with Jolene, Dana's mother.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And that's what I miss about it. I miss all the old people.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Yeah, pubs are different as well aren't they? You know pubs were as much like a community center. I always used to laugh about the old guy in the corner at one pint all night. But everybody was nice to him.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And on a good night you'd have half a dozen pints because somebody would be celebrating and they'd give him a pint.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Yeah of course. That always happened. Like some of my friends would never taste the food in the shop. You know I used to bring them food gum and the lard you know. Make them a couple of cheese rolls.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:51.000
That's the difference isn't it? If those people would now, and you'll know some like it, who are indoors who never go anywhere.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Yes. Well I've become one of those people who goes anywhere. They go to Tesco's or Asda's but there's nothing out there anyway. I'm just waiting for the world to change.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:16.000
But if you go to Tesco's or Asda's, and this is what my nan used to say in the old days, she could go 100 yards down the middle of Barry I Street and take her all afternoon.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Yeah, if he stood up. Yeah, yeah. A lot of old boys used to come down the dark and they used to come to the down street and that.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Well yeah I would have been one of them. I'm 72 this year so I used to spend a lot of time down the bay with the boys Casablanca and other places.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Oh that was a guy for Casablanca. You couldn't see anybody in there. That wasn't a bad thing though.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Oh no, no, it was alright. That wasn't much fun. I'm not the fullest down there but it was a nice year and I would get on with this year.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.000
But people say about atmosphere, some places have got atmosphere because you can't see anything.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000
No, but you've got to create the atmosphere. The world has run in this. You've got to create the atmosphere.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Yeah, you know, and it's another nice picture because there was a few locks we used to go in and come out at 4 o'clock in the morning.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
You know, the shit is lovely. So that's how it goes and we've also got too much down there.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Well there's only one original pub left. What's it?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
That would be The Pocket. Yeah, it's a pub I never liked.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Well I thought Paddle Steam and Oboe's were both good pubs, I have to say.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Yeah, they were. After they were the ones that grew. Oh yeah, yeah. I used to have a lot of good time, honestly.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000
I loved it. It was hard life, man. It's not easy when you're in a pub, isn't it?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000
I love the people. I used to say they're my people, you know. They're my people. And they were lovely.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
But they're not as well-bound.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
But that's a sign of a good landlady, isn't it? You know, they're my people.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So they were. They were causing the problems.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And then some of you wanted to stay on with telemarketing, right? What are you acting like that for?

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
You know, don't spoil yourself and everybody, that type of thing, you know.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Yeah, and it was lovely.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000
But that's the other thing, isn't it? You've got local people wouldn't put up with some types of behavior.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
No, that's right.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
One of the things a lot of young people, a lot of people, I say young people, they're not young now,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
but a lot of people have talked about is things like Chalky White's youth club.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Oh, I remember Chalky. He was a dentist, didn't he? Chalky.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
It's funny, I knew about Chalky White. I never went there.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
But I didn't know his first name until recently, and I never knew he was a dentist.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.000
No, he was a dentist. I don't know, he came down there when Oliver said he was there.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And he was nice, Chalky, wasn't he? I don't know his first name. What's his first name?

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Vivian.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Ah, right, yeah, Vivian. I've known him all my life.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000
It was nice, because he tried to get a son of a cheeky to him as well.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And he was good to the kids there. Yeah, he was on a Chalky.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I think his life story was in Granstown.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
His life and kids.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
But I didn't know that name until recently, right, you know?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Of course, another name that appears a lot, of course, he's, I'm getting old.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Betty Campbell.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Oh, Betty? Oh, yeah.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Oh, yeah, she's a lovely Betty. Yeah, well, she was a couple years older than me.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000
I know all the family, they're nice people, and she was lovely, Betty.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
She did a lot of the community, Betty did.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000
I could get that school book, which was, you know, a giant pillar.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
You know, my school was a school. And also it was nice, Betty.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And she used to teach kids things that they'd have not learned elsewhere about their own backgrounds.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Yes, yes, yes, she'd go into everything, Betty, but she wasn't prejudiced or anything like that.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
She had people friends in her walks, maybe.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
But sometimes you'd get a bit of a reward prejudice.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Yeah.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
But she wasn't. None of us knew her down there, anyway, none of us were prejudiced.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
We just didn't think, we didn't think, any notice.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I mean, that's one of the things people have said about it. It doesn't matter.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.000
There were so many races, so many languages and so many faiths, and yet everyone got on.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Oh, yes, yes. Yeah, they did.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Like, my grandfather could speak about seven languages, but I never learned Egyptian, but they all learned English, didn't they?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000
You know, they are, too. It was a nice place to live, man.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
I feel back to my life as like it was.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Yeah, I know what you mean.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Right.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000
What was it like, I mean, you'll know, what was it like when they started knocking it all down?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Judgment. Judgment. People would look down at the warehouses when they were asked to go out.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
They'd be in the middle of the street, they'd all be looking back down.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
At the warehouse. Yeah.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
I mean, places like Loudoun Square, I mean, amazing place.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Oh, they were fabulous when I was a kid, some of those houses were.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Especially the ones with the steps, haven't you heard me, then?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
They were big, big houses.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Yeah.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
So, it was a nice, it was a good little building.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Yeah, it is. It's just, I mean, one thing that...

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Did you go down the... Sorry, lovely. Did you go down the Chalky Scull?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
No, I didn't, because when I was in Wales, I was in Barrie.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Well, I lived next door to a finale board, and I was in another street.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And they were fabulous, the way you should have it. And now you could be down the floor.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And the same men, when they come on, can see us, they stay there.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Yeah, it's regular, so I came up, and they were lovely, they were gentle.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
But then...

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Yeah, you should show them. Yeah, they were lovely.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
That's one of the things about the Bay as well, isn't it?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:05.000
One of my first recollections of walking with my uncle through the Bay was the smells of food from everywhere.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
From everywhere.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
From everywhere.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
You know, smells all over the world coming out of houses.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Yeah.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Well, my grandkid cooked everything on the mother, and she did for my grandkid.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And she was a fabulous cook.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And my grandfather, he was a cook on the ship when we used to go to sea.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
He was a ship's cook.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
But then he'd come home, and we'd cook home as well, and my grandma used to loan us, and she'd say,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
My matcha darling, Barney, we used to use your fish sauce, and we'd go in the kitchen.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
See, Mr. Disco.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Yeah, it's a funnier difference.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
My nan used to be what I would call a one pot cook.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
It's like we've got all this stuff, all of these root vegetables and everything else,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
they can go in here and we'll make a proper stew.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And other people, I need a pot for everything.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
My nan said, I don't get that.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
No, it goes into...

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Just buy a bath site.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Like, come Christmas and all the while there was no turkeys.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
When I was a kid, it was always chickens.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
I don't know where turkey came from.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
I don't think so.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
I've never ate turkey, ever.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
No.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
My grandfather used to kill about three chickens.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
He'd buy them, young.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And I wouldn't buy them either.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
But they'd feed them there.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And on Christmas, can they jump out of their tree and clean them?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
I wish I'd left this truck in there.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
So my mother had me on Saturday through, too.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
I could never thank God for not being hungry.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I could not.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
But your expectations would have been different as well.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
You know, that thing, I mean, my grandkids do it,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
I'm not having a go at it, but my grandkids do it.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I don't eat that. I don't like that.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Yeah, because you know what it is.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
I'd have starved.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Yeah, but we didn't have lunches, did we?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
No.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Like McDonald's and all the while, I mean, we never had that, did we?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
No.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
The kids, they are the ones who ask me on McDonald's.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
But it was also what you cook.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I mean, we used to eat a lot of mutton.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And now people talk about, you know, and then it was all the fancier lamb joints.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
But we used to eat a lot of mutton.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
You just had to cook it better.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
I only did.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Yeah, and we cooked it slower.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
That's all.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
It tasted like lamb, but it was nothing.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
It was all a guess.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
We had a butter.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
We had a fargin on mutton.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
We only had mutton.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
We don't even change our meat anymore.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
But it's those cheaper joints, isn't it?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
You just got to know how to cook them.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Yeah, you got to cook them up and slow.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Yeah.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Yeah.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Especially with garlic and slow roast.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Yeah.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Like a vegan meal.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
See, that's the thing, isn't it?

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
You can, when you talk about it, you can smell it.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Do you know what I mean?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
It's like I talk about the Nans bread pudding or, you know, as you say, you know, the Welsh cakes.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
I can smell them the minute I think of them.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Yeah, but I'm no bread pudding man again.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Don't tell me that joke because I'll be round your house.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
I've got a thing about bread pudding.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
I can't resist it.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And also, I mean, I'm terrible.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:57.000
If I'm having bread pudding in some cafe or something, as family friends know, I'm just as likely to say, that's not bread pudding.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
That's beautiful.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
They've lost the spices, that's right.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Yeah, you're a puzzle that.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
My nan used to put some nutmeg in.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
What's this?

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Yeah, that makes spice.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Yeah.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Yeah.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Yeah.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
But that's something else all other families had.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
They'd have spice because of who lived there.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000
And, you know, people brought up to cook with spices, not...

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Exactly, I mean, it was brought into the country, wasn't it?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Yeah, it'd come in on the boats, wouldn't it?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
You know, it's...

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Yeah.
