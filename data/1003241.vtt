WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And now if you'll remain standing, we will do the famous one, Cwmrwnda.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Before I do the Welsh words with this, if you've enjoyed singing today, you need to come to our Gwmrwnda on April 23rd at Lake City Presbyterian Church

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
where you can have a whole afternoon of singing, as much as you want.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Cwmrwnda, of course, the favourite.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Eard, of course.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Ddell a gorweddh yn a beddh.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Ddell a gorweddh yn a beddh.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Hóll a lliog. Hóll a lliog.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Hóll a lliog. Hóll a lliog.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Adiw rin am coed i'r lan.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Adiw rin am coed i'r lan.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Let's do the Welsh verse first, and then we'll do the English verse.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And I wouldn't be surprised if we go back to the chorus in the last, so watch out.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Hóll a lliog. Hóll a lliog.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Adiw rin am coed i'r lan.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Adiw rin am coed i'r lan.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Now the English.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Guide me, O, the great Jehovah.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Fill broom through this barren land.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Fill them with the Thou art mighty.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Hold me with Thy powerful hand.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Strong deliverer, strong deliverer.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Be light to my strength and shield.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Be the deep, mild, great and shield.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Strong deliverer, strong deliverer.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Be that to my strength and shield.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Be that to my strength and shield.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Very nice. Thank you.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I wish to say thank you to all those who took part in this program.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
We are always so happy to have it, and always so happy to hear from you people and see you people.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
We will now have an invitation to our key by our president, Martha Smith.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Before I introduce the key, I would like to say thank you to all the jacks and jacks who took part in this program.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
We are always thankful for all the jacks and jacks who took part in this program.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And all of you, thank you.
