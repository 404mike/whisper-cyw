How has your relationship changed over the years since becoming husband and wife?

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.520
Now because we are in here due to cutbacks

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.640
so it's definitely more confined you definitely have to and

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.040
Figure out ways to do things that perhaps you would do outside and

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.880
Work away around it so you can do similar things inside like we have every

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.800
once a week now we have a date night and

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.960
We will do it in this living room. We will watch a film and

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.000
Some nights will get popcorn some nights will get takeaway and

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.120
That's how because we can't go anywhere for a meal or to the audience. That's how we've worked around it

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.840
Because we've had to because we did start to go into a black hole a bit in here and

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.200
and

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.780
It could easily happen again, and I'm trying to fight so hard to stop that from happening

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.840
Being able to be together and to be able to and

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.240
More of each other support each other more often and also just not being on a time constraint

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.880
just being able to

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.160
Hold each other and you know like before we were married you know I mean

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.120
There was never that opportunity to sort of just have a like you know a rest in the morning together after waking up

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.120
What's the worst thing about being married?

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.080
Snoring

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.680
And we killed him the first time we were together
