00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
So do you consider those guys friends or acquaintances?

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.520
Definitely friends, very close.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.520
Okay.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.800
All of them are my mates, but I've only got a handful of my really close mates then.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:19.040
So it's like I buy stuff for his kids, his family, and he does the same for mine and

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.760
what have you.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.760
And he works nights.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.760
So if I'm not working, he'll ring me up like half past four in the morning.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.360
I'm like, oh, cause half past four in the morning, what do you want?

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.360
Like he said, oh, I'm bored in work.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.360
I want something to talk to.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.360
I'm like, oh, fine.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.160
But it's like that.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.880
And if I don't ring him for one day, he thinks there's something wrong.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.880
He's like, oh, what's the matter?

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.880
So you speak every day?

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.880
Yeah, without fail.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.880
Is he your best friend then?

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.880
Yeah.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.880
Yeah.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.120
And did you meet through the rugby club?

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.240
So it was a rugby day and we were just talking.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.880
And when the boys was introduced, well, there was a kid, as I remember, she'd be showing

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.520
me around with the boys and what have you.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.280
And Chris, my best mate, said, oh, good for you.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.680
And I said, no, Chris was going to go at midnight.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.680
He said, no, no, no.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.680
He said, stay out with me.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.680
And I go, right, OK.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.640
So I went out with him about half past two for the game.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.080
We went back to the club for a few drinks and I didn't get home until about a quarter

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.600
to three the next morning.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.760
So since then, we've kind of been friends ever since then.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.960
And I had a ball with his father and I had a dance with like ballroom stuff and presentations

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.380
with his mother.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.880
So it's kind of all in the family.
