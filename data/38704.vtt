00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Dead with the rain we are half-issed away,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
A-plen-ting the ma-ma-i-ta.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Dead with the rain, half-dead with the grief,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We're a-tee-n-ga-sh-tee-w-a-pa-n.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
When in a ma-cl-it I've been tied up down,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And been l-a-me-da-n-on mess-a-nose,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
When a-t-ol-a-ee-dee felt a-dee-a-n-o-a-ee,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
But we ne-buy a-fl-a-t-a-n-a-th-ose.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Dead with the rain we are half-issed away,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
A-plen-ting the ma-ma-i-ta.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Dead you can be, not dead you can be,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
We're a-tee-n-ga-sh-tee-w-a-pa-n.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Te-a-pl-a-n, te-a-pl-a-n, te-a-pl-a-n, te-a-pl-a-n.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Will you unwind it, trigger you're the man,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
In turn, head me aground the moose.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
The bear with silver will you come on the tip-glass,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
A-boy you can walk it ag-nose.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Dead with the rain we are half-issed away,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
A-pl-en-ting the ma-ma-i-ta.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Dead you can be, not dead you can be,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
We're a-tee-n-ga-sh-tee-w-a-pa-n.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Dead with the rain we are half-issed away,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
A-boy you can walk it ag-nose.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Thanks for watching!
