00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800
My name's Jamie Baker and I'm from the Horn Development Association, HDA, which is a project

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:18.680
in Cardiff that works with local communities and in this case working with Heritage, the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:27.280
history of black and minority people in Cardiff, focusing on the 1919 race riots, which we

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.960
call the Year of Revolt. Hopefully you'll grasp that as we go forward. We're funded

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.160
by the Heritage Fund in Wales. Up to now we've developed a number of projects. We've managed

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.160
to create databases and we're glad to share those databases where it will advance knowledge

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.280
and help people undertaking their own family research. Those databases are number one,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:02.960
1900 Somalian Yemeni seamen that served on the UK Merchant Navy, 1918 to 21. 50% of those

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.080
have pictures. Number two, every Welsh-born or Welsh-based seaman that died in World War

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:17.000
II on the UK Merchant Navy. Three, every Caribbean-born seaman that died on the UK Merchant Navy

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.680
in World War II. And number four, every Arab seaman that's from the Gulf of Aden. So Yemeni,

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:31.360
Yemen, Djibouti, Somalia, etc. as we now see them that died on the UK Merchant Navy in World War II.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:38.000
Now we're going to be undertaking some work which is part of nine months funding from the Heritage

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.960
Fund focusing on the race riots in 1919 in Wales. But to understand them we believe you've got to

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.960
link them to UK and worldwide events. The project will be number one to try and show the full

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.960
context of the events in Wales, UK and worldwide. Two, to train volunteers. This is always central

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.160
to what we do. Three, enable local communities to tell their stories about how the families

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:14.600
were affected by the events. Four, tell the story in as available and approachable a way as possible

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:22.520
using podcasts, YouTube channel and People's Collection Wales, Facebook and our own website.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.360
Five, the podcast will be weekly and our hope is that this will enable us to interview people

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:36.920
from all over the world. The intention is to show the global context. And six, never easy,

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:47.480
involve education. Now the race riots in the UK started in January in 1919 in Brumelaw Street,

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.440
Glasgow outside the signing on office where Merchant Seaman signed on to get a ship. And in

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.240
February it was in South Shields that largely involved Yemeni and Somali Merchant Seaman who

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:10.040
were the victims. In March it was a brief fracas in Salford in England. In April it was East London

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:18.120
where the Chinese were the major victims of the attacks. 5th of June it was Liverpool in England

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:26.440
where we had eight days of attacks against black people by a white mob and all of these riots

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.960
were white mobs attacking black and minority people. In Liverpool the most notable and for

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:38.760
many people was the event of Charles Wooden being pursued by a crowd of thousands beaten and thrown

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:46.200
into the River Mersey to drown. 6th of June was when it started in Wales in Newport and then on

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:53.960
the 11th of June it had started in Barry and Cardiff. Now the role of the press in 1919 was

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:03.720
there was no radio that was 1926 it started the BBC or TV the BBC started in 1936 and the press

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.280
set their position on what was happening in Wales. The riots in Barry according to the press started

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:17.000
because quote the black way laid him Fred Longman seized him by the throat pinned him against the

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.680
wall and stabbed him under the heart. In Newport the riots started because quote a coloured man

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.320
accosted a white woman and a soldier intervened. The Cardiff riots were said to have started

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:35.480
because quote blacks in a superior number set upon a lone white man unquote. So the tone was set

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:42.200
blacks are the aggressors and the child's game of whispers begins to be followed by exaggeration.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:49.800
Now a constant theme during this period and previously and also right up until the middle

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:57.720
of the period after the Second World War was sex and protection of the white race was always

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:04.920
part of the mob's chance and justification during 1919. This is a quote from the chief constable of

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:10.760
Cardiff at the time which may say much more about him than it does about the actual context but

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.400
nonetheless white flannels are more revealing than corduroys and make black men more attractive to

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.880
white girls, Cardiff girls, who should not be allowed to admire such beasts. This was the

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:30.680
sight of black men playing cricket in a church league. However there was nothing light-hearted

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:38.520
about the quotes that were also in the press. The chief constable again, the coloured seamen who live

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:45.240
in our midst are not imbued with our moral code and have not assimilated our conventions. They

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.800
come into contact with the female sex of the white race and their progeny are half-caste with

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:59.000
the vicious hereditary taint of their parents. A theme picked up by the western male newspaper.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.400
The sex problem, black men with white women, which obtrudes upon the matter is one with which the

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:12.520
legislative is unlikely to interfere. Such consorting is ill-assorting. It exhibits either

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:20.360
a depravity or a squalid infatuation. It is repugnant to our finer instincts in which pride of race

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:26.200
occupies a just and inevitable place. The only answer at the time from the British government

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:33.800
of Prime Minister David Lloyd George and his minister Winston Churchill was repatriation of

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:41.720
the black and other races back to their countries of origin and they offered them, the repatriates,

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:49.720
two to five pound plus five pound when they landed back home. However, according to those who were

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:56.040
repatriated and sailed on the SS Orca, they never received the money. An estimated three thousand

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:03.080
were repatriated from the UK, including 200 from Cardiff who were put on a boat in Plymouth.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:09.480
According to some writers and academics, the riots were caused by unemployment and poverty.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:17.320
Well, that may be so in their eyes, but how does that explain the over-brutalization of white women

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:25.080
who were stripped and beaten by the mob if it was discovered they were in any kind of relationship

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:31.000
with a black man? The lies published by the press. The fact that the reason the number of

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.120
black and minority people had increased in Cardiff, etc. was because Britain had asked them to come

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:44.200
as they were needed during the war. The only solution offered, as I said, was repatriation.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:49.400
Brutal events across the world that year cannot be explained by unemployment and poverty,

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:57.800
such as the Amritsar massacre in the Punjab in India, legislation to stop freedom of expression

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:07.080
in India and the wave of 37 riots, racial attacks and lynchings being part of them, across America

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:12.520
known as the Red Summer. But in a state of political unrest nationally in the UK,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.720
what happened in places where there were no black or other minorities to blame? Well,

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:24.760
there was still violence and politicians were blamed. For example, Luton Town Hall was burnt

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:31.880
down in July 1919. Let's move forward very briefly. Can it happen again? First, there is a need for

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:37.640
ammunition, then the confidence that, quote, you are on the side of the right, and then there is

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:44.840
the mob. Well, the UK has had a referendum to decide whether it would be part of the European

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:52.360
Union or it would be totally independent. And the newspaper headlines that, as we considered whether

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:58.120
to leave Europe, well, some of those have been the subject of press complaints investigations.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:07.080
And since 2015-16, when these press were covering and encouraging people to leave Europe,

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.960
there has been a 10% increase in racial discrimination, according to surveys,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:18.760
and a significant rise in all types of hate crime, from attacks on disabled people through to

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:25.880
attacks on lesbian, gay and trans people. Just to quote some headlines,

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:33.800
The Sun, November 2015, one in five British Muslims have sympathy for jihadis.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:43.000
The Daily Express, July 2016, migrant crisis, sort it now, new home secretary urged to get grip

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:51.480
on borders. The Daily Star, Sunday, 4th of September 2016, one of the most infamous murderers

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:58.200
in Britain's history, the Yorkshire Ripper, Sutcliffe, his surname was, was mentioned.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:06.280
Yorkshire Ripper turns to Islam. Muslims protect Sutcliffe in jail. The Daily Express, 3rd of August

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:15.880
2016, EU's migrant crisis is colossal. The Express website, 23rd of May 2016, the National Health

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:21.560
Service will be 10 billion in the red in three years time, creaking under weight of migrants.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:31.000
Daily Express, 16th of May 2016, soaring cost of teaching migrant children, £3 billion bill,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:41.320
another reason to quit EU. The Daily Express, 12th of November 2015, 75% of new jobs go to EU

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:48.520
migrants in one year. Mail online, report shows the NHS is nearly at breaking point as massive

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:56.600
influx of EU migrants forces doctors to take on 1.5 million extra patients in just three years

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:06.600
and migrants spark housing crisis. Now many of those comments were investigated by the

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:13.320
Press Complaints Authority and some were found to be based upon no facts at all and some were

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:22.680
found to be based upon facts that actually didn't say what the paper said. Retractions in the British

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:30.520
press are never made on the front page so page seven, page eight, etc you would see an apology

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:36.040
some time later. Now one of the questions we've been asked is why does forgotten

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:43.480
history need to be told? This is a quote from Martin Nymuller that I was taught when I was a child.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:49.480
First they came for the communists and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a communist.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:56.280
Then they came for the trade unionists and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a trade unionist.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.760
And then they came for the Jews and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a Jew.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.960
And then they came for me and there was no one left to speak out for me,

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:15.560
Pastor Martin Nymuller. And as Edmund Burke said, those who don't know history are destined to

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:21.000
repeat it. Now many stories are forgotten by history and ignored in our classrooms. Hopefully

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:29.240
by telling this story in more detail over eight or nine months we can show the global picture of

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:36.680
the First World War and the allies fear of revolution. How that affected non-white people

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:44.760
globally and how that affected Wales. It is important to understand fear of communism

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:57.400
and Bolshevik uprising and the trade unions and for the first time a potential global perspective

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:06.920
amongst ordinary people, particularly those who were working people and soldiers, merchant navy,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:19.880
etc. who were returning from war was a common concern across all of the democratic nations.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:27.480
My name is Jamie Baker. I represent HDA Cardiff and this was recorded in June 2019,

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:36.840
which is the anniversary month of the riots in Wales. We will follow this with a number of

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:43.240
related stories which will be more detailed about individual events and individual places.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:57.800
Hopefully you'll contact us if there is a part of this story you can contribute to. Thank you.
