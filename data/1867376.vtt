WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360
Okay, this is the first oral history to be done for the Project 6 People to Collections

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.960
Ellen Lynx Landscape Partnership Programme.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.320
I'm Stephanie Cruz, the Ellen Lynx Cultural Heritage Officer, and we're here in the Ellen

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.120
Lynx office at the Agents House in Ellen Village.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.760
It's the 3rd of October and I have with me Howard Sandilands of Casagobnia Prestine.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.360
Howard, thank you very much for coming in.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.360
Pleasure.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.920
And we're going to talk about some photographs that you sent me in, but just before we can

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.200
kick off on those, if you could just tell me a little bit about your family, your parents,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.200
what they did.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.560
Well my parents were married in 1937 and I was born in 1946 in London.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.160
I have a brother who's three years older and we grew up in London.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:56.000
My father had his own business which was started by my grandfather.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.280
I spent my childhood years and my school years in London before moving to basically

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.520
Worcestershire as a pre-college student before I went to agricultural college.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:18.040
And then after college I spent a year abroad in Africa coming back to join an American

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.720
company in the agricultural industry.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:32.960
And I stayed with them and their successors until 2007 when I retired on disability.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.160
I'm guessing from your accent you might have spent a little bit of time in America.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.160
35 years.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.160
Yes.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.160
Yes, 35 years.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.760
So I enjoyed every minute of it.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.760
Good.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.160
And what brought you back?

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:54.360
Well my late wife died in 2005 and subsequently I met an old friend who I actually had met

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.400
in Worcestershire during my pre-college practical days and she'd been on her own for many years

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.200
and we got married in late 2008.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.720
Lovely.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.640
We were living in America at the time.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.800
She's English and I dragged her to America.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.760
But for one reason or another which I won't go into, we decided that we would spend our

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.800
retirement years back in the UK.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.440
So I returned to the UK finally two years ago.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:38.560
We'd previously purchased an old stone barn in Kasgov back in 2010 and we converted that

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.760
and that is where we're currently living.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.760
Lovely.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.760
Lovely.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.760
Yeah.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.400
So what was it that you sent me in?

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.720
Pictures of your parents and a visit to Ellen Valley when you were approximately how old?

00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:00.680
Well it was probably about 1957 and I can date that because of what I looked like at

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.680
that time.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.680
Yeah.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:11.680
It's an odd story because back in 2012 my wife Mary and I thought we'd come out to

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.320
Ellen Valley, a glass of coffee and have a look around and as we drove from the visitor

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:27.080
centre around the reservoir I suddenly stopped the car because I said to her, I've been here

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.600
before.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.880
It was just one of those moments when you visualise all those years ago when you were

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.040
a child that you'd been here.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.040
You didn't know exactly when.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.600
And I looked and there was a little parking space with a waterfall and that is one of

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.920
the photographs that I'm showing you here.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:58.600
And then as I looked down the road I saw, which is probably the memory I had of the

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.640
reservoir with a little cottage on the hillside.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:11.600
And I can remember at the time we spent probably a couple of hours at this particular spot

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.600
and some photographs were taken but I couldn't remember exactly which ones they were.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.120
But I knew that my mother had sat on a rock somewhere by the waterfall.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.720
I remembered that.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:31.520
So we took some photographs and when I got home some weeks later I sorted through all

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:39.080
the old photographs from the family and it was just an amazing fact because it's almost

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.080
exact.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.080
It's almost exact.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.080
Absolutely.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.280
There's a photograph taken, my mother and my father, my mother sitting on this rock

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:56.680
where I had sat and the other photograph which you can see here, which is of me standing

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.760
by a piece of walling was actually in actual fact where my mother stood beside the car

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.480
we had some 60 years before.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:16.240
So it was one of those moments that I'm sure everyone has.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.440
They can go back into their childhood and their memories in their childhood are normally

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.960
more distinct than they were yesterday.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.640
They certainly are for me.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.220
So that's really the story behind the photographs.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:37.960
We came back to Wales subsequently probably for the next three or four years as a family

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.400
until my brother was old enough to do what he wanted to do.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:49.040
I know that I came back with my parents probably when I was 14 but we would come to the Allen

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.800
Valley and we would also go to Valor and Trorsfinnid on our way to Snowdonia.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.800
Right.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:02.560
Where we spent a number of pleasant holidays in that area.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.560
And was the sun always shining?

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.560
No, the sun was not always shining.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.560
Well, it is Wales.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.040
Not always shining at all.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:18.000
But yes, and now we come back to Allen Valley.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.820
Probably three or four times a year we came back I think the last time earlier this year

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.740
we decided to have a picnic at the place with that little waterfall and park the car and

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.260
walk down the road and over the stile.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.540
There's a stile now by that little parapet.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.540
We now have a dog.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.220
So the idea was to bring the dog and we came early in the morning.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.580
It was the worst thing we could have possibly done because there were more gnats around

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.260
than anything.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.920
But it's a lovely place to come.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:54.440
The interesting thing that I do remember is that there was no traffic then.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.440
Yes.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.280
We were probably the only car, maybe one or two more.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.080
The visitors car park wasn't as full as it is during midsummer and this would have been

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.960
taken in probably August time, July or August.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.200
The roads were obviously much narrower.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.760
Very, very little traffic.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.760
Actually quite pleasant.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.760
Yes.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.280
And what kind of car is it that your father drove?

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.960
That was a little standard 10.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.440
I don't know the name.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.440
Who made those?

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.440
Standard Triumph.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.440
It became Standard Triumph.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.440
Yes.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.560
And was that the first car that you remember having?

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.560
No, no.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:45.720
The first car he had after the war was an Austin 10 and I do remember taking that to

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:52.040
Cornwall or being in it in Cornwall during very, very bad weather.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.560
And my brother and I spent most of the time mopping water which was coming through the

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.560
back windows.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:02.080
So there we are.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.960
So now you sort of like drive up around the valley?

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:13.920
Yes, we drive around the valley and up and over the top and come back into Raida.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.400
We have in actual fact gone towards Aberystwyth but the road is very narrow.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.400
Over the top road.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.400
Over the top road.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.400
Yes.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.400
Lovely drive.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.960
But we don't try and do it in August or July.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:33.040
Normally in the spring or the fall.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.080
So are there any other memories of the valley that you have?

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.360
Any of the dams?

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.360
Yes.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.080
Each of them you remember.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.080
As children we would obviously get out of the car and walk where you could walk across

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.160
the dam and peer over.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:59.040
But because it's so long ago sometimes you get confused with which dams you actually

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:04.800
went across because there are a number of dams obviously in this valley but there's

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.440
there's less I believe in Baller and in Shor's Fenny because this one's on more of a different

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.920
levels whereas the others were just flooded.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.240
Yes, it's the series of them.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:21.920
The interesting thing when you look at these photographs though, I mean apart from the

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:31.480
waterfall but if you look at this what I find fascinating is that a lot of the trees that

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:39.720
were there 60 years ago were already mature and today although there is more vegetation,

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:45.920
more trees it's still very much distinguishable.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.080
That's the same place obviously.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.080
It is.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:59.000
And I did take another photograph of the little cottage here which is not very distinct but

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.800
it is exactly the same.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.640
It hasn't changed one iota on the hillside there.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:11.880
And unfortunately with only being new in post I'm not sure where the location is in terms

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.240
of naming the dam and the cottage.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:22.400
Well this is if you look on the map it's the extension it's quite some distance from the

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.840
visitor centre.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.000
So it's actually goes round and stops.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.640
Right, I shall get an expert on that.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.600
Or you can try it down there you can actually see the waterfall.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.080
Go and see where it is.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.960
But you're absolutely right the cottage itself which is visible in both the photographs looks

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:47.720
exactly the same and whilst the foreground of the cottage is a little bit more, sort

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:53.880
of like it has more trees in it now, it does, just the whole landscape is still exactly

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.880
the same.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:55.880
It's great.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:01.040
You know you can go to some places that you visited many many years ago and you just think

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.520
is this the same place because the vegetation has grown, trees have grown, people have changed

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:10.600
houses and put extensions on or they've been pulled down and rebuilt.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.200
But here there is no question.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.760
No absolutely not.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:23.440
And I have to say the picture of your mum and dad at the waterfall that is by repute

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.360
one of the places that everybody is very fond of.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.360
Oh absolutely.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.360
Yeah.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:34.720
I think it's a lovely little spot and it always looks really peaceful and a lovely place to

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.720
actually sit.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:40.480
So did you in your younger days, did you have picnics and things when you?

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.480
Oh yes.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.480
There was always picnics.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:49.600
We'd go to some little, I suppose they probably weren't called delicatessens at the time,

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:55.280
but little local shops and pick up some bread and cheese and various things.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.640
And we'd normally have a flask of coffee or tea.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.640
I don't know.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.800
I've never drank coffee in those days but I probably drank something.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.800
And we would have a picnic.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.800
Yes.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:12.040
I mean most of our holidays in those days were going to and staying in bed and breakfast.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:19.000
And we wouldn't travel great distances but within a two week trip we might stay at four

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.400
or five places.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:29.680
But we did find in Snowdonia at the bottom of the Glanberis Pass a farmer.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.440
His name was Hughes Jones and we stayed with them.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:38.120
My mother stayed with them for many years afterwards after we'd grown and left home.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.560
As it started off as a bed and breakfast and became very good friends so we'd stay with

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.560
them.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:49.360
But most of them were people that we'd just stay a night or two nights.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.160
Because it's quite a journey from London up in those days.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.160
Oh yes, yes.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:13:02.440
We used to start off about two o'clock in the morning.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.440
And then travel up.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.920
Sleep a lot of the way then.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.960
Yeah, sleep a lot of the way.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.120
Good days.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.480
Great memories as children.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:19.520
We were very fortunate because to have a car and to just be able to travel.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:26.720
We saw a lot of southern England as I said before particularly the southwest and all

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.720
Wales.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.400
Oddly enough we never went to South Wales until I was probably a little bit older.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:39.400
I can remember probably the first time we went to Pendean Sands and that area was when

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:44.040
I was 14 or 15.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:49.560
But I think we covered every single piece of coastline between Portland and Bill.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:55.640
All the way round, all the way up to Western Supermair and the same in Wales.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:00.440
From the other side of Cardiff or the other side of Swansea.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.960
All the way round the bay.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.520
And spent a lot of time in Snowdonia.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:13.320
The nice thing about Wales for us as children was that they had railways, narrow gauge railways.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:21.080
The Bay of Vardong, Welshpool, Lanfair, Taddef Lynn and then up in Snowdonia you could get

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.320
into the slate quarries then and they'd show you around and they had their little steam

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.560
engines for hauling the slate.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:32.480
So that was a big interest for my brother and myself.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.120
We used to have a railway when there was a bit of a down.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.120
That's right.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:41.920
A lot of people don't know about that but it goes all the way down the side of the valley.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:48.040
And you've got some lovely photographs of the dams when they were almost just jointed

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:51.800
on the side, the railway track, when they were actually building it.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.600
Yes, they've got some pictures up in the office.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.280
But yes.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.800
Well thank you very much for that Howard.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.640
It's been really interesting talking to you and most grateful for the photographs and

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.640
for you coming in.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.400
Thank you very much.
