00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What are your earliest memories of television?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.600
Very earliest is having the television installed,

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.440
which must have been about 1949,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.000
because we lived in London at that time.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.080
I'm not being particularly interested

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.080
until round about the early 1950s

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.480
when I started paying attention to the news programmes.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.480
On the news programmes,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.480
one that continues to stand out

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.480
was the funeral of King George VI.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.480
And they showed

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.480
some of the service and the processions.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.480
The incident that stands out

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.960
was taking the coffin by rail

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.960
to Windsor for burial.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.960
Station platform

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.960
and the guards bringing the coffin to go on the train.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.960
And the royal ladies,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.960
three queens,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.960
Darja Queen Mary,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.960
Queen Elizabeth,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.440
and at that point the Queen Mother,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.440
and the young new queen,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.440
Elizabeth II,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.440
with her sister, Princess Margaret.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.440
They stood in a group as a reception

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.440
to watch the coffin going on to the train.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.440
They're dressed in black

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.440
and they're all wearing long black veils.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.440
Shrouded.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.440
And I can't remember what the commentator said.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.440
I just remember the picture.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.440
After that,

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.440
school must have been very, very keen

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.440
that we watched the news.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.440
Perhaps the nuns had got a television in their convent

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.440
and were allowed to watch the news as well.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.920
And I remember Fife Robertson

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.920
with his clip Scottish speech

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.920
going on a hunt for the Loch Ness Monster.
