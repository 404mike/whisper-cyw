00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
My name's Peter Tyndall. I'm currently the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner in Ireland.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And I was at first a social worker and then coordinator with CUS when it first professionalised.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:25.000
When I joined CUS, it would have been early 80s, I'd say, late 70s, early 80s, Group Home was established.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000
In English, the five residents had moved from the hospital into the student house in Rith and Gardens.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And at the time, there was some transition in place from having student volunteers to gradually seeing more community service volunteers come in at that point.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The original founding volunteers had moved on by then.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So the people who were there were subsequent to those. At that time, CUS had two other projects still working.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:19.000
One of them was the original Ely Hospital project, where students took a group of people from the hospital out into the community on Wednesday afternoons for social activities.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And also by then, the short stay house at Hamilton Street had been set up.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Both the group home had a full time organiser, which was the job I originally took. I was called a social worker.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And then the short stay has also had a full time member of staff.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And there was one administrative staff member at that time, still based in the Students' Union, had an office in the Students' Union next to Student Community Action, SCA at the time.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So everybody's name has changed since, of course.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000
During the time I was there, the All Wales Mental Handicap Strategy, as it was called, was developed.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And at that stage, it was clear to all of us that a long term solution, living with students in a student house, would stop being age appropriate for the residents.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The ethos at the time, particularly on the committee, which was very active, would have been driven by what at the time was known as normalisation, subsequently social role valorisation and so on.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And the general view was that people should be able to lead lives as valued members of their communities and that they needed support in order to do that.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:03:04.000
The inconsistency of support that the regular changeover of volunteers caused was seen in the long run as not being desirable or beneficial.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
People needed a more stable and secure support network.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And consequently, with the Mental Handicap Strategy funding, as it was, we were able to get full time staff to support the residents in the group home and to run the short stay house at Hamilton Street and to develop a community employment project or a social education project, as it was,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
which subsequently developed into the mainstream work of the Innovate Trust.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So there was continuity there.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000
CUS took a decision that it didn't want to be a large scale provider at that time.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:08.000
It took the view that it preferred to have, if you like, an influencing role and that it would run its own projects, but that it wasn't going to turn into, for instance, the provider of accommodation for people at Ely Hospital.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:33.000
You'll have in the history the story about the inquiry by Geoffrey Howe into Ely Hospital, how that led to the scandal at Ely Hospital, which in turn caused students within the university who were engaged with some of the residents at the hospital to try and do more direct to actually improve the lives of the people there and to demonstrate that they didn't need to be hospitalised.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:56.000
So at that point, it was, CUS was highly active in, so I should say as well, that when CUS reorganised with professional staffing, it was decided to move to having a single person running the organisation, reporting to the board.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And I took on that job at the time as coordinator, things like that, chief executives would have been regarded as probably two establishment for CUS at the time.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And so we did a lot of work promoting the development of community-based services in Wales and in developing two of the major charities that provided support and accommodation.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And they changed names and so on over time.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:48.000
But Opportunity Housing Trust was the one founded largely at the behest of CUS to support people in the Cardiff and South Lomorgan, as it would have been, area at the time.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And Cotrevi Cymru, jointly with Mencap to cover the rest of Wales.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:09.000
So people from CUS were involved in all of the programmes that developed for hospital closure, for developing the charitable infrastructure that underpinned the community-based services.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Also for some of the standard settings.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:23.000
So, for instance, I worked on the original standards for community living that were issued as part of the mental handicap strategy.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:35.000
I was one of the co-authors of that with Peter Cahill from then he would have been Gualia Housing, but he went on to be Cardiff Community, chief executive of Cardiff Community Housing Association.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:47.000
So CUS was very actively involved in developing mainstream services for people with intellectual disabilities, but it wasn't itself committed to being a major service provider.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
So that probably is an overview of my time at CUS.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Now, the individual residents at that time, we would have done things like looked at their level of social activity and so on.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:12.000
They actually had very disproportionately high levels of social activity between volunteers and the house was quite well supported.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
They led quite rich lives.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Initially, they still attended a day centre, Traleigh Day Centre, though over time we kind of started to develop community-based alternative day activities for people.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And sadly, over time, as well as people got older, particularly one case, their disability became, their physical disability became more pronounced.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And then, as you well know, subsequently they were able to move on to more self-contained accommodation rather than living permanently as a group.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000
During my time there, one of the residents returned home to her family in Swansea.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Well, Adrian Roper, the head of Catrevy, worked briefly at CUS, having been a volunteer student in the house as well.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Catrevy Cymru, the board, it was Rex Hewitt and Mencap Cymru at the time and myself who worked on developing Catrevy Cymru from scratch.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:29.000
It was obvious that there needed to be a new Wales-wide body because Opportunity Housing Trust was specifically dealing with that.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:40.000
With Coord of Opportunity Housing Trust originally was called Interval Housing Trust, though that name was lost fairly quickly.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:09:00.000
But when the decision was taken by the board at CUS that it wanted to say small and agile could be, in a sense, trying to drive progress rather than engaging with the authorities as a service provider, which would have entailed a different kind of relationship,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Then we did the work on putting a board together which had representatives of families, which had people from social services and so on.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:27.000
It is worth saying the way the mental handicap strategy worked, there was a county at that stage, social services were provided by the eight counties in Wales, so it would have been South Lomorgan, covering what's now Cardiff and the Vale of Lomorgan.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:43.000
There was a planning group set up to cover that area. I was very actively involved with it. I also, at the time, chaired South Lomorgan Interval, which is the council of voluntary service for the county.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:10:10.000
So I was well placed, CUS was quite well placed through being involved in these various networks and to start to put a new organisation together so that the things like developing the constitution, the company status for it, all the rest of those things, chargeable status, would have been done from the CUS offices at the time.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:32.000
The late Gary By, who died last year, very sadly, but this year, was the administrator at CUS at the time, and he did a lot of the work in the practical groundwork in creating the legal structure and financial basis and employment and so on for those organisations.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:48.000
So CUS didn't just run its own projects and then develop into it. It actually was the driver of an awful lot of changes that happened in intellectual disability in Wales in the 80s.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Yeah, I was at CUS for the best part of seven years, and because it was developing and because intellectual disability services were developing, that was a very good time to be there. There was optimism, there was money, there was a lot of principle, you know, people.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And within government, there were within the civil service, there were people who were very to drive things forward, and within local government, so to be around. After that, I became the housing officer, as it was then called, with Ty Cymru, the body that funded and regulated housing association in Wales.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:49.000
So we developed a policy there for shared housing, you know, put the group home model was established at the time as the way to go. I think nowadays you'd be looking to more individual person centred rights based approaches, but you have to within the context of its time, Wales was very radical.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And so we put funding in place for the requirement maximum of four people had to be fully integrated and so on, so that the planning has to account the individuals.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And there was a big rollout of housing activity while I was at Ty Cymru for people with intellectual disabilities, as well as for people from other groups who needed support, we put in place a revenue grant scheme as well, which helped, you know, organisations like Kertrevian Opportunity Housing Trust, as they were being established.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And I would have in that context worked across Wales with the Individual Services and Health Board development of alternative community based provision.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:44.000
In retrospect, it all went quite well as speedy at the time, it was quite frustratingly slow and took a lot of negotiation.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:13:06.000
There were a lot of people who'd been brought up in the old services and who had a very patronising view of people with intellectual disabilities, suing them, community based service could and would work and not only persuading them of that, but making them part of delivering it was quite a challenge and quite a challenge too with some parents.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:19.000
There was some very, very articulate family advocates for change. So I was, you know, they were helped to bring other families along.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:32.000
After I was at Ty Cymru, I went and worked with council and assistant director of housing there, had responsibility for homelessness services, for services for older people, for the housing waiting list and a whole variety of other things.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:45.000
My job grew, kept growing, I kept acquiring new responsibilities and went from there to the Welsh Local Government Association, where I was head of education and culture.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And then to the Arts Council of Wales, where I was chief executive before becoming the public service ombudsman in Wales.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:09.000
I did that for the best part of seven years old. So one particular case with a gentleman called Paul Ridd, who died unnecessarily in Hossle, a gentleman from Port Talbot with intellectual disabilities.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:26.000
The office, myself as ombudsman, did a very critical report on the care he had because of his intellectual disability, people didn't understand how ill he was and he didn't receive the treatment that would have saved his life.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And since then, the Paul Ridd Foundation has been set up, which I'm very pleased about his family have been great campaigners and intellectual disability liaison nurses were put in place in all of the general hospitals in Wales so that those kind of communications difficulties shouldn't have arisen again.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Unless you're vigilant, you fix something once, but whether it stays fixed is another matter.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:07.000
My current job, I'm ombudsman and information commissioner in Ireland. I'm from Ireland originally, as you can tell.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:18.000
I went to work in Wales. I went to Cardiff originally on route to London, stopped off to visit somebody and then worked there for more than 30 years.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:27.000
So I've got a strong links with Wales and, you know, my daughters continue to live in Wales to this day.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:43.000
So I do keep an eye on how things are going there. And I think it's one of the challenges that that's faced is that clearly at the time that I was engaged in services, we were switching from an institutional model.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:56.000
To a model to a community based model and subsequently that change. We've seen the change through to a much more person centred model of supporting people.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:10.000
My worry is now that the purchasing approach has commercialized that to some extent and that the kind of quality of life and the quality of life that we have in the country.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Of life and being for people with intellectual disabilities, been able to live not just within their communities, but as engaged valued members of those communities is not something that we can take for granted.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:40.000
And I hope that people working in services in Wales, and I'm sure that they are the successors of CUS continue to campaign to make sure that the services that are delivered give people the opportunities in life that they deserve.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:48.000
I would have been in and out of the house. They would have been in and out of the office. We'd go out for meals together to the beach, whatever, you know, it was.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:59.000
They, as I say, had a very active life and even though I was paid rather than the volunteers, I was still very engaged with them and they enjoyed their company.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Alan was very cross with me because during our time there in recent years before his death, I had done a video and of course at the time the terminology was mental handicap.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:19.000
And so when the video was reused, Alan would always say, why do you call me handicapped in the video?

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Thinking very difficult to explain. Alan Alan actually interviewed me for the job as part of the interview panel.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
When I first got the job, Alan sat in on the on the interview.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:46.000
So even in those days that that would have been, I think, absolutely unprecedented in the UK at the time to have a person with intellectual disability actually engaged in a recruitment process.
