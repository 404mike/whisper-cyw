00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
A Little Boy Lost from Songs of Experience by William Blake

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Read by Dudley Sutton for the BBC

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Nor loves another as itself, nor venerates another so,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Nor is it possible to thought a greater than itself to know.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And, Father, how can I love you or any of my brothers more?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I love you like the little bird that picks up crumbs around the door.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The priest sat by and heard the child. In trembling zeal he seized his hair.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
He led him by his little coat and all admired the priestly care.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And standing on the altar high, lo, what a fiend is here, said he,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
One who sets reason up for judge of our most holy mystery.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The weeping child could not be heard. The weeping parents wept in vain.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
They stripped him to his little shirt and bound him in an iron chain,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And burned him in a holy place where many had been burned before.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The weeping parents wept in vain. Are such things done on Albion's shore?
