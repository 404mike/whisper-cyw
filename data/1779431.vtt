WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
going to turn this on. So this is on. So I'm just going to say my name is Marcia Omani

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:14.000
and I'm with Stephanie Davis, Kristin Delivia Davis, Olivia Baker Jones and we are at Stephanie's

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:24.160
home in Rumney or at Marshfields. Oh it's Rumney in this area. Yes, yes. And it's Monday the 25th

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:32.240
of February 2019 I believe. I think that's a date. Okay then Stephanie, first of all thank you so much

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.880
for allowing me to come to your home today. Oh sure. And so what were you christened as?

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:49.200
Let me see, Olivia Stephanie Baker Jones but I was always called Stephanie. They didn't seem to use

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:59.680
the other. My father had the name Baker, he was a Baker Jones. Yeah. But I was born

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:09.440
just down the road from here, across the main road and into Hendra Road. Yeah. And there was a house

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:20.960
there that we lived in. It was called Hendra Vach and they, my, I think when my parents got married

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:28.640
they moved in there and my father did the place up but I think they only lived there. Well it must

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.800
have been about a year because I can remember asking my mother, how old was I when we moved to

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:43.600
the farm in Rumney and she said I was 12 months old. Gosh. So initially I don't remember too much

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:53.680
about the house. We moved over into the farm, upper Newton Farm it was called in Rumney and

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:03.440
we moved in there. It must have been, what let me see, doing about 1929, 1930.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.400
Must have been. Do you remind me asking how old you are Stephanie? I'm 90.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.360
Only recently 90 this past last year. Goodness you don't look 90 do you?

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.360
No. I say to people don't remind me. I just have.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.400
But yes we moved. I can't remember too much of my early childhood down there

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:45.280
because I'd been so young moving in there. I must have been a year old and we lived,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:54.880
because this was just before the war you see as well and I had my parents, we had a,

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.960
they had another child. My sister was born four years after me you know. What was her name? And

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:14.160
we lived, lived down in the farm then and it was not too much to do really.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:23.280
It was, my father hadn't had, he used to live, the family, there's a farm down in St. Melonshire

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.600
that where the family lived. He lived there with his parents and what was it three brothers and

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:42.480
his sister and he started a bit of farming then. What was your father's name? Wilfred, Wilfred Baker

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:50.880
Jones. So he comes from, he came from farming stock? Yes, yes his parents, yes my grandparents

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:59.600
grandfather was farming down there. Is where the way you come up now down the road and up here

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.840
there's a big house called Teecock and that was the family home.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:13.280
And I spent a lot of my childhood down there. At your grandparents farm? And what? At your

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:22.880
grandparents farm. Oh yes, yes, yes. It wasn't huge I don't suppose. The house was big but then

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.200
all the land was down there because it's all been built on now you see, there's all masses of houses

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.760
everywhere. So I was just looking at the view just now and it's been developed. What did it look like

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.640
when you were a child, if you were stood here as a child? Well I can't remember too much as a child

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:52.160
but I know when we first came here we moved in here about 1960s, Cathy was born that year.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:05:04.320
There was of course there were hardly any houses then you just looked out, it was just a lot of

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.520
fields but since in the past 60 years it has been built on quite a lot you know.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:22.000
And even above the road down it's a main road now but when we moved in it was a very narrow

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.160
country lane. What's it really? I can't believe that you know it's all built up now.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:37.680
Yeah. So tell me about your grandparents farm. What did they do, what did they farm? Oh it was

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:47.200
oh it was just cows milking herds really that was all, I don't know whether.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:54.320
There was a market garden as well? Yes there was a market garden I was just going to say that

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:08.000
and my father he was the eldest of the children and he left school I think as young as 12 or 14

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:18.000
because and then he used to he used to I think he must have had started up a milk around from there

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:32.240
and used to go round with a horse and cart, chins of milk and around here not so much not here really

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.640
I mean you know where we are now there was absolutely nothing here I mean this was this

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:45.840
ground here where the all these houses are it was fields and we used to make

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:53.200
my father used to come up here hay making you know really yeah it was just a field

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.400
and there was just one

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:05.040
it was a big house up the top which some a couple lived it was a brother and sister

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:14.000
oh it was the name Davis I can't remember though let me see

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:14.720
let me see

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:26.960
yes a brother and sister that lived in a big house up the top and eventually of course this

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:33.840
land belonged to them and bit by bit they sold it all the houses you know but

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:47.120
yes and down well I suppose the actual time on the farm has got to be the one down in Rumney

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:56.240
that's your father's farm yes my father's farm upper Newton farm it was there were three farms

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:07.280
together upper Newton middle Newton lower Newton and so you upper Newton was elevated you could

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:14.080
see well it was the first one that came you came to it was all on the flat really but it was just

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:21.120
the day with the first ones I forget who owned the land I'm trying to think that yes it was I

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:29.200
was just going to say to do with Tredegar House so was he a tenant farmer or did he buy well he was

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:41.360
he was a tenant farmer yes to start off with and eventually then he did get to to own it

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:49.200
it was a lot a lot of the farms were all being sold off you know eventually

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:59.120
but it was a long way out from the local village or to get anywhere was it oh it was

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:11.520
we were you know we had no transport in those days we had bicycles we cycled everywhere or we

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:19.440
everywhere or we walked everywhere I suppose it must have been a couple of miles from there

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:25.040
up into the village of rumney that was our nearest village and

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:36.400
we'd go there any shops or shopping we did or the church we went to was all in rumney you know

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:42.240
but it wasn't huge because it was

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:51.360
well just before the war really you know that's all I remember a bit before I can remember

00:09:52.720 --> 00:10:03.040
during the war I can remember standing out on the yards in the in the at the farm

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:12.400
at the farm at in the evenings or at night time and listening to the the german planes going over

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:22.320
really and the search lights working there was a search light battery in one of the fields nearby

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:31.840
yeah and then another lot there was a a gun emplacement you know in another they parked

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:42.080
them around all the farms down there you know but it was only I mean it wasn't a huge farm because

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:52.080
my father had maybe 10 or 12 cows that he'd have to milk every day well then he had a horse and cart

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.000
and he had a milk round and he

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:06.800
had I often wondered what time he got up to milk in the morning to get it done so that he could

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:13.120
take it out on the milk run because he very often used to give me a lift up to school in rumney so

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:21.840
it must have been earliest what on the horse and cart in the yes really gosh yes I from the farm

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:27.120
I'd ever lift up into the village he dropped me off in the village and then I'd walk the rest of

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:37.600
the way then to school and so would he have a churn on the cart and you have a jug yes he did

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:46.160
yes there were no milk bottles in those days it was a churn churn full of milk as you say

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:53.440
um that had a it was a measuring can that he used to use and um

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:04.080
very often when he'd go then he I think he may have had a few customers in rumney but then used

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:11.920
to go on across to what is now oh the main road through into the roth area

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:21.040
had a lot of customers around there and of course what he did as you said he had a thing

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:32.000
a measuring thing that he would uh scoop up the milk from the churn and um people would bring

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.240
either bring their jugs out or bring a basin for that matter and he filled the basin up gosh

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:44.800
and certainly when I can remember that what about your mother what was her name

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:55.360
oh olive olive olive yes where did they meet your she didn't well I'm not so sure I have I

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:02.320
remember asking friends but I think they met up at what I would think would be the local

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:12.160
tennis club oh yes the 10 in rumney my mother was from rumney my father was a melons yeah

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:18.960
and I think the two got together the tennis club you know goodness so is that quite an active club

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:26.880
I think it must have been I didn't know too much about it but uh yes was she from a farming family

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.360
no she didn't she actually was born in bristol

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:38.480
and she had two sisters and they were born in bristol and they all used to live in uh

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:47.360
what was a cottage a place over in rumney that is only recently closed down as the local doctor's

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:54.560
place but um her parents now my grandparents they were from rumney

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:08.400
garrish family and uh but yes as they were born over in bristol lived there for quite some years

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:19.360
until I think there was there wasn't um my grandfather was a carpenter you know and

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:26.320
I think there really wasn't much work over there so they came back to rumney to find work over here

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:30.800
because they knew that they had some of the family were here they lived with them

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.600
initially moved in with the family

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
and then they moved away

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:44.560
yes and he used to used to make uh

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:57.920
oh um on the stairs you know the what you call them the spindles spindles on this thing he used

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.880
for houses that were being built really he did a lot of that

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:10.720
often you find carpenters are also coffin makers as well did he ever do anything like that

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:17.200
when what often i've heard that carpenters were also finished coffin makers as well

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:25.440
I don't think he did that as far as I know anyway no did your mother help on the farm

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:31.200
yes she did after they were married yes she did but before that while she was living in rumney

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:40.160
she was a local school teacher really yes in rumney school is that the school you went to

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:47.600
uh yes yes she was a school teacher I did yes she was a school teacher there but when

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:54.880
there but when when she got married they had to give it up like I mean not too long ago

00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:03.680
I know when I first started work if you got married you had to leave but then while I was

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:10.640
working they did away with that and we did you could stay on in the end but yes she um

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:20.080
yes as I said we lived in that cottage first of all only for about a year and then moved to rumney

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:29.120
and then upper newton upper newton farm is called yes so did you help with the milking

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.520
uh not then but later on

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:36.320
um

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.200
um

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:45.920
there were quite a few cows I suppose I can't remember exactly but we had sheep

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:54.160
because I had a little pet lamb oh I can remember that and they were there was a pig's

00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:05.520
cot there oh with two pigs in and also at that time we used to keep used to keep a bull oh oh

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:13.840
I never liked that bull that was in one of the sheds yeah but they used that for

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:25.520
or for extending the herd I suppose yeah but it wasn't safe to be around when the bull was out

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:31.600
because I can remember it was out one afternoon when my father's brother was there

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:39.280
he used to come up occasionally and he was I don't know what he was doing but somehow

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:47.280
they caught him got him down on the ground with his horn the bull in his horns got this uncle

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:53.600
down on the floor and I can remember my mother seeing it she she was so frightened she jumped

00:17:53.600 --> 00:18:00.880
out of the window on the back of the house and ran over to the people over the road in the farm

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:12.480
over there to tell them to come and help was he okay he was okay yes yes wasn't too too bad really

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:21.680
how many sheep did your father have how many sheep sheep it wasn't all that many not like they do

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.240
today

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:29.040
no I can't remember exactly how many did he ever do the shearing

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:40.640
yes they would do the shearing oh very clipper clipper thing like that you know that's all yeah

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.600
yeah

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:45.600
and

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:56.880
they had chickens yes they did yes yeah yes I can remember having we did have chickens

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:05.440
not many chickens and and even ducks occasionally oh goodness

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:13.360
yes and did you grow in your vegetable garden yes there was a very big vegetable garden

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:19.200
at the side of the house and during the war that was where we had our air raid shelter

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:30.000
it was built down in that vegetable garden really yeah who built it I think the council came and

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.520
built it and put it in but I can remember the air raid shelter being there and we used to go in

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:43.600
there a lot at night time once the air raid siren would go we'd keep a little out and we'd go in

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:50.880
spent I would spend at least one night in there stay there all night and come out in the daylight

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:58.160
in the morning so what when the siren went did your mother have a bag of stuff ready to bring

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.160
well we had this day

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:09.120
the air raid shelter was well it was comfortable no I think my mother they must have got some sort

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:15.040
of bedding there that when we went in there we had something comfortable we could lie down no

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:20.480
maybe a couple of blankets or something and we just stayed there until the all clear went

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:25.920
and very often it wouldn't be until the following morning sort of thing

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:35.040
so was it underground yes yes quite a bit down into the ground it was built yes

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:40.720
yes in that garden at the side it was the side at the side of one of the

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.040
the

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:55.600
uh co-sheds as well yes the big co-shed was alongside as well so do you ever

no no

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.060
no

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.120

uh you know because i think there was one the parade at one evening uh i suppose he was in

00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:02.400
uniform with his toting his gun and my father must have been down near the seawall because

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:12.480
i think he said that this person said halt who goes there you know oh goodness so you were

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:21.600
oh goodness so you were your farm was close to the seawall adjacent to it adjacent to it

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:28.320
yeah well it just wouldn't feel the way really gosh so did you ever experience flooding

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:36.640
no we didn't there used to be a high tide that would come over the street it would come up

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:46.480
uh on the other side from us they would the water would flood oh and come up has come up

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:53.120
you have a high tide you know come up as far as the wall sometimes but not all that much

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.040
but we used to go over

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:05.520
go over there a lot over the seawall and walk over on the lynches as they called them

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:14.480
walk down to what was the lynches lynches where the tide came in oh and uh

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:17.920
we used to

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:27.040
in bare feet we used to get down and walk on the where the tide came in because it was

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:35.440
mud really we were walking in muddy surrounds did your parents ever worry that you're right there

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:42.800
no oh we would we do it with them they would come with us because i can remember my father

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:49.520
lighting a fire i had a bonfire or something once and i think we tried to cook sausages or

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.280
something like that i can but um

00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:09.600
yes it is but any uh it was a lot of the the seawall was a an area for a lot of cattle

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:16.480
not only ours but other cattle belonging to other farms used to go over there and

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:22.560
were somewhere there where they could sort of graze and things like that they're grazing right

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:29.920
yeah that's right actually on the seawall itself yes depending how much land you had yes it was

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:38.480
according to how many sheeps and cattle that you put on there but there was rules you couldn't put

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:43.040
balls on there and rams you couldn't put balls and rams on there

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:50.800
did your father have to maintain the seawall or was that somebody else

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.000
i can't remember them having much to do to maintain it

00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:09.680
it was the way the wall went right up that way towards rumney came across us here and then

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:16.400
there was a bend in it was like a wall you'd go around and go on that way and there was then it

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:24.080
would go on down you could get down to peterson you see that way and so was the wharf near you

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:33.920
hmm rumney wharf that's what she's talking about yeah okay okay what'd she say i asked about the

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:43.280
wharf and you're called remny great wharf isn't it yes it was wasn't it so you you remember that

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:52.640
rumney great wharf was it that's what kathy says yeah yes so you remember that being bombed to you

00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:04.480
uh well yes we were bombed it wasn't the wharf was all right itself if we were bombed the bomb

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:14.720
landed on our on a barn you know by our house really yes yes we were bombed it was one night it

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:21.680
must in spring i think is when there was one of the worst bombs on cardiff and cardiff area

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:29.680
and we were and funny enough we weren't in the very cheddar that night we were in the house

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:43.760
we'd uh myself and my sister my mother and the dog were all sort of sitting and we had the table

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:50.160
in the middle there was a chest big chest that side there was a piano that side and then my

00:26:50.240 --> 00:27:02.320
father had put a a big thick uh oh what would you call it sleeper a plank cross

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:11.120
and we all we were underneath that underneath the table and the plank and uh with with my sister

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:18.640
my mother and the dog and my father happened to be out just not under the in the room but not

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:25.440
under the tank and all of a sudden i think he heard he heard this whistle and he was of a bomb

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:35.520
coming down and he sort of got down quickly and uh it's the base near i'm surprised that they

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:41.200
we did have something covering the door because you have to have blackouts you know and things

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:49.440
but uh did the bomb explode yes it landed on one of the uh

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.560
on the other side of the bar there was a barn between us

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:04.000
yeah there was the house there was the garden then there was the barn and then the other side of that

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:11.360
there were a few shed couchers and which animals were in and that's where it landed really on the

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:18.000
on the shed the barn and the shed and the shed was it really loud oh it's very loud

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:27.520
but the vibration of it i mean affected the house though because i can remember sitting in the house

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:35.760
and looking up and i could see where the ceilings moved away and i could see up through

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:46.720
could see up through there oh my goodness were you all frightened not really we did one you know

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:54.160
just wondered what had happened you know anyway when my dad got us out of the house he did wonder

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:58.880
whether or not the house might have collapsed so he got us out

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:08.080
dragged us over the local the little gates we had there because the blast had uh

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:15.120
jammed the gate shut and we couldn't open it gosh so my father had to lift us all over

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:22.240
and we all went across the yard down on the road down to the next farm

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:28.960
and we knocked them up and said oh we've just been bombed so they took us in there and i think

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:35.920
we did stay a couple of nights there gosh it's amazing Stephanie talking about this

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:42.320
incredible story you always take it in your stride

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:51.360
but was there much damage did you lose any animals we did one animal oh no

00:29:51.360 --> 00:30:01.280
calves they were a couple of calves i think were killed but there was one cow that had been

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:08.880
chained up in one of the sheds who with a blast she was blown blown out they found her wandering

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:15.760
up around the field the next morning with the chain around her neck still alive yes alive

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:26.640
how amazing how amazing gosh yes it was amazing

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:35.280
what did she say oh i mean the cow had post-traumatic stress

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:44.240
oh yes yeah so was it business as usual you went back home well yeah you had to really i mean

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:48.400
i seem to remember we stayed a couple of nights with the people next door

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:56.000
and then from there we moved over to where my mother's other sister and her husband family lived

00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:04.880
over in cattletown in well code curnew yeah i came through it coming here yes there was a house

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:09.840
and farm there that they were so i think we had a few nights there with them

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:17.440
um because i can remember getting a bus the next morning must have had some clothes with us and

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:23.760
i was at that time going to school in town i went to our ladies conference school so i

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:33.840
got the bus from code curnew into town and knocked the school door and said oh we've been bombed

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:41.280
out and they said oh yes we have as well they they'd had the fire fire there was burnt a lot of

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:49.280
other the school away yes there was a lot of bomb damage i think that particular time night

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:58.160
but then eventually we got back to rumney and we had um there was

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:02.640
uh the farm what was it called

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:16.240
peter may peter may they were billeted the farm where the prices lived long cross long cross farm

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:23.760
yeah we moved in with them yeah and it was through there was a what they called a billet

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:31.520
billeting yeah a billeting manager they had to find a place anybody bombed out they had to find

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:38.560
accommodation for them okay and they found us accommodation there yeah that's that's the farm

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:46.000
where these people lived and we were living there i think about a at least a year oh really yes so

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:53.200
what happened to why if your house was intact so why why did you leave your farm was there just

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:59.440
too much damage i think so well my father didn't want to stay there i think he felt that

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:06.640
because of the you know everything seemed to have got loose in the house he felt that the house could

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:15.680
collapse on us you know yeah that it wasn't but we were lucky eventually after staying a year about

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:23.680
long cross the other there was another farm before you got a long cross this was ceter bain farm

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:34.960
which was there next to that house there was a a searchlight battery and i think the man had lived

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:40.640
there i think he he'd managed to get out he'd had enough of it he didn't want to stay there any longer

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:46.480
he moved somewhere up the i can't remember where over the back of some islands

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:53.600
and put his house up for sale and my father bought the house there

00:33:54.240 --> 00:34:01.200
and land and we moved in there and we were there ever since until my father died gosh

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:07.200
so was that still in robinney well it was just a few yards up the road from where we were

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:14.080
when we bombed out oh gosh so yeah so it was rumney really yes what happened to your old

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:22.080
newton upper newton farm well we well we didn't do anything with it and it was used my father did

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:31.760
use it for a certain length of time um with cattle there and i think he obviously was able to milk

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:38.720
the cows i think from there but eventually it was moved most of it back up to teter main when

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:44.320
we were and was that still within sight of the seawall or was that yes yes it is

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:52.480
yes i mean we were there seawall was there we were there upper newton and it was just one or two

00:34:52.480 --> 00:35:01.280
fields up and then there was ceter bain there's a few houses around around there so as a child you

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:07.120
probably aren't aware of the pressures your parents were under finding a home and keeping

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:13.360
money coming in it must have been yes hard for your parents yes so i tried already had some

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:21.360
oh get the milk business going again and and did you continue going to school

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:30.640
yes i did so what was your sister's name what was your sister's name janice janice yes

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:35.200
she i think she died some years ago um

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.320
yes uh

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:51.840
i'm trying to think though if i'd started school high school while i was in we were in newton

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.280
upper newton farm

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.800
and then of course i continued high school from

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:06.880
teter main but i had to walk up the road walk to the local the nearest bus stop

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:15.440
yeah and get the bus into town to get to school eventually yeah this is intercardiff

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.480
yes intercardiff that was so was there lots of damage then lots of bomb damage there was at the

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:28.800
school yes it it had uh what called an incendiary bomb as it caught fire no

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:37.120
did any of your neighbours did anyone any friends or neighbours get bombed did anyone lose their

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:46.240
um not immediately close no i got an idea one or two places up in rumney may have got

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:53.600
bombed i can't remember too much about that i know that there were one or two farms down

00:36:54.400 --> 00:37:00.480
towards peterston some brides that were

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:13.840
they'd have didn't lose too much they'd like them they got the the roof of the buildings got blown

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:21.040
off something like that and there was one house that we i can remember visited that was bombed

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:28.720
and they built a new house there and that must have been to do with the tridegar estate

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:36.880
on that land and they would replace it by building a new house but we didn't

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:47.680
no we didn't have that i mean we actually i was glad when we bought this other farm

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:53.360
she said me because we moved up a bit further and it was getting nearer to the to the village

00:37:53.360 --> 00:38:00.400
really that i used to find the other place was a long way down that we had to what you'd walk up

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:11.920
and our cycle everywhere mostly into rumney um but even i think from food teacher me we used to cycle

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:16.400
into rumney and leave my sister and i used to cycle because we went the same school

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:25.040
and we used to park our bikes at the bottom of rubbley village and then get the best into town

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:32.000
no did you did you have to wear a uniform to school then yes did we did our school uniforms

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:40.640
i went to the conference school our ladies conference school were you catholics no no

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:47.040
you couldn't no we weren't really honey we i don't know we didn't pass high enough to go

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:54.480
to the proper high school so we went there my parents paid for us to be educated there

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:02.480
do you know what i've heard people talk about stories of um

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:10.240
um you know when people grazing their cows on the foreshore beyond the sea wall

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:18.000
i've even heard somebody talk about hay making of you know the little islands off the shore

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.200
do you know anything about that

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:25.120
hay making i didn't do any hay making over there

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:34.960
and but your father used to do it up here he he did some hay making here where these houses are

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:42.320
yes but he was really helping my uncle my uncle that was living down here and he was a farmer

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:49.920
uh all all the three brothers were all farmers i think except one was a school teacher and he

00:39:49.920 --> 00:40:00.880
was the only one but um there were i can remember the the lorries of

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:13.360
it must have been lorries would go streaming down the road past the farm down to the

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:21.920
sea wall they usually they were army lorries yeah and they were getting rid of the unexploded bombs

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:32.080
that were around and we used to we used to see these lorries going oh speeding really ever so

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:37.760
fast down the road they got to get down to the sea wall before the bomb exploded and what did

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:43.680
they do the bomb when they got to the sea wall well i think they must have dumped it on they

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:54.080
took it and dumped it on the uh where where the as we called them lynches were which was where the

00:40:54.080 --> 00:41:01.600
sea sea came up so far and then you got the there was a lot of grass on the sea wall yeah because

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:07.440
a lot of animals were over there but they were dumped down in the mud you somewhere you know

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:11.520
i wonder they ever exploded when they were i don't know whether i can't remember

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:17.840
know whether they exploded or not how do you spell lynches lynches yeah how would you spell that

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:34.880
um l i n c h e s l y l y c h e s lynches well that's what we used to call them anyway

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:45.280
sorry sorry gaffi do you know rose yes she'll know about that yes so she she's gathering all

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:52.720

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:58.880

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:07.120
levels or moors some people call it more yeah the moors rumney moors would you say moors or levels

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:14.080
well i i moors i suppose initially years ago but they seem to call be calling the place

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:18.560
the levels don't they know did you ever swim in the sea

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:26.640
i try i know i don't think we did really but it was because it was an awful lot of mud there

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:30.960
that it was just mud that you were walking and not swimming and

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:37.520
fishing down there and put your ranks and stuff was that yes there was one local man

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:46.320
who used to come down here regularly even when we were in the teacher main they used to see him

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:52.240
cycling down the road going over to the wharf and i don't know where he went exactly but

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:59.520
he used to get a lot of fish and he used to get a lot of fish and he used to get a lot of fish

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:09.520
used to catch yes he used to put some i think he used to put something out like we could see these

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:19.440
pieces of wood standing up in the in the water over there i think it must have been some sort

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:25.840
of trap that he put to catch fish was it like a butcher you know like the conical

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:33.440
um no i could they were just ordinary oh straight friends can't remember too much about them

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:43.520
but i on the way home he was often call in if he got fish and caught a lot yeah um he would call

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:52.000
in and we would my mother would buy some fish off him it's very good there a salmon or it was

00:43:52.880 --> 00:44:00.160
flatfish as we called it okay what was that place isn't it it was mostly place i think yeah

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:09.520
fresh fish yes certainly fresh did anyone else ever fish off the shore there i don't know

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:17.440
of anyone else that did but there was just this oh did you copy did you say you did yeah

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:26.560
oh what you say they can't you sister's boyfriend sister's boyfriend did you do

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:32.000
your sister's boyfriend i used to go my sister's ex-boyfriend used to go fishing over there

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:38.000
kathy used to go with her sister's ex-boyfriend they used to go fishing together oh that's it

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:48.160
okay all right what about the the reams did your dad have to maintain the reams yes they did have

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:59.520
to maintain the reams yeah because we used to have one a guy why we were before we moved from

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:08.480
where we were born doubt we used to have employee men to do a lot of the work in around the farm

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:19.520
and it was mostly digging out the reams to keep them clear really yeah they were two different

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:26.560
and they used to come they used to live on the farm but they'd live in the barn you know they'd

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:33.760
we'd stick up put up a bed for them in the barn and they would sleep there and

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:43.680
yes we'd had two i can remember now and they were very strong men and one was particularly strong

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:55.760
he used to call him a digger i think a digger and he came came from somewhere like oh jersey

00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:01.520
or channel islands i think i seem to remember them saying yeah but

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:13.760
yes he certainly kept the the reams very clear and used to oh dig them all up all the muds when

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:20.640
push them up on the side of the on the bank of the side of the ream yes they used to do that every

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:27.040
so often i mean at least once a year i would think it was did they use special tools do you know

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:30.480
oh i don't think so just

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:37.520
a spade or something or it a fork and spade

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:45.280
what about eels eel traps and things like that in the reams did you know anything about that

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:49.120
i didn't know of any there now on the

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.720
um

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:59.840
the oh the farm the one that caught on fire recently

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:12.160
what was the price is farm called long cross i don't know why i can't remember it long cross

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:20.320
now near the just before you get to long cross there was like a little bridge almost over the

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:27.120
ream and i can remember going over there and standing looking down into the ream and seeing

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:35.520
these eels they did have eels there but not um i don't think i don't know they got there

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:45.440
but not in generally amongst them the reams but um yes there were certainly quite a few eels there

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:52.480
and then they we then go from there up and because the long cross farm really was on the main road out

00:47:54.080 --> 00:48:01.440
and um did you remember the names of your reams on your land do you remember the names of them

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:07.120
of your reams on your land do you remember the names of them the names of the reams on your

00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:11.280
no i don't remember and you know i'm afraid

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:24.480
oh but during the war i can remember the american soldiers yeah geese yeah walking down

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:31.760
and we we go up to go up to the village or go as far as long cross and stand there and

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:38.800
and you'd look up the road and you'd see all this these load of these um american gis all

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:47.040
marching down the road they'd all been billeted up in rumney somewhere yeah and uh

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:54.400
uh they would go they marched down every morning because there were some some of works down the

00:48:54.400 --> 00:49:01.520
other end and they were all working there at these i don't know what they did exactly but

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:08.480
but i as a child i can remember them marching around did they ever talk to you or give you

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:15.360
sweets or anything like that oh not wait i think they did up in rumney there were more children

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:24.560
up there so your dad was too old for the second world war yes but he wasn't he wasn't um not

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:33.680
really um he wasn't called up because of being a farmer of course he was in uh what do they call it

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:43.280
a something reserved occupation reserved occupation yes as a farmer no none of our family were in the

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:48.880
war because they his brothers they they were all the family were all farmers you see

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:55.760
did you ever play in the reams or jump over the rings oh no

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:08.720
yes across to the seawall yeah but they were it was only having a plank of wood

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:14.000
yeah and as kids we used to fall in what she said i can't hear what you say

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:24.640
cathie is saying that her grandfather used to put planks across the reams oh yes to get over to the

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:32.560
wall on the seawall yeah yes he did had big planks yeah across it was easy to cross over the rings

00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:36.400
but then cathie used to fall in and get covered in duckweed

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:40.080
oh

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:46.160
so what sort of games did you play as a child

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:52.480
did you ever play i can't really remember playing games too much no

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:56.400
oh

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:02.640
yes i said we did really what did you have to do

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:10.400
i can't remember what we didn't go actually milking the cows then

00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:17.760
used to feed the chickens

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:23.440
we was oh some of the chickens oh i can remember one or two of them

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:30.880
especially the cockerels they were really flighty ones they'd fly they'd fly right up and pack you

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:35.920
on your legs but my father would

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:38.080
but my father would

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:48.240
he'd if he wanted to we'd he'd kill a chicken for christmas you know

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:55.920
christmas time the chickens were really valuable and he'd kill one and

00:51:55.920 --> 00:52:00.000
feather it and i can remember feathering it yes did you and then

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:07.920
yes they would kill them and the ducks and we were

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:17.520
it was very useful really because during the war food was rationed yeah and we had our own

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:25.600
as i said dad would kill christmas time he'd kill a chicken or kill a duck and

00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:32.960
i think he even they were allowed to kill one pig a year for food

00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:40.000
was there a village pig killer who used to come oh there was somebody who came around

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:48.240
yes they were and

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:54.560
so nothing was wasted no not really no no no we certainly did very well for food you know although

00:52:54.560 --> 00:53:01.360
it was rationed during the war did your mother do lots of bottling of fruit and vegetables

00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:05.520
they did a certain amount yes

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:12.720
yes because we did have those bottles that you could get the jars killed their jars yes that's

00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:21.280
right that you could preserve the fruit or whatever in the well for food you know although it was

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:28.240
rationed during the war did your mother do lots of bottling of fruit and vegetables they did a

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:31.120
kill no jobs yes that's right that you could

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.440
preserve the fruit or whatever in

00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:48.000
so do you do you see yourself as a welsh woman or a woman of the levels or the malls

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:53.520
i don't have no thought about either really

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:59.760
you just give me a sense of how much this area has changed stephanie because

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:08.880
i mean it must have been really moral once was it well there is um oh it's built upon now you see

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:15.680
isn't it i mean as i said this this place here where all these houses are built was

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:16.480
uh

00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:27.360
it it was used to cut yeah they cut the grass make hay from it because it was my uncle that

00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:33.680
used to do it he used to look after cutting the hay this field here and the one next to it

00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:41.120
and sometimes my father would come up and help him you know and i can remember dancing around on

00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:49.520
around on almost the road out here and it was hay we was uh that we were dancing on sort of

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:59.200
thing you know really oh yes but and and because the road down below it's really a main road down

00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:08.400
there now but it used to be a very narrow country road not much traffic no not much traffic um even

00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:15.440
when we moved in here and there were no buses to get for them to get to school they used to send a

00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:24.880
lorry or a van up here in which leslie and kathy would get in and they take them to school and

00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:34.880
and bring them back in the afternoon but um so do you know the levels on the other side of the usk

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:37.200
do you know that area very much no

00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:40.720
no i don't really

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:45.920
what did she say they're better on this side no

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:53.360
because he's so built up over here we're right at the limit aren't we

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:57.120
right yeah

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:06.960
it's more built up here yes yes it's always been uh that main road has always been there

00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:19.120
but they have since since my childhood days they were they made it wider and cost a lot more houses

00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:28.000
along there now when i was in school over in remny they were oh very few houses one odd

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:36.160
house here and there along the main road you know and then all of a sudden they started

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:43.280
widening the road and building more houses and that's how remny was extended

00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:50.720
it you've got amazing views from here though haven't you yes yes if only i could appreciate

00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:57.120
them now i did when we first moved in but i can't now it's no good i can't see it but um

00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:05.280
yes and they were one i can remember one house on the main road it was

00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:12.000
where one of the school teachers lived in there oh have you got any photographs of your childhood

00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:22.400
oh yeah i don't think so have i yeah of the newton here go have a look

00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:31.360
what's she saying kathy's going to have a look to see if she can find any photographs well there

00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:34.640
were a lot of photographs around but i don't know what's happened to them

00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:41.520
um so if there's anything you'd like to add stephanie i haven't asked you about

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:50.640
as a teenager on the levels and remny what did you do oh i never really appreciated

00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:58.160
time on the farm as a teenager i used to i used to always wanted to why can't we move

00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:05.120
nearer up into the village a bit more and i i'd have to be able to get to my friends these there

00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:12.160
and then because i used to visit some of the lot up there but but then to get home

00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:21.120
i had to get my bike and cycle home oh nighttime it was dark cycling

00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:25.680
um and it was all downhill was it yes it was really

00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:33.280
yeah because one or at least one of the bridges that was there we used to go over

00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:40.960
as big that's been knocked down it's not there now really so bridges to go over the rings you mean

00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:48.000
a bridge no railway line oh really yeah it was the railway line they went over i mean the railway

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.600
line is still there but they used to be

00:58:54.800 --> 00:59:01.440
i think i can vaguely remember they in marshfield i think they had a

00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:12.000
the trains would stop in marshfield at one time years ago yes there was a station there

00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:17.600
gosh did you ever use it i don't remember using it no no

00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:28.800
oh so was your husband a farmer no no he wasn't he wasn't he lived up in rumney

00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:36.320
yeah uh david he was uh he was an architect was he really he did all these paintings

00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:43.600
really yes that one there the opposite dog i think that one yeah

00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:50.160
so maybe one of the boats here yes he did that yeah there's the one behind you

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:58.240
that he did that's my granddaughter well i know there's one of my granddaughter further over

00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:01.760
that's on uh what you call it

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:09.840
it's very good the the young one yes that's my granddaughter when she's about

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:18.080
four or five years old isn't she gorgeous isn't she gorgeous yeah yeah and then further over is

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:22.080
the one taken when she graduated from university

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:24.080
oh

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.840
and then there's a couple of other

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:33.920
paintings in the other room as well he did a lot of paintings

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:43.360
and there's a lot in of the grandchildren he did in the in the in the near the front door and

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:53.680
and so you moved here in 1960 did you say 1960 so were these new then newly built yes they were

01:00:53.680 --> 01:01:02.480
newly built wimpy's was the name of the builders i don't know whether they're around now so where

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:09.200
had you moved from to come here oh we after when we were first married we lived down on the farm

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:16.160
with my parents for about a year yeah but i i wanted to get out i wanted to be near a town

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:24.960
so we discovered that where i was working in a bank in lord's bank and there was some guy there

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:31.760
was living in a flat in town and he was about to move out told me about it so i said oh we'll see

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:38.800
see if we can have it you know yeah we did so we had a flat there not far from

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:47.920
albany road i think it was and we lived there for seven years actually actually my other daughter

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:55.280
was born while we were there and then it was when i was expecting cathy that we moved out here

01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:00.560
and what was it like moving in here knowing that your dad had made hay here and stuff

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:05.520
oh yes i i don't know i can't

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.120
can't believe that it happened all those years ago

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.600
it's amazing and with some occasionally we talk about

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:28.080
because when the original narrow road down here it went up stopped and then it went down round

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:39.360
bit further down and there was a a water pipe in the road and this water was continually running

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:44.720
out of this pipe and i think there must have come from over

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:53.600
i said that the water came from rumney or lan rumney came through

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:59.440
it must have been something somewhere

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:09.360
because rem well i suppose remney's got a few old places and amongst them you know yeah did you ever

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:17.840
go to church as a child yes or chapel we went to the baptist chapel in rumney yeah yes every sunday

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:24.720
yes we did would you walk up on the farm we'd have to walk and we'd go my sister and i would

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:30.240
go to sunday school we'd use our bikes then even in the wet weather i can remember

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:36.320
riding up on my bikes leaving them out the side of the church and go to sunday school

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.440
and then get back home and

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:47.600
it was amazing i didn't like it from that point of view i hated having to cycle all the way up

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:52.080
in all the weather the wet weather and

01:03:55.520 --> 01:04:02.640
but yes it was a rumney baptist that was and there were one or two shops

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:10.000
rumney it was called rumney village and it was just a village then in those days

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:17.200
so did it have a shop and the baker and the pub yes they did yes yes

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:22.240
but um it must have been so rural

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:28.880
yes i mean the this this um

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:38.160
name on the bus telling you where it's going was rumney village it wasn't just rumney it was rumney

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:45.920
village and it used to come out from town and it would only go into the middle of the village

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:53.120
they even cut down the length of their journey you know during the war to save uh petrol i suppose

01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:01.040
so as a child did you have electricity in your farmhouse we didn't in the first farm no

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:10.000
and we didn't in the second farm uh no it was oil lamps oh i hated it from that point of view

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:17.840
but eventually my my father did manage to get they brought the electricity

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:28.080
by poles so uh so it ended up in the farm next to us and my father used to say well why don't

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:34.080
they bring it over here as well uh but we did get it over but my father had to pay it

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:40.880
that's for it to be brought over that we had electricity in the farm then because they were

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:50.800
then able to use um electricity for milking the cows you know yeah which happened to know it was

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:57.520
always hand so when would that have been stephanie would that be in the 40s um or the 50s

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.880
when what when did the electricity come to the farm

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:10.160
it must have been in the 50s let me see if we were the early 40s that we were bombed out

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:17.760
and when 39 45 the war ended in the um

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:25.760
oh maybe maybe in the late 40s then it probably came

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:35.760
and it was so it made such a difference to the work to have the electricity there

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:42.640
so what had your mother been cooking on was it wood oh she had an oven uh stove

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:49.280
uh stove what do they call it a grange um paraffin oh god so big stove

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:57.120
smelly funded by paraffin and there was an oven on top that used to put stuff in to cook

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:06.080
but there was um oh what was there we did have a

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.960
oh

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:18.400
kitchen no it was a kitchen in the house and then there was an outside room outside in which oh

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:27.280
but eventually we do we used to my father got a stove from somewhere

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:37.200
and i think we used to have to get it going to use some firewood you know when to get it working

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.280
about your water where did your water come from oh

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.200
well if we certainly had water on all right anyway i don't know where it came from

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:57.440
it certainly certainly had a water supply there

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:10.960
but even when we moved into that farm there were no electricity there were there was quite a

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:18.640
let me see one two three there were four very big bedrooms but then we had one of them

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:25.840
converted into a bathroom gosh and indoor toilet there was no indoor toilets you know

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:33.440
things like that there's at the end of the garden yes that was the privy down the garden end of the

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:40.240
garden and that would have been like a compost toilet would it yes that was down you went outside

01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:48.640
right and down a lane that was down behind a big hedge really

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:57.360
and you had to use it might you had to use well my father dealt with it had to use some

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:07.200
keep its supplies with oh what was that stuff that they used that sawdust so no no it was

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:12.000
like a liquid it was like oh i can't think no

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:22.560
did you have a chamber pot under the bed yes we did we certainly did i think it was in all the

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:32.160
bedroom until eventually my father got the you got the local builder came in to alter it and

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:39.200
put a toilet in and then we did have a more of a toilet out in the garden then

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:50.080
but yes did you ever experience poachers on your farm people coming to grab a chicken or

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:57.360
oh not really no i don't remember that the only people that we used to have around but

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.240
with the gypsies yeah but sometimes

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:11.840
they were in a way they were genuine tipsies because i can remember one gypsy caravan coming

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:18.320
down the road was parked just at the top of the road before you turned in to our place

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:26.720
and he asked asked my father permission could he stay there for a month or something and which he

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:34.800
did and they were all right but they were quite well behaved gypsies actually did they work on the

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:43.200
farm and no they didn't know they might remember i mean we did have workers on the farm but i i

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:50.160
tell oh my father got hold of them there were two one that used to weigh he must have been

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:59.920
i've been in the army at one time because he used to weigh where uh ex army great coach you know

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:05.840
and he was the one that the ones that we had to work on the farm there were just two all together

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:20.080
um we give them accommodation in uh in our shed and barn you know we'd fix up some place where

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:27.840
it was really comfortable the day would sleep there you know so were the gypsies regular visitors

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:36.960
or would you see them in the well they were they were for the um the ones that works

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.720
i can't remember now how long days were they may perhaps stayed about a year and then

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:47.840
another one would come and stay a year

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:56.320
and then we did have there was somebody my father knew from that was in town he was a townie

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:06.720
he came out to help out on the farm i think my father must have come across him through the milk

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:13.520
round that he had perhaps he supplies the family with milk and and he because he used to come out

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:20.960
and used to stay as well god we've got some photographs here do you manage to find

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:31.920

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:38.800
church did they get married at oh there's a rumney rumney rumney church but in what was what

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:44.160

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:53.840
