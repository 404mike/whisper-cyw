This is Vicki MacDonald and I'm at Holy Trinity Church, Llandudno, during the longest yarn.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And I'm speaking to Pat Ashworth, who lives currently in Duganwy, but was living in Llandudno during the war.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Hello, Pat.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Hello, Vicki.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So tell me your memories.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Well, my memories during the war, one vivid memory was being quite terrified when the Germans were bombing Liverpool

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and after they dropped their bombs, they flew over Llandudno.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And during that time, they dropped a bomb on Nantegamma Mountain and then flew over Conway and out to sea.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And I remember we had double summertime then, so it was light till midnight.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And I can remember standing at the end of my bed, holding the bed frame and shaking because we could see all the lights on Liverpool from the bombs that were dropped by the Germans.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So Liverpool was a light and you could see the brightness from it.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Yes, yes. And then hearing the planes flying over was quite terrifying because I didn't know what they were going to do next.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And that's my biggest memory of the war really.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And of being really scared that you would be the next.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Especially Lantegamma was relatively close. I didn't know there was a bomb that dropped on Lantegamma.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Was anyone killed?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
No, no, no. I don't know if the crate is still there.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I wonder whether it is. So you were quite young.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I think I was about nine or eight. I was at junior school.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Did you have a gas mask to go to school? Was that considered important in Llandudno?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
We had gas masks. All school children had gas masks.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And of course the Ministry of Finance were here, weren't they, in Llandudno?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Yes.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So Llandudno must have been full of strangers. Did it feel as though your town had been taken over?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.000
No, not particularly. My mother worked in the Income Tax Office at what was the hotel, the Marine Hotel.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Yes, all the hotels were taken over, weren't they?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Yes.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I know the Imperial was taken over.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And it was called the Boulevard recently, but I can't remember the name during the war, but the BBC were there.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And they broadcast all the ITMA programmes and the news.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
There was a lot of help here in Llandudno for everybody.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So the Germans dropped the bomb on Nantegama presumably by accident, but perhaps if they'd known what was going on in Llandudno, they might have aimed them a bit more accurately.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Yes, but they dropped them to make their aircraft lighter to fly back to Germany.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So I know you were rationed. Did it feel uncomfortable? Did you feel hungry?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
No, no, we didn't. We were rations.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And one thing I remember, I'd lost my sweet coupons and I couldn't find them anywhere.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And then that was the summertime. And I was in the brownies then. And then when I went, started with the brownies again in September, there was my sweet coupon in my brownie pocket.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And so you didn't have sweets that time? Because I remember after the war we had sweet coupons.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Yes.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
But it wasn't a great hardship. There was always enough, wasn't there?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
No, and my mother did all the cooking and we weren't short of food.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So was your father away in the services perhaps?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:43.000
No, my father, he was in the Air Force in Carnarvon and he had an accident. So he was invalid out of the Air Force. So he didn't, he wasn't in good health.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
So he was home during the war?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Yes, yes.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Oh, thank you very much. Have you got any other things that you think you might have remembered?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Oh, I remember walking home from school, which was Craigadon School.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And there would be a man walking around and he'd have a photograph in his hand and come up to you and say, show you the photograph and say, have you seen this man?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And that was terrifying because what was he looking for, you know, a spy? I don't know.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Did you ever find out what he was looking for?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000
No, no, no, but he's not quite a fuel of a school of children because there were no buses then.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:44.000
We all walked home from school, walked to school and walked back at lunchtime home because no school meals.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
The weather was bad. My mother would bring sandwiches for us.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And you never found the strange man they were looking for?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
No.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Oh goodness. I wonder who he was.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I wonder. Never know.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Never know. No. Oh, thank you very much. I really enjoyed your memories. Thank you so much. I'm going to put it off now.
