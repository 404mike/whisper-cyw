00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.500
Come, my dear, you will hear my song,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.500
As it never, never will be.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.500
Come, my dear, you will hear my song,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.000
When the red o'er the tide breaks,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.500
When the fire burns, when the fire burns,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:46.500
Come, O David, come and watch,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:56.500
Come, O David, come and watch.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.000
By the hand of ancient Bethel,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.500
He drew some in heaven there.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.000
By the hand of the morning and night,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Come, O God, and bless them there.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Come, O David, come and watch,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Where the world thy heart I greet.
