00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
Firstly, let us say thank you to Heritage Lottery in Wales for enabling us to bring

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.480
you these podcasts.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:17.360
My name is Jamie Baker and I'm part of Horn Development Association, HDA in Cardiff.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:25.000
And this site, Black Diverse and Welsh, is intended to bring together lots of initiatives

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.040
that we've been involved in in terms of Black and Diverse people in Wales.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.600
But most immediately, a series of episodes, a series of contributions, which are about

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.320
Cardiff.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.280
And if you sit outside the Norwegian church on the bay in Cardiff and in better times

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.920
have a cup of coffee, hopefully this series of podcasts over the next few months will

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:58.280
give you an idea what that place you're looking at used to be, what's happened there and

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:06.040
what it represents to the people who live or lived in the streets you, to a large extent,

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.000
can't see anymore.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.440
This is episode six of the series of podcasts and it's with Richard Ford.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.320
We're recording, so wherever you want to start mate.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.800
OK, right.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.240
My name is Richard Ford.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.600
I'm 61 years of age at this moment in time.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:37.240
I'm one of nine children, mixed heritage, Caribbean, from Barbados, my grandfather.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:47.240
My grandfather on my mother's side was from Yemen and the rest of us are mainly Welsh.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:56.000
I lived in West Coast, which was kind of in between the docks and Tiger Bay.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.920
And I grew up, as I say, one of nine children.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.760
My first memory I come up with pop bottles.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.120
We used to have glass pop bottles and people would ask you to go to the shop or you'd ask

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.400
them if they want anything in the shop because you would go in.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.200
And for going in return instead of giving you money, they'd give you bottles to take

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.200
back because you got money off them.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:27.120
So that was helpful to yourself and obviously to the state of the world right now because

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.280
now we're using too much plastic.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.280
Timber floats, right?

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.680
There was a place called the timber floats.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.400
They used to have logs in that and in water basically and we used to go fishing over there

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.400
with my brothers.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.360
Basically, my brother used to take me out of the house because I was like four or five

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.000
and I'd sit on the riverbank.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.800
And on two occasions I went fishing with him.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.800
I fell in.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.800
So that was another memory that stuck in my mind.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.600
In West Coast we had this place called the Patch outside everyone's house.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.520
It's kind of built in a circle.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.360
It's still there now, right at this moment, but they have built gardens on it, which is

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.040
not the same as it was obviously back in the day.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:18.120
We used to be able to, in winter, throw ice, throw water on the Patch to make ice so we'd

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.120
have slides.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.760
That was a great fun and didn't cost anything and didn't hurt anybody, hurt yourselves.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:34.440
Teenagers, teenage life, we used to go to Top Rank, which was in town, and we used to

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.640
go to Under 18's Discos.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.640
So that was on a Tuesday evening and Saturday morning.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:49.720
And we would always, as an area, meet up outside after it finished, the dances had finished,

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:57.480
and we'd all walk home or we'd meet outside and in a place called Caroline Street so everyone

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.280
could kind of get back home, down to the bay, safely.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.280
Because a lot of times...

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.280
Chippies and kebabs.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.280
Sorry?

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.280
Chippies and kebabs.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.920
Yeah.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.920
Caroline Street.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.920
Yeah.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.280
So, you know, it's kind of a way of getting home safely and making sure everybody got

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.400
home safely because a lot of times you get stopped by the police in harassed.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.800
It's interesting, one thing about, I'll just interrupt Rich and say, the difference between

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:35.440
being in the docks and the bay, Tiger Bay, and going under that bridge into town.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.120
Unbelievable.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.120
Foreign territory.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.920
And I worked there for 20 years afterwards.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:51.160
So it's still kind of strange because as you say, foreign territory, even though I worked

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.160
there.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:59.800
The funeral, this is something that we did, the Leibar was known as to do, carried our

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:06.120
owned from the houses up to the church or the mosque.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:13.440
And after the service, we would always bury the person as a mark of respect.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.960
When they've done...

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.760
For people who don't understand, Richard, when you say bury them, give them an idea

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.480
of what was involved for all the men.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.280
We would all get a shovel.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.640
As many shovels as you could get.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.680
And the grave would be open and we would fill the grave in.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.680
And I think that stems back, way, way back.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.160
Yeah, I mean it's a Muslim tradition, but the bay...

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.160
No, no.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:52.480
Well, in other countries, it's a Muslim tradition, but in the bay, there was no difference on

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.480
faiths, was there?

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.480
You took the best of each.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.480
No, not at all.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.480
Not at all.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.600
Because it stemmed from poverty.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.640
So save money, everyone helped.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:11.680
And it's a tradition that's passed on from one generation to another.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:18.040
So it keeps the community strong as well, unfortunately.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.360
It's an act that we all have to go through.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.200
It's nice to think that someone's going to give your family the same respect that you

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.680
gave to them.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.680
We went to Sunday school, which was called Band of Hope.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.040
That was in Hannah Street.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:43.160
And that was a Tuesday evening and Sunday morning.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.360
And then obviously later on, we go to St. Mary's Church.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.360
Yeah, my wife's telling me where they gave you sweets to go to Hannah Street.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:07:01.360
At St. Mary's Church, they had a local football team, which we used to go around playing.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.360
Kings from the parishes.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:10.360
And also going up the valleys now, which was another experience.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.360
Just to play football and getting chased off the pitch because of the colour of your skin,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.360
basically.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.360
You're talking like late 60s, early 70s.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.360
I mean, it was still a problem, racism.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:29.360
But it wasn't a problem in the Bay, in Tiger Bay or the Docks?

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.360
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.360
Everybody was welcome.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.360
I always said the only way you could find trouble in the Bay and the Docks was if you

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.360
came looking for it.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.360
Otherwise, you were welcome with open arms.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.360
I've always taught my kids as well.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.360
You can't buy respect.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.360
You have to earn it.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.360
Yeah, I know I was taught.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.360
You don't look for trouble.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.360
No.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.360
But you're ready if trouble comes.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.360
Yeah.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.360
And those who know you are expected to have your back.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.360
Yes, yes, definitely.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.360
And we both know that from older times.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.360
From growing up.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.360
In top rank and other places.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.360
Yeah, definitely.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.360
It's all right.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:21.360
You have someone always at your back because you're proud of growing up and finding yourself.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:29.360
And as a child, I say a child, like eight or nine, ten, that kind of age, taught by

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.360
my parents to don't come in crying.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:39.360
If you got yourself in a fight and it's someone of your own age and size and things, you go

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.360
back out there.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.360
If it was somebody bigger and older than me, I have brothers.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.360
Then, you know, my mother turned my brothers in because I'm being bullied.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:54.360
But otherwise, I have to stick up for myself, which made me a stronger character.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.360
And it also taught me not to be a bully as well.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.360
I respect people.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:05.360
And I was speaking to Karen Alley earlier on.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.360
OK.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:12.360
And she was saying about how people showed respect to older people by calling them auntie

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.360
and uncle and stuff like that.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.360
That's very true.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.360
Yes.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.360
Yeah.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.360
That's something I also pass on to my children.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:28.360
And the youngest one turned around to me and he said to me, after I introduced him to my

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.360
closest friend, Rosie Parrish.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.360
And I said to him, this is Auntie Rosie.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.360
And he said to me, right dad.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.360
He said, no, is this respect or blood?

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:50.360
That was his way of differentiating because he's got a lot of aunties and uncles.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.360
So, you know, it enabled him to find out who's who.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.360
Yeah, we go for big families.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.360
Yeah.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.360
So one of nine.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.360
My father was one of 13.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:10.360
I worked as a youth worker for a thing called Community Roots.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:17.360
And I was to assist people who were unemployed to try and help them get back into work.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.360
And it was run at Chalky White's Youth Center.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.360
So I created our own football team.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.360
It was the first one we had down there.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:33.360
And we got to be successful and won the Wednesday League.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.360
There was about 15 sides.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.360
And we won the cup.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.360
And we've done that for about four or five years.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.360
You mentioned Rosie Parrish.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.360
Yes.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.360
And it made me think of Frankie Parrish.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.360
Frankie, yeah.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.360
And the Kayaks.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.360
Right.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.360
I was in only a couple of months ago.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.360
I was in Bridge End.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.360
And somebody said to me, came up to me and said, do you know the Kayaks?

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.360
Mr. J said, hardest team we ever played rugby against.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.360
He said, hardest team we ever played.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.360
He said, I can't understand.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.360
All those boys weren't playing for Cardiff.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.360
I said, nor could we.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.360
Because we were discriminated against.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.360
And my cousin had the worst one of all.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.360
He represented his country.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.360
Stephen, Stephen Ford.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:37.360
But because he went for a trial at Bradford.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.360
Rugby League.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.360
And came back.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.360
Sorry, the other code, rugby league.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.360
He came back from that and he got suspended.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.360
I think it was like six months he couldn't play.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.360
And he also got a fine.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:55.360
Which was a lot when you were an amateur because he was at those times.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:02.360
And they couldn't work out why so many black or mixed race kids ended up at rugby league.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.360
Yes, because that's what they used to do.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.360
Yeah, and it was the only way they made a wage.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.360
That's right.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.360
And they were noted for their skills.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.360
And many of them had lots of skill.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:24.360
So naturally, I mean if someone's going to say to you, play for nothing or play for whatever, X amount a week.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.360
Obviously you're going to take the money because that's what you're there for.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:32.360
Especially when they show you respect.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.360
And the fans cheer you.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.360
Yes.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.360
You know.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.360
We've all been in those games where you take so much abuse from the sidelines.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.360
That you just start to ignore it.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.360
And show your own skills and rise above it.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:56.360
We had the second biggest carnival in Britain before it got cut.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.360
Before they cut the budget.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.360
That was kind of pay taking over and deciding that.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:06.360
Because we had so many people going down to the park.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.360
By the community center.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.360
It was like five, six thousand.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.360
In that time there was a lot of people.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.360
They decided in their wisdom that they would cut our budgets.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.360
We couldn't run it anymore.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:26.360
And they put the thing up by the county hall on the August.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.360
It was a fair with live stages.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.360
Not stages.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.360
A live band, sorry.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.360
Went to the dance from the community center.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.360
From a young man till present day.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.360
Until COVID has cut it.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:43.360
Community center is a local center basically.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.360
As I said, state's community center.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.360
Our ages, our walks of life.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.360
Going there to meet up.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.360
Funerals, weddings.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.360
Mostly funerals.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.360
Occasional weddings.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.360
But they would have dances as well on Saturday night.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:00.360
And we'd have coaches coming down from London, Birmingham, Bristol.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.360
Everywhere.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.360
All over Britain.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.360
And they'd play dominoes together and have a dance later on.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.360
I used to work in the Casablanca.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.360
Ah, that's a place I remember.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.360
Go on.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.360
Very special.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.360
Very special.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.360
Definitely.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:19.360
And we used to have sound systems coming from all over Britain.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.360
But we also used to do live bands.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:29.360
And I was a doorman at the time.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.360
And the DJ had actually had an argument with the boss.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.360
And quit.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.360
So they said to me, you've got to step in.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.360
Never DJ'd in my life.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.360
Right.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.360
Okay.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.360
So I played, bought us some music.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.360
So they said to me, right.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.360
Okay.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.360
Now your job is DJing.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.360
And you've now got to book the bands.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.360
Okay.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.360
So I did that.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.360
And I mixed the mixing desk.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.360
All untrained.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.360
Never been trained in any of it.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.360
I just put my ear to it and thought, well, I could do it.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.360
So I will go.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:01.360
And this is my creme de creme cockup.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:07.360
I booked this band on the Friday gig.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.360
Laverne Brown Band.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.360
Right.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.360
But when I phoned up the echo.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.360
Because they used to do a publication for the weekend.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.360
I booked it as Laverne Brown Band and Spasm Band.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.360
Right.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.360
But they were rival bands.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.360
They didn't kind of get on and play together.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.360
Avoid each other.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.360
But Spasm Band were playing somewhere else.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.360
And their gig finished early.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.360
So they just turned up.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.360
And both crowds were there.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.360
And then the crowd turned up.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.360
And we had a wicked night.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.360
It was jammed.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.360
We couldn't move in there.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.360
By 11 o'clock it was empty.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.360
By half past 11.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.360
I opened the door.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.360
And I said, we've got a queue.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.360
Next thing you know, it was full.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.360
Non-stop.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.360
So good things come out of it.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:00.360
The thing about the castle that I remember more than anything else is.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.360
It was neutral territory.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.360
You know as someone on the door.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.360
Yeah.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:09.360
But the curses stopped when people walked in the door.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.360
And it didn't matter what you did as a living.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.360
You know, speaking about some of the ladies.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.360
Then you were treated with respect.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.360
Or you or a person bothering you left.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.360
Yep.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.360
That always impressed me.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.360
You know, it was just.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.360
Everybody was treated with respect.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.360
If they acted with respect.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.360
Very true. Very, very true.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.360
And it's something, you know.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.360
You give and you get back.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:42.360
But that's a skill for someone on the door.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.360
That is a real skill.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.360
And if you had a problem take it outside and sort it.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.360
End of story.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.360
There we are.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.360
And we grew up with the Mardi Gras.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:58.360
And we had a week of full events in the youth club and the community centre.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.360
Chalky White's place was special wasn't it?

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.360
You know what I mean?

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.360
Unbelievable.

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.360
Brilliant times.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.360
Kids don't have that kind of place nowadays.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.360
And he was a special man.

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.360
Because he was a great leader.

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:20.360
You know, a lot of people would say little bitchy things.

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.360
Because they didn't understand how we operated.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.360
And everybody wanted their own piece of the pie basically.

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:28.360
But at the end of the day.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.360
He did a lot for our community.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.360
A lot.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:36.360
And me resting in peace and ultimate respect to him.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.360
For the man he was.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.360
People like Chalky White, Betty Campbell.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.360
Betty Campbell, yep.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.360
They were leaders.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.360
And my saying is leaders lead.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.360
Yeah.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.360
And it's not about them.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.360
That's the thing.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.360
They always look forward about the kids and where they're going.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.360
What you can do.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.360
Yep.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.360
A lot of people were told by Chalky White or Betty Campbell.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.360
You can be something.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.360
Do this. Yep. You can do it.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.360
Betty always proved it.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.360
Because she was my mentor.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.360
And sorry, not my mentor.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.360
When you go for a job.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.360
Reference.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.360
Always.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.360
So any job I got.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.360
I got with thanks to Betty.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.360
Because she was always my referee.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.360
And always put on a good reference for me.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.360
But she was honest about it.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.360
She was honest about it recently.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.360
Yes, she was lots of people's referees.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.360
But she wouldn't lie.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.360
No, no, no, no.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.360
If you messed up, you'd have to go and see her.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.360
At the end of the day.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.360
And she'd tell you a script.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.360
And there was another lady like that.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.360
May you rest in peace.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.360
Aubrey Laskins.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.360
Yeah.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.360
Who's his mother.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.360
She was a teacher in the school.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.360
Same time as Betty.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.360
And she was very, very, very strict.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.360
Per se.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.360
Yeah.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.360
Karen mentioned her as well.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.360
Wonderful lady.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.360
One of the questions I guess is.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.360
We all got grandkids or kids or whatever.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.360
And you think.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.360
Are those.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.360
Is it possible now.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.360
For those teachers to be that way.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.360
Do you know what I mean?

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.360
Betty Campbell didn't have to worry about.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.360
People's parents.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.360
You know the parents would say.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.360
She's in your care.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.360
That's right.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.360
You decide.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.360
None of this.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.360
My child didn't do it.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.360
And if you disrespected your teachers.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.360
You didn't want to go home either.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.360
No.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.360
You know the one I always found.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.360
If you've done something wrong.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.360
I didn't like.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.360
I don't know.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.360
We used to go over the docks.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.360
Yeah.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.360
Occasionally as a child and you weren't supposed to.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.360
And someone seeing you that knew your family.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.360
Would go and tell your family.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.360
So you're getting home.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.360
And your parents already know.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.360
Before you got home.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.360
And you're thinking.

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.360
Well how do they know.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.360
Who's seen me.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.360
Because that was it.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.360
Without confronting you about it.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.360
But they were also looking out for you.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.360
Because you were being somewhere you shouldn't have been.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.360
And then.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.360
Parents will tell you off.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.360
Or keep you in or ground you.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.360
And if there was something serious.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.360
Then you would have been licked.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.360
Yeah.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.360
These things happen.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.360
We won't say whether they're right or wrong.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.360
Licks.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.360
Yeah we've talked about those all day.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.360
So I've got to the end of my notes.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.360
I mean Richard.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.360
I mean.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.360
Richard.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.360
I mean.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.360
Richard thank you.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.360
You're welcome.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.360
I mean the point is.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.360
And I'll say this.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.360
I'll be saying this on every single one.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.360
If somebody is sat at the Norwegian church.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.360
Having a coffee.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.360
In better times.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.360
And they're looking across at those nice restaurants.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.360
And all the rest of it.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.360
They're going to understand.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.360
These were real people.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.360
And what you read about them.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.360
I mean it's not a script.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.360
Where you've got people like Neil Sinclair.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.360
You know.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.360
But it isn't written by them.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.360
And one of the things that struck me the other day.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.360
Was the smells.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.360
You know if you were walking.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.360
Through.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.360
Through the bay.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.360
And cafes.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.360
You know.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.360
You could eat around the world.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.360
In one little place.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.360
Definitely.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.360
And you could cook for like seven different people.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.360
At meal times.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.360
And then outside families would come in.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.360
Because you know.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.360
So and so is working.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.360
Or my mother's babysitting this one.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.360
And so we would maybe have.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.360
12 or 14 people at the table.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.360
Or sit-ins.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.360
Crazy.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.360
But like you say.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.360
You could eat from around the world.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.360
Because there were so many different cultures.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.360
I can remember my nan.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.360
My family.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.360
My family were over.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.360
Over Barry from the cold cot.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.360
Originally Thompson Street we were from.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.360
And I can remember my nan.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.360
Was totally.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.360
Bermused when she got older.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.360
Because she was cooking for just her.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.360
And my uncle.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.360
She couldn't cook for two people.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.360
She didn't know how.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.360
Yes.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.360
Because they used notes.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.360
And if you had money.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.360
You could have a match on the table.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.360
Because someone else.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.360
To just say to somebody.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.360
Oh we got spare if you want something to eat.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.360
Because they had nothing at that moment.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:55.360
That's that thing of coming from merchant navy families.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.360
Somebody's just got off a ship with a couple of Bob.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:01.360
Somebody else hasn't got any money.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.360
And the women ran it.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.360
The women ran it.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.360
Went off to docks.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.360
My mother was five foot four.

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.360
A little pocket rocket.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.360
Strong woman.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.360
So she raised nine kids.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.360
Yeah.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.360
People don't realize just how many.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.360
How many men disappeared from the.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.360
On the merchant.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.360
In both wars.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.360
And it was the women who kept it going.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.360
Had to be there didn't they?

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.360
Yeah.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.360
Somehow we need to show them that respect.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.360
Somehow you know there's a.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.360
People talk about statues.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.360
It would be nice if there was a statue of.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.360
A mother.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.360
Just a mother.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.360
Without a face.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.360
Yeah and a lot of people would be confused.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.360
Because they think.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.360
They see the bay and the docks as being black.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.360
But you know there's.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.360
Many many many of the women that brought us up were white.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.360
Or a mixed origin.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.360
Yeah and their nans were.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.360
You know what I mean.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.360
Yeah.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.360
My nan on my.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.360
My nan on my mum's side and my father's side.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.360
Yeah and they ran it.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.360
They did it.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.360
Yeah.

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.360
Those are good memories.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.360
Those are good memories.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.360
So if just having a chat about them.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.360
Is taking you back to there a bit.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.360
Then I'm pleased.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.360
Yes we've done a good job.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.360
You've triggered my memory going.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.360
And these times.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.360
We need to go back a bit and look at those times.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.360
And go yeah it was hard then.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.360
We did it.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.360
Yes.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.360
And here we are.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.360
Still standing.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.360
Okay thanks mate.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.360
I'm great.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.360
Brilliant.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.360
Good job.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.360
Take care.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.360
Peace be with you.
