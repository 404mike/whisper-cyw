You say sometimes you watch with friends, particularly sports.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Would you ever watch in a public place or is it still home-based?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I have done, on occasion. A couple of years ago, I think it was either the Lions or the World Cup, I can't remember now.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We went down in the morning to the local pub and watched the games.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Gosh, was it the Lions or was it Wales? I can't remember.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
But I went down a few times and I have gone for some home internationals to the pub.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I don't particularly like it. I prefer watching it at home.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
When I'm in a pub, you know, you have a couple of drinks, even if it was early in the morning, you have a couple of drinks.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And you really don't concentrate. I like being at home. I like concentrating.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.000
You listen to the comments at half-time. So I prefer watching at home, but with friends. A few of us together.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
How does watching at home compare with actually being in the game?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Oh, it's not the same. When I was younger, I would certainly never choose to watch it at home as opposed to going to the game.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I loved going to the game. And even now, you know, it is great being there.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
But as I'm getting older, I'm getting more inclined now to stay at home.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And with the prices of the tickets, it's crazy.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It really is hitting the ordinary rugby supporter who supports his local club week after week.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And that costs money. And then to have to pay Â£70 or so to go and see Wales, I think it's unfair.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I think it's too much, but that's my personal opinion.
