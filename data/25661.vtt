00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400
Track 10. Ditch blocking. It is a fantastic story just by sending a little digger down

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.240
there. In the weird and wonderful world that we live in, it seems funny that today's farmers

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.360
are being paid to undo the work they did in the years after the Second World War. Here

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.180
at Glass Lynn on the Begallion Estate and elsewhere the Pimliman project is busy blocking

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:33.580
ditches and re-wetting areas of blanket bog. As Clive explains, our knowledge and needs

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.420
are different today. I guess you've got to accept the fact that times change and what

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:45.780
society needs changes. What we'd like to do is help the farmers to prevent floods and

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.860
to lock up the carbon, make sure the carbon is locked up in their hills in the landscape,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:59.100
The peat is a result of the dying back of vegetation that grows on the blanket bog and

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.540
if this vegetation is healthy and growing then the peat gradually gets deeper and deeper.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.260
That in itself helps to hold more carbon up here and a well-maintained peat bog also holds

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.660
an enormous amount of water. So how is a healthy bog maintained? Like many of the species found

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.020
here the work is subtle but no less important. What we're doing is we are coming up with

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.900
a three tonne digger and we're sending the digger down the ditches and they're scooping

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.660
out every now and again they'll scoop out a bit of the ditch and they'll use the peat

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.860
that they've scooped to make a pool and with the peat that they've dug out of the pool

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.020
they'll use to block the ditch and then they'll trundle on a bit and then they'll do the same

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.580
and of course the whole idea then is that instead of having a ditch which drains the

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.940
water out into the river causing the flood causing the peat to degrade suddenly you've

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:03.620
got a flooded pool. Beautiful for the dragonflies, beautiful for the little passage birds. So

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.100
what you end up with is a string of little pools and little bunds where once there was

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.460
a ditch and every time it rains the water seeps from one pool to the next it doesn't

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.340
gush it's held it's checked back and it stops that water gushing down into the streams into

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.460
the rivers and flooding our lowlands. So it's great you're making habitats for wildlife

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.860
you're preventing flooding in the lowlands and you're locking away carbon preventing

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.460
the emissions of greenhouse gases. It's a fantastic story just by sending a little digger

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.340
down there creating a minimal impact. You wouldn't even notice it if you didn't look

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.980
hard and yet providing those three fabulous services. So next time you hear a new story

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.580
concerning climate change or flooding perhaps you will think about the work taking place here

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.220
return in a few years time and you may even be able to notice the subtle changes taking place.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.380
We do hope you have enjoyed this audio trails production. Continue along the track for vehicles

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.620
bearing left at a fork and down to the cattle grid at the turn off to glass lane car park stop

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.980
four. Head past the point where you came in on Glyndwr's way and follow the very pothole track

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.060
all the way back to the mountain road crossing another cattle grid on the way and a final one

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.380
when you reach the road. You can of course retrace your steps past stops two and three

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.980
over Voilvadian if you want to but continuing on the main track is shorter and easier.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.260
When you reach the road take care crossing over then turn left and follow it down to the memorial

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.660
that will be on your left. Please take great care walking along this road as it gets quite busy at

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.420
times. Have a safe journey back to the memorial and then home. Goodbye.
