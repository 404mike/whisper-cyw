What does friendship mean to you? Could you tell me what it means to you?

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:16.720
Friendship to me means everything. It means someone you can phone up during the day,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.240
have a chat, have a natter, have a shoulder to cry on.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:32.480
Someone who knows you very well, someone you can rely on, someone you can trust

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.600
and will always be there for you.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.880
So today we've not been able to interview you with your close friend. Can you explain why that is

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.960
and who that person would have been?

00:00:48.240 --> 00:01:00.800
My best friend is Natasha. She lives in South Africa. She's the bestest friend I've ever,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:10.400
ever, ever had. She's like a family member to me. We do everything together, we laugh together,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:22.000
we share stories together, we enjoy each other's company and we just get on really well.
