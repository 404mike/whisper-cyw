00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
Can you describe the factory in Treforis?

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:11.240
Yes, well it was the units that were built by the government on the Treforis estate,

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.280
they all seemed to be of one design.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.800
They were very plain, nothing fancy at all, just a utilitarian building.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.340
I think it was about 7 or 8,000 square foot and the building was, it had offices at the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:35.300
front and it was divided roughly into half and the slightly bigger half, probably 55%,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.780
was devoted to cigarette paper and the other 45% was the box making division.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:49.060
And then when they built the new factory in 1946, that was again about another 8,000 square

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.660
foot on two stories which was added to the back.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.340
And then they moved all the production.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.220
By that time the box company had gone, that went in about 1943 when Mr. Wilhelm and my

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:10.900
father fell out and he took himself off up to I think Thunapia or somewhere up in the

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:19.100
valleys and then General Paper and Box just made cigarette paper and took over the whole buildings.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.700
Were the boxes, were they originally to make the containers for the cigarette papers?

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.980
No, no, no.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.780
They made boxes, well I don't know, you could put shoes in them, all that sort of thing.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.660
Although of course they didn't do so well in the war because on the one hand there was

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:43.540
very little new stuff being produced and the one thing that you didn't need was luxury boxes.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.780
So they did struggle a bit and the main revenue stream was from the cigarette paper.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.700
And why did they move to Jaffar?

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.460
Well, when you wanted to set up a company and you wanted government assistance as they

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.900
did, they wanted a factory, you were directed where to go and there were three options I

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.900
think.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.940
One was South Wales, one was Newcastle on Tyneside and the other was up in Scotland,

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.860
I think it was Cumbernauld where there was similar estates being built.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.820
They thought that the least worst was South Wales and that's why so many Jewish companies

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.140
set up in Treforest.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.620
Are you aware of any connection with South Wales before?

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.300
No, no, no, no.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.900
That was the only reason why we came here.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.620
I mean they would obviously much rather have gone to London or to one of the big centres

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.900
but that wasn't an option so we all came here.
