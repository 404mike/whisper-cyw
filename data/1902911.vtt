00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I was nine when the moon landings happened and what I remember is my mum being incredibly excited about everything that was going on.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And she organised for us to, I'm not sure if it was ours or whether she borrowed it, a small portable television.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.000
She put that in their bedroom and woke us up in the early hours of the morning of when it was happening to get us all down into their bedroom.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I can remember sitting on the end of the bed with mum and dad propped up on the pillows behind us and my brother and my sister either side of me.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And I was just so tired because it was the early hours, it was about half past two, three o'clock.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And all I can remember is sitting there thinking, oh, I just want to go back to sleep.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I don't understand what's happening because all you could see was a very grainy picture on the on the black and white television.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But my mum was adamant that we had to watch it because she said it's history in the making.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And she was absolutely right about that.
