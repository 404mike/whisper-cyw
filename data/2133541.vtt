00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.500
Can you tell us a little bit about what you do here at Chepstor Mencap?

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.500
I'm hoping we've been at the shop on the 13 mornings.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.000
So you volunteer at the shop?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000

I'm like selling stuff, being out, putting up clothes, put the cubes on.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:24.500
The shop had a change around and people like it.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So you say a change around, they're having a kind of a reshuffle are they?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Yeah.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
A revamp?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Mmm.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Nice, have you been involved in that?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Yes.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So have you given some, had some decisions on when things are gonna go?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000

You put the books on the shelf?

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.500
Yeah.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.500
What else do you do?

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.120
Yeah.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.120
We start cleaning, boxing in things down we do.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.120
That's good, so you also do other work on a Tuesday don't you?

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.120

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.120
Where else do you do that?

I don't, I don't do it at Time Driver anymore, I don't, I don't, I don't do it.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.300
You do the pop-up, I was talking about the pop-up cafe.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.300
Yeah.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.300
That's why, you volunteer at that as well.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.300
Yes.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.300
So where do we host the pop-up cafes?

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.300
At the, at the, the board school.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.480
Is that something you help with as well, do you know?

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.480
I've not done it.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.480
You haven't done it?

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.480
No.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.480
No, is it something you'd like to do?

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.480
Yeah.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.480
Do you know what Tom does at the pop-up cafe?

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.480
Yeah, I only clean up.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.480
You want to clean up?

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.480
Yeah.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.480
Well that could be something you could do then, if we could arrange it.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.480
Yeah.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.480
I think it's because it's not on a day that you come here.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.480
Ah right, okay, but sometimes you pop in to see your brother, don't you?

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.480
Yeah.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.660
When he's working.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.660
I think, Gina.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.660
Yeah.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.660
What day do you go to the shop and board?

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.660
Tuesday.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.660
Ah, there we go.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.660
That's why.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.660
So you're working at the shop when Tom's in the pop-up cafe?

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.660
Yes, I forgot, because I'm out on a Tuesday.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.660
So tell me more about the pop-up cafe, Tom, and what do you do here?

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:34.840
I'm serving, all cleaning, I do clean, get the dirty mugs, take them into the kitchen,

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:42.020
put in, being to wash up, or putting in the dish washer.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.020
Yeah.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.020
I do.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.020
So you do kind of like a waiter and a chef.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.020
Yes.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.020
And a bit of everything.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.020
Yeah.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:59.020
So I've also noticed on the photos, the pop-up cafe, you've got a lot of people who are working

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.020
at the shop.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.020
Yes.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.020
How do you decorate it?

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.020
Does it change all the time?

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.020
Yes.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.020
Yeah?

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.020

I do my money on Facebook.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.020
You saw it with mum on Facebook?

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.020
You look on Facebook.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.020
Yeah.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.020
And you see the photos.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.020
The shop.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.020

What do you do?

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.020

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.200
And Tom works at the pop-up and the shop.

I do everything.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.860
What do you like about meeting the customers?

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:44.860
Yeah.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:45.860
Do you like meeting the customers?

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:46.860
Yeah.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.860
And why do you like it?

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.860
Because I do it every Tuesday.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.700
And so do you see people quite often?

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.700
Are they regulars?

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.700
Yeah.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.700
And have you got to know their names?

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.700
Yeah.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.700
And in turn, have they got to know your name?

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:08.700
Yeah.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:09.700
You're quite popular in Bournemouth.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.700
Yeah.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:11.700
Everyone knows you if I'm coming in the shop.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.700
Yeah.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:13.700
You give them a warm welcome.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.700
Yeah.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:19.700
So if I was a customer coming into the shop.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.700
Yeah.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:27.540
And I said to you, I'm going to a party and I want to wear something smart.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.540
Yeah.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.540
What would you show me in the shop?

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.540
Party stuff.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.540

So do you sell?

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.540
Party stuff.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.540
Like smart clothes and suits and stuff like that?

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.540
Yeah.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.540
Nice.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.540
And I've heard, if I'm not sure.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.540
Yeah.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:49.540
Do you take up a treat for Elaine every Tuesday?

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:50.540
Yeah.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.380
What treat do you take her?

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.380
Cake.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.380
Cake?

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.380
Every Tuesday.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.380
Do you make the cakes?

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.380
Well I can't believe that.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:03.380
Yeah.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.380
I was making...

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:09.380
You make a cake and you take it up for you and Elaine.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.380
Yeah.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:17.380
Well that's very kind and a lovely thing to do at the beginning of your shift.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.380
That's really good.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:29.220
So I think that both of you have been coming to Chepstow Man Cap for over five years.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.220
Yeah.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.220
And do you want to say where you moved from?

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.220
From the Bristol.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.220
From Bristol.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.220
From Bristol.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.220
We moved from...

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.220
I knew it.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.220
From...

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.220
In the big house now.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:49.220
From Bristol to Chepstow.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.060
Right.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.060
And you brought...

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.060
Your mum and dad brought a house in here.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:03.300
Mm-hmm.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.300
I went to the service.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:05.860
Shh.

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.700
You speak up a little bit, mate.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.780
I went to the service.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:10.820
You were a server?

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:11.220
Yeah.

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:12.980
What did you serve?

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.340
I did the candles.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.020
Oh, you did the candles.

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:20.260
Lovely.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:21.940
Yeah.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:23.380
And did you enjoy doing that?

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:23.780
Yeah.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:25.940
So it sounds as if...

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:26.660
Yeah.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.300
...the church...

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:27.620
Yeah.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:30.820
...I presume it was every week...

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:31.140
Yeah.

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:33.780
...and it sounds as if you...

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:34.100
Yeah.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.420
...really enjoyed doing that.

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:36.820
Yeah.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:37.220
Yes.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:38.500
Yeah.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:40.740
Okay.

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:41.300
Yes.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.020
And is that where your love of music came from?

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:44.580
Yeah.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:44.980
Yes.

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:46.100
Yeah.

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:50.100
Doesn't your mother play some instruments as well?

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.660
I'm clarinet.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:56.180
My mum used to play the...

00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.140
...clarinet.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.140
Clarinet?

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:01.460
Yeah.

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:03.380
And?

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.100
Yes.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:05.140
I've just remembered.

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:05.540
Yeah.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:05.860
Yeah.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:08.820
What does your father do with music?

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:10.660
Drum.

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.300
Drum study.

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:13.620
Yeah.

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:14.340
A drummer?

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:14.660
Yeah.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:15.300
Yeah.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.700
And what type of band is he in?

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.220
Jazz band.

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:24.660
Jazz band?

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:24.900
Yeah.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:25.860
Jazz band.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:26.740
That's cool.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:27.060
Yeah.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:28.340
Oh, wow.

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:28.820
Yeah.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.420
So your parents are pretty cool.

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:30.740
Yeah.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.900
Do you guys play any instruments?

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:33.780
No.

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:34.260
No.

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:34.580
No?

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:36.020
No.

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.860
You've got a good singing voice though, haven't you?

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:38.500
Yeah.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:38.740
Yeah.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:40.900
Nice.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.420
You're a musical family then.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.380
Yes.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:44.260
That's lovely.

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:44.580
Yes.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.860
But you like listening to music.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:48.500
Yeah.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:48.740
Yeah.

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.340
We saw a brass band the other day, didn't we?

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:53.780
Brass band.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:54.180
Yeah.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:55.140
He was there.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:01.540
I was there and who was it and where was it?

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.340
In the whole street.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.940
Whole center of Chepstow.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:09.860
Chepstow High Street.

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:10.420
Yeah.

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:11.940
So what was the band playing for?

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.700
The soldiers.

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:16.340
Soldiers.

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.060
Soldiers, yes.

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.260
The rifles parade.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:18.820
Yeah.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.900
Rifles parade.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.220
So that was one of our social evening activities.

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:23.620
Yeah.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:24.180
Yes.

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:26.020
We all went to watch the rifles.

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:27.940
Mommy and daddy were there.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:28.740
Yes.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.340
Mom and dad went down to watch as well.

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:30.980
Yeah.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:31.300
Yeah.

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.220
Where did we go afterwards?

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:38.020
I went to see the weather spoons.

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.460
We did for a couple of pints.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:39.860
Yes.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:41.540
It was nice.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.220
I think it was quite a nice evening.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:45.060
Yes, it was, yeah.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:46.740
And what did you drink, Tom?

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:47.460
Well, a beer.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.900
Two pints of beer.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.500
Two pints of beer.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:51.380
Yeah.

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:51.780
Yes.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.900
I'm drinking my prongies today.

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:55.860
Right.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:57.620
That's okay.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:57.940
Yeah.

00:25:58.580 --> 00:25:58.900
Yeah.

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.620
So you had two pints of beer.

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:01.940
Yes.

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.460
It sounds like a jolly night out.

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:06.260
Yes.

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.940
We have some good fun on the night out.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:08.900
We do, don't we?

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:09.700
Yes.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.780
So what other nights do you do with Mencap?

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:12.980
What else have you been to?

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:16.260
I've been to the river bank twice.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.380
Today I went to the river bank.

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:20.660
Into the river bank?

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:21.140
Yeah.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.020
Today?

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.020
And you're coming next week, aren't you?

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:24.740
Yes.

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.180
We're going to have a barbecue evening, then.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:26.500
Yes.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.140
If we got nice weather, that should be good.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:29.380
Yeah.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.740
Which means, how much is it?

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.180
How much is it?

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:35.140
Three pound each.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:35.620
Yeah.

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:38.900
Which means we can get some snacks, food, a couple of drinks.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:39.540
Yeah.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:40.340
Yes.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.380
Where from?

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:42.820
Tesco.

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:43.380
Tesco.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:43.860
Tesco.

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:44.260
Tesco.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:44.820
Yeah.

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.860
Well, we went over the road.

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.860
So the other night, we all went out together as well, didn't we?

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:50.180
Yeah.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:52.180
Do you remember to the restaurant?

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:53.220
Yeah.

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.220
Where was the restaurant we went?

00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:00.180
Judy and Diana came.

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:01.220
Yeah.

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.780
Judith and Diane came, didn't they?

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.180
Yes.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.020
Was it the Piercefield?

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.220
Piercefield, yes.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:08.180
Yeah.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:09.380
Can you remember what you guys had?

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.420
Did you have a bar snack?

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.540
I can remember what Tom had, because I was envious.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.100
You had a beautiful rump steak.

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:24.820
Yeah.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.660
Oh, it looked so good.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:26.980
Yes.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.100
I had gamond.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.380
You had gamond, didn't you?

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:29.620
Yeah.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.660
So yeah, you guys quite like going out to eat, don't you?

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:33.380
Yes.

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:34.740
And you do quite often.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.060
Yeah.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.900
I'll tell you, in the evening, that I thought was rather different.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:41.860
Yes.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:42.100
Yeah.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:48.180
I don't know if both of you were there, but did you go to circus school?

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:48.580
Yes.

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:54.820
That's on a Monday.

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:56.100
That's right.

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.820
Yeah, we joined the community circus girls, didn't we?

00:27:58.820 --> 00:27:59.300
Yes.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.540
So did you enjoy that?

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:02.100
Yes.

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.220
I thought it was great fun.

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:03.620
Yeah.

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:05.380
Yeah.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.140
What, so tell us what you did at that event.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.140
I was spinning the plates.

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:10.420
Spinning plates?

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:12.420
Yeah, you were great at that.

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.620
You kept it up there for at least five minutes.

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:16.100
Yeah.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.460
I can believe it was still going.

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:24.340
I was doing, pulling the...

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:32.420
Yeah, so what Tom's showing us now is the action of pulling the sheet

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.420
underneath the dinner set, wasn't it?

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:34.660
Yeah.

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:40.580
So you did the quick pull of the dinner cloth.

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:40.820
Yeah.

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:42.980
Tablecloth, that's the one.

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:43.780
Yeah.

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.260
And did they all smash on the floor?

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.300
No, you nailed it, didn't you?

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:50.980
Yeah.

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.940
And we had to go juggling, didn't we?

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:54.340
Yes.

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.220
And what else did we try?

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:00.980
We tried a bit of poi, flag spinning.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:02.660
It was good fun, wasn't it?

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:03.140
Yes.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:11.380
So what else have you guys done with us in the evenings?

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:13.860
You come quite often, don't you?

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:14.180
Yeah.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.700
Make some...

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:20.740
The hatchers.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:24.420
Say that again, sorry?

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:30.580
The hatchers we made.

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:31.700
I mean...

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:36.980
The...

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.780
Like, Chipped Bundy.

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:43.700
The hatchers...

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:45.140
Me?

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.340
Do you know what Tom means, mate?

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:48.580
Yeah.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:50.180
Can you tell me?

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.500
Making cookies.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.100
Ah, cookies, yes.

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:55.860
We had some cooking sessions, didn't we?

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:56.260
Yes.

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.180
We had a bacon session.

00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:58.580
Yes.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.180
Yeah, so we made cookies last time, didn't we?

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:02.580
Yes.

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:03.940
Which turned out lovely.

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:06.260
What did we make the time before?

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:07.620
Can you remember what we cooked the time?

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:09.060
Um, the hatchers.

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:10.900
Is it fajitas?

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:11.300
Yes.

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.340
Yeah, yes.

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.460
I thought that's what you meant.

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:14.180
Yeah, fajitas.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:15.380
We had a Mexican night.

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:15.700
Yes.

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:19.140
So we're all in the kitchen, prepping, cooking.

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:19.380
Yeah.

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.220
Eating it together.

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:21.540
Yeah.

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:24.420
So yeah, we get up to lots in the evenings, don't we?

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:24.660
Yeah.

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:30.100
Okay, battery's running low, so we're going to pause there, all right?

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:31.140
Yeah.
