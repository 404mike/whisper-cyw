WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.760
Yes, well you see, although we look back on the English and the Welsh, particularly in

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:22.560
Monmouthshire, it is bone-filt in Canada to be able to understand the Welsh, even if you

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.720
couldn't speak it too well, to understand it, and also the English, because as I say,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.080
my mother spoke very little English, my father spoke very little Welsh, although he was a

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:45.200
self-educated man and a good man, and he could sing Welsh like all the rest of us, and he

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.960
could sing French and we could sing Russian, but we don't understand after time what do

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.480
you sing. Now when it came to that, we used to play tricks on my mother, she would, if we didn't

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.640
want to do what she wanted us to do, she'd speak to us in Welsh and we'd answer her in English,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.160
and all kinds of tricks like that, and we didn't understand what she was saying if it was something

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:17.840
that we didn't want to do, but these are the things that in later life that you look back on

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.400
and say well when your own children try to do the same thing as you, say well I don't understand,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.160
we don't understand what you mean, so but we used to use it in reverse, that when we wanted

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.600
something from my mother, then we'd speak to her in Welsh and she'd give us the whole world,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:47.120
you see this is the value of even of bilingual, particularly in the Welsh and English where we

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:55.840
were. Now after I came out here, there was an unfortunate situation in Canada of depression

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:07.440
well the depression that they had here was to me, was to us, some of us, it was still heaven,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.520
considering what we had gone through in 1921 and 1926, the depression yet in the 30s was

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.800
was nothing compared to what we had gone through and how we had to live, but there was what served me

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.200
when you asked about Dean Welsh,

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.400
while they were building Eaton's building here in 1929 and the starting of the best hotel,

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.160
there was a sign on the contractors had a sign

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:54.240
on it, men wanted no Englishman need apply, so I was around with a few Englishmen, a couple of us

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:02.400
Welshmen, a few more Welsh than Scotsmen and they said well that's a funny sign, well I said that

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.920
doesn't make any difference to me, so I said I'll go over, so I went over to the office and I said

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.040
you're looking for men, well what can you do, I told them anything anybody else can do, I can do,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.760
but I see you've got a notice out there, he said well you're English aren't you,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.520
don't you know, and then I spoke to him in a bit of Welsh, I said no I'm not an Englishman,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:35.200
I'm a Welshman, so I got a job, you see just for a few days because the conditions on there were so

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.200
you was better off without the job than you was with the job, this is what they call a depression

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:50.480
in Canada, this is what I learned from a depression, a depression is something that is created

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.360
where although you work you're better off not working, that's what the depression is,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.880
because you could get a couple of meals a day you know from different places as a

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:10.160
salvaging army or something and this is a fact, this is a fact even after I got a job for the

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.480
city of Saskatoon, I sat down with people who were on relief with identically the same family that

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.280
I had and worked out what they paid in rent and what I paid in rent and what I bought

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.160
and they were better off than me and I was working 10 and 12 hours a day, seven days a week

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.040
for the city of Saskatoon, so you see

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:39.280
but I had one thing, I wasn't taking charity and that was one thing that I found out about

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.120
our people, the Welsh people when we came, we'd do anything but take the charity

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.280
because we were dead against charity because it was over the hill to the porters as far as we were

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:01.920
concerned, so these are some of the things when then they say as the first thing I said,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.880
well you're Welsh, well you must be a good singer, well the only, when they ask you why are all

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.200
Welsh people good singers, well all Welsh people are not good singers, that's for sure, that's the

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.240
myth and the other one is that if you want to be a good singer you've got to put in a lot of practice

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:30.400
and the reason, the only reason that I know is because Welsh people sing a lot, they put in a lot

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.440
of practice whether they actually go to a music teacher or whether they go to the choir or whether

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.120
they sing together on the street corner but the football game, things they don't do you, if the

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:48.320
Canadians were to do what the Welsh people do, some of their customs and this is what, this is

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.000
another reason why I'd like to see the culture broader, when you go to a football game, sing,

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:03.040
sing at the football game, I know this is spreading to Europe now and into England and Scotland

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:10.560
but it's thing at the game, when we go to another concert, you go to a concert, everybody sits there

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:20.880
either smoking or something, nobody starts up a song, you know, but only some of the Welsh

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.400
group will get together, we'll get together and go to a club, go to a legion club, who do you find

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.520
whether it's two Welsh people together, a choir sort of thing and it's proven here

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.720
and when you go away, when you're traveling, if you're getting with the Welsh people you sing

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:44.240
you see and I think these, this is the reason that the Welsh people are singing but Canadians

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.080
could be just as good as singers because a lot of old people can't read music, they don't know one

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.280
note from another but they learn off the person who's singing alongside them and if you sing long

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:02.080
enough you'll learn it and that's what I think is the one of the reasons why we should retain our

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:09.120
culture because singing, as I say in my opinion, singing has only in the last 200 years been a

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:15.920
culture with the Welsh people, has become prominent as a culture, there's no doubt about it that it was

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:24.160
there from time immemorial, this community either chanting together or praying together or singing

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:30.160
together has always been a part of our culture and I think that's what we should try and retain

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:39.680
because we, I don't know, I know when I brought the Welsh society when they asked me to say grace

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.640
one time I sang the grace and everybody said that's the first time we'd heard that for years,

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.760
you see, we sang the grace

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:56.240
praise God from whom all blessings flow

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:09.760
praise him all creatures here below praise him above in heavenly host

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:17.760
praise father son and holy ghost

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:31.760
be present at our table lord be here and everywhere adored

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:45.760
these mercies bless and grant that we may feast in paradise with thee

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:55.760
you see they don't do that anymore but we used to sing it every meal at home when we were children

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.600
when we were children would you sing it in English or in Welsh at home?

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:06.160
We'd say it mostly in English but sometimes in Wales all I could do was there, you know,

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:13.840
and in Wales where we were the visitor always had the choice of the grace

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:22.000
if there was someone came to our house for supper we'd ask them to say the grace, I used to say

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:29.840
because the reason for that was we knew ours let's learn theirs and there was this surprise

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:36.800
in how many different ways they were of blessing, you know, blessing the food and

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:44.800
these are the things that are missing now too we've lost all those we very rarely say grace in ours now

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.040
but the funny part about this when the children come that's the time we say it we don't say it

00:09:51.040 --> 00:10:01.440
if it's adults but when the grandchildren come I we do so we have tried but it's it's a lot of

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:11.600
things that that that enter into it at the festival again I would like to have seen you know a couple

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:18.320
of our children or children dressed in Welsh costumes. Which festival? The music festival

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:25.280
in Saskatchewan. You get on and like when when the Queen comes and things like that, you know,

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.440
should I tell you about the incident with the Queen?

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:41.040
The wife and I had an invitation down to from the Premier to meet the Queen in Regina a year

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:49.280
ago now July the 4th last year and I thought it was only 12 lunch so we had lunch and then after

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:56.160
the lunch he came around on the walk around and the Premier was with him we were the first couple

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:02.880
he walked across to and he said she said he said this is Mr Thayne and this is Mr Thayne she wanted

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:08.640
to know what I was from I told her from old Regina and wanted to know what I had been doing and I

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:14.240
told her I'm an organiser with the unions and now that I was with the senior citizens of Pantone

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:19.200
the Premier and we stopped and talked for for quite a while she was quite interested and

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:28.480
you see they you you seem to send something out

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:36.400
I don't know whether I'm an unusual but I find it a lot among a lot of old people

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:44.240
we built a self-confidence within ourselves and I think this I think this is good and

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.480
this is what we should to meet the Queen you know lots of people said after her

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:55.520
to meet the Queen I respect her in a position I hope she respects me that's all I that's all I

00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:02.800
ask from anybody my you know and I didn't fall over any chairs or anything else or scrabble

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:10.480
she speaks to me I speak to her she doesn't doesn't make any difference to me but these are the things

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:19.200
I think that that the Welsh people are losing and losing fast is that Welsh people have a terrific

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:30.720
amount of self-confidence as a nation they believe they can do everything anything and everything

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:36.240
we proved it in the armies in the with the with the Welsh regiments in the war if there was

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.880
anything to be done they'd do it they'd do it and I think that is one of the basic things of the

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:46.880
Welsh people when they take their when they're convinced that the thing to do is right what

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:54.080
they're going to do is right they'll do it you see and I think that's a part of our culture that is

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:59.600
is knowing the right from the wrong and we learned very young what was right from wrong the people

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.440
today I don't think often know the doings been right or wrong they're supposed to know what is

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:08.640
right and what is wrong but they don't know I think that's the problem but but I think the Welsh culture

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.480
was a part of that

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:18.320
you know you think for yourself to find out what you think it is right or wrong of course if you're

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:27.520
wrong you're pretty soon told but and is it good is it good that's the I think that's

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.680
all of my life anyway and all of the people that I've run into

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:42.080
with Welsh background or Welsh people is is is it for the good is it is it good if it's good

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:48.080
they'll be I did and if you look down through the people Welsh people in Canada and find out

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:55.280
the positions they held the jobs they've done after they've got them you know their life

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:04.080
it'll support it'll support what I say and now we've got to go on and build the new group

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:10.960
the new group then are the children of Welsh people who respect their Welsh background

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:18.000
to get an opportunity to speak their language be able to speak their language and know something

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.600
of the culture I think that that's the next move otherwise not only in Canada you're going to die

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:31.520
but it'll die in there but the fight is on over there I understand for the Welsh language to come

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.960
back in the school I don't want to see all and only Welsh language that'd be the most ridiculous

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:44.400
thing to do because the whole world is going to be anglicized before as far as that goes but we've

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:50.400
got to have these other languages on the side I know as much French as I do Welsh because

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:57.520
I've been in that environment but you learn it from the people because you want to converse

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:02.240
them they want to converse them you can converse with people if you want to but I'd like to be able

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:07.600
to converse with the with the Welsh people and I wouldn't want to teach Welsh language

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:14.160
just for the sake of saying well let's go in the corner and and and talk Welsh

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:20.800
because that's what's ruined some of the societies and that's what causes the division

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.800
is the few who can speak Welsh getting together and speaking Welsh in one corner

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:31.120
and ignoring the others that's one of the biggest problems that we had and that's what broke our

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:36.480
Welsh society there was no doubt about that was the ones who could speak Welsh would get together

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:45.760
and you know conduct half the business in Welsh and half in English so these are there are dangers

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:50.560
mine and that's one of the dangers you could split the group up that's what have broken up

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:56.400
the German groups here is because there was there was two there was the high and the low Germans and

00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:00.880
they'd get together and they'd speak even among themselves speaking German without a fellow like

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:13.680
me dropping in and speaking English

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:26.800
interview between Lewis Thomas and W.E. Davis of Regina on September the 1st 1970

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:36.080
okay an interview do you mind telling me how old you are Mr. Davis? I'm 75. 75 so you were

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:43.280
I was a little over seven when we came to this country when you came to the banger area well

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:50.800
not banger there was no banger that existed when we came here you see I see the railway that's there

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:57.440
now there was it was talked about but it it started it came through there in 1907

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:04.560
ah yes I see that's when banger first came see that district that is known as banger today

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:10.720
was first known as St. David ah yes yes in St. David there's the St. David school there that's

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:16.640
one of the school districts school districts and the St. David Anglican church there and that was

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:22.320
there before bangalore that's how early I think that was in established somewhere between four

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:29.360
and ninety four or five I believe ah yes so I'm not certain of that yes but uh during that time

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:35.200
there was that district was first known as St. David not Bangalore I see well that's very interesting

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:42.720
yes so you were born in Patagonia yes I was born there yes and uh were your parents um

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:50.720
among the first in Patagonia or did they come in in the uh in the 70s or 80s

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:58.080
my father was of course my grandparents my father was a little boy he wasn't quite six I see

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:05.840
they were amongst the first the first that came in 1865 1865 yes yes he was amongst the first there

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:12.480
well and like many of these voyages and all it had its tragedies yes

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:22.960
my grandmother father's mother he she died a few weeks after the landing well well and his father

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:30.720
in about two years so he and his brother were left alone I see they're amongst there's no relatives

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:37.120
nobody at all well and they were just left there entirely alone and his master's brother his

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:43.680
brother met with an accident and he was at the age of 14 the father was 12 well so he was entirely

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:51.920
alone from there on yes and my mother's uh they went there well they went they left Wales in 1880

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:58.400
but they didn't arrive in the well said in 81 in the spring of 81 they spent a few

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.440
months in outside of Buenos Aires

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:15.120
and my maternal grandfather he was out in BC here came out in 1862 yes they left Wales on December

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:23.920
the 22nd in 1862 of the rising sun I see and they arrived in the square of BC on the 13th of June

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:34.000
1863 well that was journey yes and uh what did he do there was he on the mining yes he went to

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:42.160
prospecting the line up to the caribou yes he was there until 1874 when he returned to Wales

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:48.240
yes I knew there were some Welsh people who went into the prospecting yes there's quite a number

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:54.480
of them and there was one amongst them uh Harry Jones and my mother talking about he was quite

00:19:54.480 --> 00:20:04.640
a young man well he he died in Victoria at the age of 95 or 1936 or 1937 I think well and he was

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:12.000
in amongst that group too with my grandfather's he and recently I've been able through this

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.200
journal again this year there's an article about him it's Harry Jones and there's a peak named

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:25.600
after him there's Jones peak in the caribou range well the name of the journal to which Mr Davies

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:39.440
is referring is YR capital E N F Y S the journal of the Welsh people outside Wales

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.680
the meaning of the title is the rainbow

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:54.640
well now Mr Davies what was your own occupation over the years was it farming farming yes

00:20:54.640 --> 00:21:02.880
farming yes and you farmed up until quite recently until well 10 years ago when we had to leave on

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.160
he was told to work

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:12.720
oh yes yes um can you tell me anything about the um

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:25.040
from your from hearing people talk about the previous occupations of the settlers who um

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:33.200
who went to Patagonia from Wales were they were there a variety of occupations represented

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:38.400
yes a variety that's I think was one of the big mistakes they're going out there

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:45.600
the idea of farming you know and there's hardly any of them that had any experience in farming at

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:54.160
all they're mostly miners and carpenters and so on but the grandfather he'd been farming of course

00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:03.920
Wales before going to somewhere but that was one great disadvantage yeah would you say from your

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:12.800
from hearing people talk that um the settlers were as nationalistic in their feeling as Michael Jones

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:20.320
was and the other organizers of the project well some of them I think well quite nationalistic yes

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:29.600
yeah do you recall the name Lewis Jones oh yes he was from my reading of the records the one who

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:40.720
who did the most to sort of publicize Patagonia in Wales yes he did he was apparently a great

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:49.680
speaker and a clever journalist I have a faint reflection about him you know he was still living

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:58.160
when we left yes and I well I remember seeing him as well but yeah of course of course the father

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:05.440
talking a lot about him the organizers of the colony Michael Jones and Lewis Jones and and their

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:15.520
friends really um had no clear impression of the nature of the country did they and the problems

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:22.800
that would face the settlers well it's apparent that they didn't you know one thing they landed

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:31.040
there in midwinter in july the 28th he was held on the mimosa yeah that's the name of the boat

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:41.360
and two months to the day they left on the 28th day of may 1865 and they landed on this bleak

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:51.360
and barren coast there and july the 28th yeah and they couldn't too late to get a crop in oh

00:23:51.360 --> 00:24:00.880
oh yes i was couldn't do anything yeah and see there were 40 miles from the valley and you cross

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:08.240
there and it's still today you can stand on that post today and all you can see is just stones and

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:16.400
and little short bushes we stood on there there's no gentleman there he's passed away recently now

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:23.440
he's in columbia bogota columbia and he stood there and my sister and i was standing there

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:30.080
looked and he looked out at this last you know just desert and he says i've seen enough with

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:40.560
this i don't want to see him he just died recently i had it yeah and he said he died yeah well i know

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:45.760
quite a bit about from my reading about the hardships which the settlers encountered

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.760
over the years and

00:24:54.240 --> 00:25:03.520
i am interested however in in the situation that developed in the 1890s by by that time as i

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:08.960
understand it the the welch pioneers had proved the

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:18.400
the agricultural potential of the area if water was applied through irrigation oh yes and

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:29.520
the result was they they had proved that it was a productive area and argentinians began to move

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:37.600
into the province and and i guess some italian immigrants by this time too yeah and this created

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:44.000
of course a new situation for the welch didn't it oh yes it did yes yeah

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:57.440
was there was there any intermarriage at that time or has it taken place to any extent since

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:07.360
oh yes to a great extent since yes at that time no matter what they were there for

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:17.360
10 years from 1865 until 1875 before any joined them in that policy they were there for 10 10 years

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:25.360
and that's where there's quite a few making mistakes about this group that came out from

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:35.120
patagonia to canada here they said that they'd spent 37 years there they didn't see there's only

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:42.000
two that came out here in 1902 that had been landed there in 1865 that's my father and then

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.600
the mother david hughes but david hughes he returned after five years he returned to south america in

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:53.520
1907 he returned so so we're the only ones the rest of some of them had only been there

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:57.360
i was all of course i would even want my father mother was saying you know that they'd only been

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.760
there three or four years some of them they came out to canada some of them had been 10 some of

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:08.320
them had been 15 some of them up to 20 years or more but the only two that came out here

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.880
and we were we were trying to find out when we got back there now they weren't able to find

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:21.040
that anybody in canada besides us my sisters and i that have direct descendants if you'll be

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.840
in the world

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:36.160
now of the group that that came to canada there were two there were approximately 250

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:41.440
who sailed on that ship were you with that with the main group yes we were that ship well this is

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:48.480
coming to women and children yes well according to a book i haven't got here now with my sister

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:52.160
it's written by a man there on the banks of the tuba

00:27:54.800 --> 00:28:02.160
and according to him that was 234 to be exact but we were not all welsh there was

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:09.520
like and he called me two english families and there was one scotsman there and one

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:15.040
and you wouldn't dare say anything about him in english spanish otherwise either

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:25.280
there's one of those english families that came over her children that were

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.360
quite a size you know in the 14 and 15 years they speak welsh

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:38.560
well the mother was completely english she was from lancaster and the father was an irishman

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:46.560
they could speak welsh yeah now most of the most of the group who came to canada of course

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:53.360
would have been farming in in patagonia most of them yes there'd perhaps be a few tradesmen

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.360
uh

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:16.320
do you recall um whether any serious consideration was given by the group

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:24.640
to settling in the irrigated lands of southern alberta i'm not aware of that at all

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:33.280
it would have uh in some senses seemed a logical place to go because of their experience in that

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:40.480
type of farming yes and similarly of course they had been very successful ranchers your people in

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:53.760
in the schubert area yeah um my guess is that they uh they didn't uh go to southern alberta

00:29:54.640 --> 00:30:06.560
because uh irrigation land was costly to acquire and uh the ranches by that time had been largely

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:11.520
broken up into small holdings and there wasn't as much homestead land

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:19.120
available in southern alberta as there was in this part of saskatchewan at the time would you

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:25.600
feel that's a fair uh estimate possibly i don't know i never heard any talk of that at all you

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:31.040
know but if you we came out with saw coats there of course that was as in the way of northwest

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:38.480
yeah and there was a farmer there well he'd been in south america and he'd come to canada

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:44.160
all eight or nine years ahead of us by the name of evan jenkins yes i remember seeing that name

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:54.000
here i think some do with it and well mostly there was four townships had been reserved for

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.360
a vals supplement before we came out well after this conversation taking place between the

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:07.360
government of britain and get these out of satagonia you know there

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:19.520
yeah yeah um do you recall uh whether um the settlers felt they had been reasonably well

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:25.680
treated by the canadian authorities in the in the handling of
