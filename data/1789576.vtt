00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
Okay I just have to say at the top that I'm Marcia Marnie and with Adrian Williams at

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.800
the Fishery Goldcliff and it's Monday the 1st July 2019.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.440
I'm just going to put that there and I wonder Adrian if you can just start off, can you

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.840
just maybe introduce yourself?

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:29.160
I'm Adrian Williams, I was the last butcher fisherman of the Welsh butcher fisheries.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.960
There are some left still but they're in England not in Wales.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.360
So what brought your family here?

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.480
Just give us the background to that.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.520
My father, my grandfather ran the Beechley Oust ferry.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.120
When the Severn Bridge was announced they looked for alternative venues for bridges

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.760
or crossings of some kind up and down the Severn Estuary.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.680
When the Goldcliff fisheries became available it was one of the parcels of ground along

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.880
with the business that they purchased in the early 1960s after they discovered that the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.280
Severn Bridge was to make the ferry defunct.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.280
So what was it, their names?

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.280
What were their Christian names?

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.560
My grandfather was Enoch Williams, my father was John Williams.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.160
Enoch, wow, where were they from?

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:35.840
My father was born in Newport when my grandfather was an architect for the Newport Borough Council

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.480
and my grandfather was originally from Bonny Mine in Swansea.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.560
So what, I'm going back a bit, but what took them to, you know, what led them to running

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.560
the Oust ferry?

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:56.840
My grandfather was an entrepreneurial person who saw that there was a possibility of creating

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:05.840
a passenger ferry between Beechley and Oust and he had the dream of doing it and had eventually

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.780
got to the point where he was able to finance it with some outside help after he'd worked

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.760
for a few years as an architect.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:23.880
He started the Beechley Oust ferries in the late 1920s and then they started carrying

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:32.040
cars as cars became more prolific and it went from there to when they were closed down

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.680
to having three ferries which used to carry 15 or 16 cars per ferry and obviously history

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.960
shows that if they were still doing it today they'd need more than three ferries, that's

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.160
for sure.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.760
So the ferries, I mean, you were telling me a story last week about the last ferry, what

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.320
happened to the, is there one still remaining or is there one still at Chapstow?

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.720
There's one still at Chapstow on the river side, it's been pulled up out of the river

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.880
and it's just up on top of the bank underneath the railway bridge in Chapstow which they're

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:19.520
looking for a permanent site for, the Seven Princesses and there's a restoration project

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.600
going onwards to try and put it back to a part where they can actually use it like a

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:35.840
bandstand type thing or a display of some kind in the new development of the Mabee site,

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.000
the Fairfield Mabee site in Chapstow.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:45.120
So when they purchased the fishery, when they purchased the fishery, I want to hold that

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.120
up a little bit, did they have any knowledge of fishing?

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.120
No.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:57.120
My grandfather was a keen angler, he was a trout fisherman, he would catch trout, he

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.120
used to have fishing rights on certain rivers in Wales, because my grandfather was a very

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.440
keen fly fisherman, but he had no salmon fishing experience or anything to do with commercial

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.440
fishing.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.440
So what was their knowledge of this place, this fishery before they came, do you know?

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.440
Not really, no, they just knew it was on the side of the river and if it was on the side

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.440
or near the river then they bought it, that was the rule of thumb really.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.440
So I just wonder if that's going to get in the way of the river.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.440
Right, OK.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.440
What's he doing?

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.440
He's mowing.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.440
He's mowing in the field, is he?

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.440
Er, the side bit.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.440
Actually, can I come and sit there?

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.440
Yeah, sure.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.440
That might be better.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.440
That might be better.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.440
No, you won't be there long.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.440
Erm, yeah that's better, that is much better.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.440
So, do you have any knowledge of the previous owners?

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.760
Only that they also ran the fishmongers in Newport.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:16.320
They were Burgess who had the fishmongers where Marks and Spencer's in Newport town

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:23.320
centre used to be and they demolished the existing buildings and built the new Marks

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:29.200
and Spencer's, which would have been in the 50s I guess, I'm not sure.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:36.960
And prior to that the owners were people called fennel and fennels were actually tenants

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.960
to Eden College.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.960
Eden College were the actual owners for the majority of the period of time of the fisheries

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:52.960
and they were given the fisheries by Henry VIII at the time of the dissolution of the

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.960
monasteries.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.720
So, when your grandfather and father brought the fishery here, do you remember that?

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.720
Well, I was four years old.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.720
So, what's your earliest memory of it?

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.720
That's a good question.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.720
It's a bit of a blur really because I've done it so many times before but I used to

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.480
come down with my mother mostly because she was the one that used to come to collect the

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:31.480
fish and take the fish to the station or to wherever we had to take it.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:40.480
We'd come through before the motorway was built, obviously before the M4 was built.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:47.480
So, it would have been 1965, 1966 when we'd have to come through all the lanes from Chapstow

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.240
to Goldcliff.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:56.240
I remember having to travel that road which wasn't the best and then we'd go down to get

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.240
the fish in the old Land Rover which was very unique.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:08.240
We were probably one of the only commercial fisheries that used to go to work in a Land

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.240
Rover.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.240
Go fishing in a Land Rover was the term I suppose.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.240
Did you bring it down there?

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.240
Yeah, we used to drive it down round the corner.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
How did you get it from here?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Down round there and it's all hard, it's all rocks which every spring we'd make it so you

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
could compact it down and then when you get just down in front of the fence on what we

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.000
call the mile, mile being a local terminology for a very hard clay and it's almost like

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
rock but it's not hard rock but you can drive vehicles on it no problem and that's what

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:52.760
we used to drive the Land Rover round and go down and then look in all the baskets and

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.760
what you and your men?

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:04.760
Mr Howells the fisherman and also we had another chap who was called John Newton, local farmer.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.240
He used to help out as well.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:13.760
When Mr Howells, Wyndham Howells was getting older he wasn't able to drive the vehicle

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.720
so John Newton used to drive the vehicle.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:22.440
So you come down here, there's a slipway here, drive round to the ranks and then would you

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.440
have to climb up the ranks?

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.440
Yeah, depending on where the fish was.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:32.440
If it was up on the top tier there was rails and posts and you'd step on the rails and

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:39.440
post like a ladder and then we used to use a tool like a stick with a prong on the end

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.440
of it and the prong used to be put into the fish's mouth and then you'd force the fish

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:49.080
backwards with the stick so you could just about reach the tail of the fish from the

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.400
other side of the basket so you'd have to remember where the fish was because sometimes

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.440
they'd slip down again and then you'd have to go back round again and push it again and

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.300
sometimes it'd slip back again and you'd have to go round again so sometimes it was a bit

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.300
of a nuisance.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.300
Take a few times.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:08.440
Yeah and other times you'd push it too far and it would flop out on the ground which

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:13.200
we didn't want to do that because it would get all muddy and also it might bruise the

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:20.200
fish a bit so we used to use a stick with a special V in it.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.200
Like something you'd use on the barbecue?

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.200
Yeah, it was about six foot long.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.200
Oh wow.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:34.560
Yeah, so you could push the fish quite a considerable way back because the baskets themselves were

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.520
about five foot long.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.160
So you were going to the narrow end?

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.880
Yes.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.880
And then pushing it back that way?

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.880
Yeah.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.880
Okay, I see.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.640
Well you'd have to find the fish to start with because the baskets, because they were

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:52.360
silver they were made of aluminium in the last few years of the fishery.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:58.480
We had aluminium rather than withy or wicker baskets.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:03.920
So the fish weren't that easy to see especially if there was a lot of, you used to get a lot

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.440
of kelp, a lot of seaweed.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.280
And if there was a lot of kelp about then it would be very, very difficult to see the

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.280
fish.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:16.800
So sometimes if you had fish about then you would have to go and push through the kelp

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:23.240
to check there wasn't a fish in the basket because it was so full of seaweed.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.000
So you had to check each every basket.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.880
More often than not there wasn't that much kelp about.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.080
So a lot of baskets to check though?

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.800
Well, 2,300 when I first took it over, yeah.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.800
Wow.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.880
So how many ranks was that?

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.360
Well it was three ranks in total.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:50.320
As time went by the stocks got less and less and the price of the license went up per basket.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:55.800
I identified what I thought was the best part of the fishing and I only did that part of

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.800
the fishing.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.800
I didn't do the bits where we didn't use to catch many fish.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.400
Where did you catch most of the fish?

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.400
Well the best one was what we call the flood rank which is the one round the corner.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.400
This one here?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:13.880
The flood rank was, because it was always covered the flood rank whereas the air rank,

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:23.240
the top row as we called it, on a neap tide which is a small tide, it would barely be

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.880
covered, hardly any of it would be covered.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.520
So you'd have no chance unless you were flying fish.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.520
Flying fish?

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.520
Flying fish, I'm only joking.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.640
You've got no chance of catching anything.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:40.440
So you had, what's the one over here called again?

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.440
The flood.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.440
The flood.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.440
The ebb.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:49.000
And there was one called the shrimp which was out and there's like a spit which will

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.960
show up, well it's actually the tide's coming in there.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:59.200
We used to have the shrimp which was only a small rank and it wasn't worth really putting

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.880
putches in it because we caught very few salmon in it.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:07.880
But years ago they used to use it for kite fishing.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:14.880
Which is a much larger and much more interwoven basket.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:24.720
And the front mouth of the basket was between four to five feet wide and it would go down

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:31.840
to a plug on the end of it and it would be tightly woven so it would catch everything,

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:39.640
not just salmon, it would catch small whiting, it would catch flatfish and it would catch

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:40.640
shrimps.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.640
Yeah, was it supposed to catch everything?

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.000
It was meant to catch everything, yeah.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And there would be a funnel on the end of it with a plug in it and then they would take

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:57.480
the funnel off, take the plug out and then tip it into a bucket and then bring it back

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:03.600
up here and then I never did it myself but there was a boiler where they used to...

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.900
What in here?

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:09.040
It was in the fish house just behind where we are now, the original fish house.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:15.540
And so they boil the shrimps and they'd be taken off to the shop in Newport but we never

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.680
did it, we were never really interested in it.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.360
So the boiler was still here when you came?

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.360
The boiler was still here, yeah.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:29.360
But it was something that we never did because it was too labour intensive and we didn't

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.320
have an outlet for the shrimps etc.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:39.320
So rather than using Kite Sweet we'd converted it to butcher fishery but it was very poor,

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.400
very very poor for salmon.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.880
You still called it the shrimp though?

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.400
Yeah, we still call it the shrimp.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:53.400
It was the first to stop because it was labour intensive.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:58.400
If you can imagine having to go and look at it at half past two in the morning, dead at

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:04.720
night in the black darkness, it wasn't exactly the best thing to have to do and when you

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.720
had no fish in it.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.720
Did you have to do that?

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:14.720
When we first started and I soon got fed up with that and so I stopped doing that and

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:21.720
as the price of the putches increased then we decided not to do the ebb and just ended

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.560
up with the flood.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:30.560
How long did you do that before thinking, well this isn't worth it now?

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:37.560
Well, personally I took over the fishery in 1981 and I carried on doing the flood and

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:43.560
the ebb until about 1992.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:50.560
So I suppose, yeah, about 11 years I did the two together and then I gave up the ebb,

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.560
which had 700, 800 baskets.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.560
That's still a lot isn't it?

00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:00.560
Well it sounds a lot but it wasn't an awful lot because you only put them out once at

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.560
the beginning of the season, take them in at the end of the season and that's it.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.560
But checking them every day?

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.560
Every day, twice a day.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:06.560
Twice a day?

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.560
Twice a day but then it's only for, well it was for four months of the year, the original

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:19.560
licence and then towards the end they were trying to reduce it down to just two months

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.720
of the year.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.560
They'd actually cut it to three months of the year.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.560
So it's the environmental agency?

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.560
Yeah, the environmental agency.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:30.560
We're trying to get rid of all commercial fisheries.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.560
Because of their fear about dwindling fish?

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:39.560
Yes, because of the problems with the native species not having an awful lot of fish.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:47.560
Fish returning and also there was other complications with it as well.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:53.560
Interbreeding was a worry as well where I used to catch fish which I didn't really understand

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.560
what they were until I realised that they were farmed fish.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.560
Oh really?

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.560
Because they didn't look like the proper Atlantic salmon.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.560
Got out into the system.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:08.560
And they'd been released somehow, either accidentally or on purpose I would have thought accidentally.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:15.560
And I was catching these funny looking fish which were farmed salmon and the theory was

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:22.560
that they were going to interbreed with the wild fish and if they did that then that would

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:29.560
make the, not a true wild salmon, it would be like a hybrid.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:34.560
And there was all kinds of other things going on.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:41.560
So when your grandfather, father took over, was it withy baskets then?

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.560
No, it was aluminium.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.560
They'd had aluminium for a few years.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:50.560
I think we had some wicker baskets, withy baskets.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:58.560
Because I found a bill for aluminium wire to repair the baskets with.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.560
Oh really?

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:07.560
And my father had requested that a rep had called to talk about new baskets.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:13.560
But I've got a lot of bills and things there, we've got a rich date from 65.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:17.560
Oh gosh, so there's somebody selling the fish as well?

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.560
Yeah, and I believe they're still manufacturing aluminium products now.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:26.560
I'm not sure whether they're still in the full evening I think it was.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:31.560
I've got the receipt for the specimen.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:39.560
I don't think we ever had, we might have done, I'm not 100% sure,

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:45.560
whether we had any made ourselves or whether we just inherited them all.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:50.560
So when your grandfather and grandfather came you had the three rangs here.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:56.560
And presumably they had looked at the books before and thought this is a bit of an earner?

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:05.560
Well again, funnily enough I found workings out that my father did, it must have been about 1964.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:11.560
And I've got the workings out that he jotted down on the back of a piece of paper,

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:19.560
a bit of Beechley Oars Ferries paper, of what he thought the proposal, the hammership would actually make.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:24.560
So something I've never seen actually, I only found it while I was looking through the...

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.560
That's not got chucked out.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.560
No, it's all been kept, yeah.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.560
So did they inherit Wyndham?

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:34.560
Yes, yes, yes, he was part of the furniture.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:45.560
He was 86 when he died and that was about 1983 or 84, no it was probably later, that might have been 86.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.560
I can't remember, I have to look in the graveyard.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:55.560
So whether he was turn of the century then, I'm not sure.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:01.560
But he was here all his life virtually, he went away to war.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.560
Oh did he?

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:10.560
He went to the... I don't know if he was in the First World War or not, but he got posted to certain places.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:17.560
And he did do, I believe he was on the anti-aircraft guns in the war here.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:18.560
Oh yeah?

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.560
But I can find all that out because I'm friends with his grandson, friendly enough.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.560
Oh are you?

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:33.560
Well I employed after Wyndham died, he used to repair the aluminium baskets, I employed his son, John Howells.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.560
Oh, for healing?

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:38.560
So I employed John for, well, until the fishery closed.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.560
Oh gosh, yeah I'd love to get back around to Wyndham.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.560
And then his grandson is a friend of mine.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.560
Do they live around locally?

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.560
They live in Newport.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.560
Oh really?

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.560
So what was your memories of Nick Wyndham?

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:57.560
Did he actually play a role or were your grandparents father and father in kind?

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:03.560
Well he was most, yes it was more, he was part of the furniture.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:16.560
He repaired the baskets which was an important job, but he wasn't, well I suppose he would have been in his mid-60s when we first took it over.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.560
So he would have been reasonably fit and capable in those days.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:26.560
But as time went by we had to employ somebody else because he wasn't up to being by himself here.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:33.560
And he was always helped out by his nephew as well.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:39.560
If John Newton wasn't available there was another man called Andrew Greenholge.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.560
I see Walter's mentioned him this morning.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:52.560
Yeah, well he was a local farmer who was into everything and he was a very cantankerous sort of person.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:57.560
He was a cantankerous, yes, that's the best way of describing him.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:05.560
He called the spade a spade and he was a funny old fellow but he was very useful.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:16.560
He was always the person that I used to employ with his tractor and trailer when we set the fishing out at the beginning of the season and then we took it up again at the end of the season.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.560
He was the man that used to come and sort it all out.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:26.560
You load all the putters in the back and bring the guy on to the foreshore and then they'd have to be fixed into position.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.560
So who would be doing that?

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:35.560
I used to employ people, whoever was available really.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.560
Towards the end of it I couldn't get the locals to do it.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.560
I used to have to get people coming from Chepstone.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:51.560
I used to go to parts of Chepstone where I knew there was a few unemployed people and say, right, I need a couple of men just for a day or two days' work.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:56.560
And they'd all come then and put a bit of cash in their hands.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.560
So how long it took? A couple of days?

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:06.560
It depended, yeah, mostly it would only, depending if it was just the flood, towards the end of it it would only take a day. It would take one tide.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:18.560
But when we used to do this, the flood and the ebb together, it was probably three days because there was a lot of work and this one was messy as anything.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:19.560
Was it? Why?

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.560
Because it's very muddy out there.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.560
And it's on peat rather than on marl.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.560
Yeah.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.560
So you can see, you can actually see tracks out in the peat there now.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:32.560
Yeah.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.560
Where that's where the tractor used to tow.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:41.560
And so every year we used to get stuck, Pansy gets stuck, sorry, Andrew Greenhouse gets stuck.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.560
And there'd be lots of cursing and swearing, Andrew's got stuck again, blah, blah, blah.

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:49.560
And then we'd have to go and get either another tractor or get a winch.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.560
Oh my God, really?

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:55.560
Yeah, that was a real problem.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.560
Did you ever have to re-erect the structure itself, the timbers?

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:05.560
We used to have to, every year we had to maintain the framework, yes.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.560
Every year we would have to replace.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:19.560
Again, that was one of the reasons why I stopped doing this one because in 92 we had a huge gale while the baskets were in place.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:28.560
And it damaged a lot of the framework and it lost a lot of the baskets.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:33.560
I never saw the baskets again, they were gone.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:39.560
So that was one of the other reasons why I decided not to do the ebb.

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:40.560
Should we go in?

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.560
Yeah.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.560
It's a bit cold out here.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.560
Sorry.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:24:11.560
So I've got this image, a photograph of Wyndham with his bike and his beret.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.560
Yeah, that's a good picture, if you've got it.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.560
I don't know whether I got one of those.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:22.560
Yeah, before they used to use the Land Rover, they used to do it with a push bike.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.560
Did they? What do you mean they did it with a push bike?

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:29.560
Well, they had a butcher's bike with a pannier on it.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.560
Yes.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.560
I don't think I've got that picture actually.

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:39.560
So you'd have a pannier on the front and a pannier on the back.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.560
Yeah.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:49.560
And he'd have to put the fish on the bike and then ride it down to the flood.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.560
Yeah.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:56.560
And then wheel it back with the fish on the bike.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:57.560
Really?

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.560
Yeah. And if there was a lot of fish, he'd have to make several trips.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.560
Wow, yes he would.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.560
Yeah.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:11.560
So this place here, Adrian, this is the fishery. What did it look like when it was a fishery?

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.560
Oh, the old fish house.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.560
Yeah, this is the fish house?

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:23.560
This is the old fish house. That's a good question. That's what it looked like.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.560
Oh wow, this is here.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.560
Yeah.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.560
So what am I looking at then?

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:32.560
Well, that's where we were sat, just there when we sat outside.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.560
Oh my goodness.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.560
It was just demolished.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:35.560
Really?

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.560
The only thing I kept was the weather vane which was on the other place, the other side.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.560
Wow. And that's one of the salmon?

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:43.560
That's fresh, yeah.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.560
Goodness. Quite a big salmon.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:47.560
Yeah, there's a couple there.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.560
Wow, crikey.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:54.560
And there's the stick. There we are, you can see the stick there.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:58.560
Now what was this for? Oh, the little thing on that side. It's a little gaff really, isn't it?

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:05.560
Yeah, it wasn't. As I say, it was like a fork, just a two-pronged fork on the end of it.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:12.560
That's such a great photograph. Isn't it? Wow, I used to really want a car like that.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.560
That's a Renault 4.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.560
Yeah.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:21.560
Well, as time went by, Land Rovers became expensive.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:29.560
So I discovered that Renault 4s were much cheaper and did the job just as well, if not better.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.560
Would you bring that down onto the foreshore?

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I used to drive it down.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.560
What, with the trailer?

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:43.560
No, no, no, no, just in the back. I used to fold the seats down in the back, put the trays in the back of the vehicle and away you go.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.560
What, to collect the salmon?

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.560
Yeah, yeah.

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.560
Oh my God. Really?

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.560
So then you would bring them back up here, would you?

00:26:51.560 --> 00:27:06.560
Yeah, and then they'd go into the fish house in there. In there there'd be a big fridge and a freezer making ice and what we call a bosh, which is like a big sink.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:15.560
And we chuck the fish in the bosh, wash them all off, put them in the fridge, put ice over them and then wait until we've got enough to take to market.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.560
So market would be?

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:21.560
Well, in the early days it used to go to Billingsgate.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.560
Yeah.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:31.560
But that was very early days because the amount of fish that we used to catch grew less and less and less.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:38.560
So in the early days it used to go up to, I used to deal with a company called Bennets in Billingsgate.

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:42.560
But when my father took it over he used to deal with a different company.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.560
Well I guess it probably became Bennets.

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:54.560
And that was established in 1840 apparently and this was H. Barber and Sons.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.560
So you would take them to Newport Station?

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:57.560
Yes.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.560
And then would there be a special train?

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:11.560
Yeah, it was the post train would take it in the mornings. So it would take it, you'd go up, take it, leave it at the station and then they'd stick it on the post train.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:21.560
And then the Billingsgate would send a lorry and they would collect salmon from all over the country, not just from us.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:30.560
It would be coming in from Scotland and North Wales and the East Coast of England, anywhere where they'd been catching salmon.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.560
Could see the other ranks along here as well?

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:39.560
Well possibly. Yeah I suppose if they had enough fish, yes.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:45.560
And so then that would go up to Billingsgate Market.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.560
So that is?

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.560
Well that one's in 1971.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:54.560
And this is a receipt to you for how many fish you had?

00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:03.560
Yes. So there was one box of five fish.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:12.560
67 pounds. Wow. I mean, carriage delivery in toll.

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.560
Yeah, that's...

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:24.560
48 pounds. Wow. Gosh. What a lovely document.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:33.560
Yeah, well there's a better day there. There's some...

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.560
Got so much rubbish here.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.560
It's not rubbish though, is it?

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.560
I don't know why it keeps it all...

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:40.560
It's nice stuff, isn't it?

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.560
Oh, it's just lovely.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.560
So there's two boxes of fish there.

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:50.560
22 fish. So this would be the 28th of the 5th, 71.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:57.560
So that was a good season. They had 154 pounds for those in 1971.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.560
I wonder how many days' work that represented?

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:05.560
That was probably a couple of tides, two or three tides I guess, at least.

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.560
So two tides a day, so you're doing that twice a day?

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.560
Yes. Yeah.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.560
So it's quite hard work.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:20.560
Well, it wasn't hard work as such because it was only for an hour or so.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:25.560
Because once the tide... you'd have to wait for the tide to go out.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:30.560
So as the tide went out, you could follow the water down and see if you got any fish.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:35.560
Or you could just wait for the tide to go out and then just go down and do it in one quick...

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:41.560
which is what we would do in sort of the night time. We'd just go down when the tide was out.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.560
Did you have lights?

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.560
Yeah, we used to have big halogen lamps.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:49.560
Do you ever get caught out by the tide?

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.560
Well, I lost a few cars.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.560
Have you? Why?

00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:01.560
Well, it was more looking for baskets. When the baskets used to get washed out,

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.560
you'd get a bit of wind and tide.

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:08.560
And it would knock the baskets out at the top of the fishing.

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:12.560
And I know where they were. They'd go up into the sand. You could see the sand.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:17.560
I know where they were. So being lazy, I wouldn't walk to go and get them.

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:21.560
I'd take a shovel and... because you'd have to dig it out, basically.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:27.560
I took the car up there to get so far and then I'd walk for the rest of it.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.560
Not the Renault?

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.560
Yes. Lost the Renault 4 once, yes.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.560
What happened?

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:38.560
Well, the wheels got stuck in the mud and I couldn't get it out.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.560
Did you get the basket out?

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:41.560
Probably, yes.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.560
And then you had to walk back with it?

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.560
Yeah, well, it's not heavy. It's very light.

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:53.560
But there might have been half a dozen, you see. So I would have needed the car then to get them.

00:31:53.560 --> 00:32:00.560
So the fish house, it looks really tall in the photograph. Why was it so tall?

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.560
Did you have rooms upstairs?

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:07.560
No, there was no rooms upstairs, but it used to have a system in it where you had...

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:12.560
you can't see it on this very well, but there's a grill. Can you see the grill?

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:13.560
Yeah.

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:22.560
You'd have a grill both ends. So it was designed to allow the wind to blow through so you could open the grills so it would keep it cool in there.

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.560
Okay, okay. Yeah.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:29.560
But prior to this, there was a house attached to this as well.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.560
Yeah.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:36.560
Before this part of it here was older than this part here.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.560
Yeah. And what was that part then?

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:48.560
Well, this was a part of the original house because there wasn't an original house here which was pulled down in the 40s.

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.560
Oh, yeah. Do you know much about that?

00:32:50.560 --> 00:33:02.560
No, not really. It was just where the people used to stay, I suppose, when it was summertime. I don't know much about it at all, to be honest.

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:07.560
So would Wyndham stay in the fish house during the season?

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:16.560
He wouldn't live there. No, he lived down South Marsh Lane. He would come... well, he used to cycle on his bike to get to the fishing.

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:20.560
And then in latter years, he had a little moped.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.560
Oh, really? Yeah.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:30.560
Yeah, the show used to provide him. So he could come and do his bits and pieces, repair the baskets.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.560
So would you have a fire somewhere to boil a cup of tea?

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:39.560
Well, there's probably a photograph of that somewhere. I don't know. I've gotten loads of photographs.

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:48.560
But he would have his sort of living area in the daytime. He had like a day bed where he could have a snooze.

00:33:48.560 --> 00:34:02.560
And then he'd have a coke fire, which all the schools had them at the turn of the century, these pot stoves.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:07.560
And he had one of those, which used to keep himself warm. He had asbestos fingers.

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:13.560
He used to be able to lift the top of the coke fire off with his fingers. I don't know how.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:23.560
And then he'd be able to fill it up with coke, not cold coke, which is what they used at the steelworks.

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.560
Oh, really?

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:32.560
He used to get out very hot, red hot sometimes. But somewhere I've got more photographs.

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:40.560
And there is one of him in the other, this building here is the buildings over there.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.560
And what was that building for?

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:46.560
That was for repairing the baskets. That's where they used to do the basket making and repairing.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.560
Is that where they were also stored in the winter?

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:54.560
The baskets, no, they were stored outside. They were just left outside in racks.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:58.560
So this model here, that's in Newport Museum, isn't it?

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:02.560
It could be. My brother's got that particular one, in fact.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.560
Oh, really?

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:07.560
But I believe he did present one to the museum.

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.560
Yeah, I've seen it. It's in the stalls.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:10.560
Oh, is it? Okay.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.560
Yeah, it's in the stalls.

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:12.560
Yes.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:20.560
So I imagine, or maybe not, that when your father and grandfather arrived,

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:25.560
that they looked to Wyndham's for his knowledge of operating a rack?

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.560
Oh, yeah, I would think so, yes.

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:28.560
Yeah.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.560
But it wasn't rocket science, but we tried different things.

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:36.560
I tried putting baskets in the wrong way round and doing all different things like that, experimenting.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:40.560
But none of it worked. It was always the way that it always had been.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:45.560
And so that was the way we always went back to.

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.560
Did you ever sell to local people?

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:53.560
Yeah, anybody in a farm that used to turn up or anybody who wanted it, restaurants, et cetera.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:54.560
Oh, yeah.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:59.560
People in Chepstow, because I lived in Chepstow, used to take it to people in there.

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:06.560
And so, yeah, as the price plummeted because of the farm salmon,

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:11.560
we had to find other better ways of selling it.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:17.560
So rather than sending it to London, we sold it to the local hostels, hotels, restaurants.

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:21.560
So we used to sell it to us and Chepstow.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.560
Did you ever weigh each individual salmon?

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.560
I always weighed it, yeah.

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.560
Do you know what your heaviest one was?

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.560
33 and a half.

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:30.560
Wow.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.560
I have a picture of it somewhere, but wow, I've got no idea.

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.560
Really? That's a big one.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.560
Yeah, that was the biggest one I ever had.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:40.560
There was talk of bigger ones before I took over here.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.560
Was there a fishing record here?

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.560
We had to keep records by law.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:48.560
We had to keep a record of every fish caught.

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:54.560
So I haven't got any again that I've got somewhere.

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:56.560
This is all I could find.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.560
I've got all the records of all the years.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:02.560
And it tells you how many fish were caught on every day.

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:03.560
My God.

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:05.560
But it wasn't very good reading, I'm afraid.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:10.560
Was it handwritten in the early days?

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.560
I don't know.

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:17.560
We used to do it on like a photocopied form.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:23.560
But then towards the end we used to do it on a specially carbonated paper

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:26.560
that the environment agency used to provide.

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:31.560
So they would give me a book each season.

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:35.560
And then I would fill out every day.

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:44.560
But as the years went by, as we didn't fish as much, etc., it was pretty dismal.

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.560
And this was very reliant on the weather here.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:52.560
This particular fishery was very reliant because of where we are.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:57.560
Because it's so far from one side to the other, seven miles.

00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:02.560
If the wind was in the wrong direction, it would blow the freshwater stream,

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.560
which is what the fish would be looking for.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:08.560
It would blow it out to sea and we wouldn't catch anything.

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:13.560
So we were always looking for a nice southwest wind or a southerly wind.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:17.560
Always waiting to see what happens.

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.560
Is it a bit like the lambing season?

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.560
Pretty exhausting, you have to be up all hours.

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:25.560
Oh yeah, it was miserable times.

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:29.560
Because it wasn't like every day was the same day.

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:33.560
Every day was an hour's difference or more.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:37.560
So if it was midnight one night, then it would be one o'clock the next night.

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:41.560
And then the next night it might be quarter past two.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:46.560
Because the difference in the tides, they don't actually follow that it's an hour.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.560
Because it's a neap tide, a neap tide goes out slower.

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.560
So it's more like an hour and a half.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.560
And then if it's a spring tide, it's less.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.560
So it's less than an hour.

00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:01.560
So it's a little bit complicated, but it's never the same time.

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.560
Did you ever feel, or your father and grandmother,

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:09.560
feel that we're part of this dying tradition?

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:11.560
Oh definitely, yeah, towards the end.

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:19.560
Because I fought it very hard when they tried to extinguish the fishery.

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:23.560
Because I wanted to keep it as a heritage thing.

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:30.560
So I got a, well this is part of the package I put together.

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:34.560
To try and maintain the heritage of it all.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:37.560
And that's one of the reasons why I carried on doing it.

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:44.560
Because I thought it was something unique to the Wales coastline.

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.560
Yeah, so did you get nowhere with that?

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:50.560
Well in the end I was compensated, not an awful lot of money,

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:55.560
but they compensated me, I don't know, I can't really remember.

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.560
What, the environment agency?

00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:58.560
The environment agency, yeah.

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:04.560
Yeah, well I was paid by the, by the Wye and...

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.560
Pusk.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:09.560
Wye Foundation, the Nask Foundation, the Wye and Nask Foundation.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.560
Yeah.

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:15.560
Not to fish, they paid me to stop fishing for a few years.

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:18.560
And then when it came to it, after that period stopped,

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:23.560
the environment agency said, right, we want you to stop altogether.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:27.560
We'll either pay for you not to fish permanently,

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:32.560
or we'll pass an act of parliament and we'll get you out that way.

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:35.560
And they were trying to reduce the amount of time,

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:37.560
from three months to two months,

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:41.560
and so basically I knew I was on a hide and do nothing,

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.560
you can't compete against the environment agency,

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.560
unlike Nigel Maud, who's still competing with them.

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:50.560
Yeah, I know, he's got some energy there, hasn't he?

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:54.560
He has, in fact that's probably about him, that article there.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.560
When did it stop then Adrian?

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:01.560
Here, the last time I was fishing was 1999.

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:02.560
That's quite a long time though.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.560
Twenty years.

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:04.560
Yeah.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.560
Was your father still alive then when you stopped?

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:09.560
No, no.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:15.560
No, no, that one's about, well that is probably to do with Nigel Maud,

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:16.560
somewhere along the way.

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.560
Did you enjoy it though?

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.560
Oh it was great, yeah, it was a real talking point.

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:24.560
It was unusual, you know, it was unique.

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:27.560
I had other jobs, not proper jobs,

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:30.560
because I could never have a proper job.

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:35.560
I always had salesman jobs, I worked for Rank Xerox for a bit,

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:38.560
trying to sell their photocopies, that was a disaster.

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.560
God, everyone's worked for Rank Xerox.

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:44.560
Yeah, lots of people work for them.

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:47.560
And then I worked for a company called Welsh Glass,

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:52.560
and I sold replacement windows, which I was quite successful at.

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.560
I worked for them for fifteen years.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.560
Oh really?

00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:00.560
But when this finished, were you sad, or just accepted it?

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:07.560
Well, yeah, I was sad, but I suppose I had to accept the fact that I wasn't catching the fish.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:12.560
I wasn't getting any proper money out of it, I wasn't earning anything from it.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:15.560
I didn't tell the advice, I'd better keep quiet really.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:20.560
You can scrub that all out, nobody need know that.

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:24.560
No, but I was doing it because I enjoyed doing it.

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:30.560
I wasn't doing it to make money, really, because I wasn't making any real money.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:36.560
So, yeah, it was different. Very unusual.

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:40.560
Did you ever see Wyndham repairing the baskets and stuff like that?

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:43.560
Only the aluminium ones, yeah, not the wooden ones,

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:46.560
because that was before my time.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:55.560
Wyndham used to help him at one point, and then his son John used to do them after Wyndham died.

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.560
So was there a skill to it?

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:05.560
I wouldn't say it was a great skill, but you had to know how the basket worked,

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:11.560
you needed to know how to make the bends in the pieces of aluminium wire,

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:18.560
but it wasn't a very skillful job, but to have made one out of withy, that was a skill.

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:25.560
The Morgan boys, as you probably know, they make them still. That is a skill.

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.560
Yeah, and they look lovely too, don't they?

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:28.560
Yes.

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:33.560
Did you ever find anything in your baskets that wasn't a salmon, or wasn't a fish for something unusual?

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:37.560
I always dreaded a body, but I never got one.

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:43.560
Never got one, luckily. Because that was something my father used to do.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:51.560
Because we always had boats on the river, he would be the one that they turned to go and find a body

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:53.560
if somebody jumped off one of the bridges.

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.560
Oh God, really?

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:58.560
So he would be the person that would have to go and recover the body.

00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.560
Oh gosh.

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:06.560
Yeah, before the days of the lifeboats and the sarah and whatever.

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.560
Were they always boatmen then, your family?

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:15.560
Well, my grandfather, as I say, was an architect. He had nothing to do with it. I don't even think he could swim, to be honest.

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:16.560
Wow.

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:24.560
But my father was about boats all his life, yes, because he had the ferry in his blood.

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.560
Did you have a boat down here?

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:30.560
He didn't, I did. I used to have boats here.

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:36.560
He used to keep his boats in Chepstow, either in the Wye or in Chepstow Pill.

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:41.560
And then we had boats in Cornwall and places, West Wales.

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.560
Did you ever go out to Denny Island?

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.560
I went there once.

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:47.560
How did you get there?

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:51.560
I got there in a boat, a Dory, many years ago.

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:54.560
I met somebody recently who walked there with cattle.

00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:59.560
Well, I don't know if they can do that. I think that might be a bit of a...

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:05.560
He is certain they spent several hours there between tides.

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:06.560
Oh, yeah, OK.

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:07.560
Do you think it's impossible?

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:12.560
I don't know whether it's impossible, but I would say it's very, very, very tricky.

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:18.560
It's not a lot of grass on it either. There's not much there.

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:21.560
What is there? I mean, why do you...

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:26.560
Why did you go there?

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:29.560
We went to have a look at it. Just went out to somewhere to go,

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.560
because there's very few places to go in a boat from here.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:38.560
So we went out to the Denny. It's about, oh, it's probably six miles from here.

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:41.560
Yeah, it's an all-way out, isn't it?

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:48.560
And there wasn't much there. It was mostly bird nests.

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:51.560
But we would have gone there probably July, August,

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:55.560
so the birds would have probably finished nesting by that time.

00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:59.560
But I can't remember. It was a long time ago.

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:01.560
But it wasn't a lot of grass on it.

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:05.560
He swears that they took the cows out there to graze.

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:12.560
You were telling me about the farm next door that used to...

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.560
Was it a hospital or something?

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:26.560
Well, no, it was... I know of people in the area whose parents were born there.

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:32.560
The green algaes, the witherses, the waterses, hazels.

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:35.560
Hazels took it over. I'm not sure when.

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:41.560
But they mentioned to me that if you were going to have a baby,

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:45.560
it must have been somebody who knew what they were doing.

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:47.560
Like a midwife, maybe?

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:53.560
Before midwives, this is 100 years ago, 90-odd years ago.

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:58.560
Before the NHS, you'd have somebody who knew what they were doing,

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.560
not a doctor or whatever.

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:09.560
And the old farmhouse used to be a place where they would come to have their children.

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.560
That's so interesting.

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:14.560
Well, the only thing I can suggest is that you talk to Sue Waters,

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:17.560
because she would probably know better than me about it.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:21.560
But I know there's a lady called Bunty Withers who lives in Lydney,

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:27.560
who she always talks about the farm and about how she was born there, etc.

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:31.560
Really? Bunty Withers? What a fantastic name.

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:33.560
Yeah, well, she's now Bunty Stickler.

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:37.560
Yeah? And she was born out here?

00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:40.560
She was born, she says, in the farm.

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:41.560
Really?

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:44.560
But it was a bit different to what it is now, you see.

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:51.560
It's a much smaller building, and it was part of the Priory.

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:53.560
Yes, of course, yeah.

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:57.560
But who else? Again, you need to talk to the Waterses.

00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:58.560
Oh, yes.

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:01.560
They would know much more about it than me.

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:06.560
Martin would know more about it than me, but he probably wouldn't know that much about it.

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:08.560
Martin Hayeswell is the guy that owns it now.

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.560
Well, yeah, somebody should actually go and speak to him.

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:13.560
Yeah, well, if you can get him. He's not there very often.

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.560
Isn't he? No.

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:20.560
Do you ever have people passing by and saying, oh, I used to fish there?

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:22.560
All the time.

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:25.560
Really? Yeah?

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:29.560
I get people come over, you used to come down, you were the boy, blah, blah, blah.

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:30.560
Oh, really?

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:32.560
Yeah.

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:39.560
But do you ever think, when you're here in the winter and you have a high tide, does it ever intimidate you?

00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:44.560
Because it must be quite something to see.

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:52.560
Well, the house has been here for 27 years, and it's pretty well built.

00:48:52.560 --> 00:49:00.560
When I built it, I built it not with my own hands, but I'd specified it all, designed it all, and said I want this, that and the other.

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:07.560
And so we haven't done too badly. It hasn't flooded or anything like that because it's higher.

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:16.560
But we do get a lot of breaking spray coming over the top of the wall when it's windy, when it's very windy.

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.560
That must be daunting.

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:21.560
It is if you stood in the window upstairs.

00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:26.560
I can show you some video footage of it if you like.

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:28.560
Well, I actually came across some on YouTube.

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.560
Yes, probably stuff I took then.

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:32.560
Oh, maybe. And it was coming through the gates there?

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:34.560
Yeah, that's stuff I've posted on YouTube.

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:36.560
Oh, right. Oh, crap.

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:42.560
So the fact that at high tide, down there, it's below sea level, that doesn't intimidate you?

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:49.560
No, no, not at all. No, we're way above the high tide line here, so we've got no problem.

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:52.560
The other building down there, that floods occasionally.

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:53.560
The cafe?

00:49:53.560 --> 00:50:02.560
No, the other house where they used to repair the baskets. That used to flood.

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:08.560
But we've had a new ramp put in so it doesn't flood as often as it used to.

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:12.560
Is there anything else you'd like to ask, Adrian, that I haven't asked you about?

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:19.560
Not really. I can't think, really.

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:22.560
Could I take some copies of these photographs?

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:23.560
Of course you can.

00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:27.560
Is that okay? You'll be credited with everything, of course.

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:36.560
Well, I keep meaning to, too lazy to do it, to scan it all and then post it on, because my website, I've got goldcliff.net.

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:37.560
Have you?

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:50.560
Yes, www.goldcliff.net, which I never ever get around to doing. I've had it for 20 years and I kept meaning to do it and I never do it.

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:54.560
That's great. It takes a long time to scan loads of stuff like this.

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:55.560
Yeah.

00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:56.560
Doesn't it?

00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:04.560
Yes. I've lost all kinds of pictures, but as you say, things like that one there, that's a great picture.

00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:06.560
And you reckon that's the 1920s?

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:11.560
It says 1929, whoever wrote it on there.

00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:12.560
And it's here?

00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:14.560
This is the flood, yes.

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:19.560
And all the others, do you reckon, are from here?

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:25.560
Well, not all of them. Some of them are, some of them aren't. Most of these are.

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:28.560
I mean, this is fantastic, isn't it, this?

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:29.560
Yeah.

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:36.560
Wow.

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:42.560
That's probably quite big. I might have to get my big scanner out. Is that okay?

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:43.560
If you want to, yeah.

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:44.560
Is that okay?

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:45.560
If you want.

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:47.560
I just don't want to take too much of your time.

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:48.560
No, it's all right.

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:53.560
That means I have to get the whole caboodle out.

00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:04.560
I mean, this is a great little thing for little photos.

00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:06.560
Yeah.

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:16.560
And I've seen this one, I've seen this. That's a good new thing to see in that one.

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:18.560
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:23.560
Because somebody came along and interviewed Wyndham, didn't they?

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:30.560
Yeah, it was John Williams Davis. I remember his name after I spoke to you last.

00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:31.560
And who's he?

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:37.560
He worked for the museum in Cardiff, the...

00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:39.560
St. Faggots?

00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:40.560
St. Faggots, I said.

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:41.560
Oh, right.

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.560
That'd be before your time, no agent?

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:52.560
No, no, I knew John Williams Davis. I don't know if he's still alive or not, but he must be in his early...

00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:54.560
be in his late 70s, I would guess.

00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:58.560
Yeah. Did he interview your father?

00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:03.560
No, he interviewed Wyndham. He used to sit there and talk to Wyndham for hours on end.

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:13.560
Wyndham's sister's still alive, isn't she?

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:14.560
Er...

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:15.560
Or his daughter?

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:21.560
His daughter is Monica. She still lives in the family home down in Porton.

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:24.560
Sorry, not Porton, Saltmarsh, Saltmarsh Lane.

00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:27.560
She's still down in Saltmarsh Lane, yeah.

00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:33.560
Are you sure this is OK, Adrian?

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:34.560
Yeah, yeah.

00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:36.560
I'm not going to take up too much of your time.

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.560
Er, it's all OK.

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:52.560
Well, it's nice that somebody's doing something with it, but er...

00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:55.560
as I say, I keep meaning to have a go at myself, but...

00:53:56.560 --> 00:54:00.560
all these things, you know, there's so much of my family I should be doing,

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:02.560
and it doesn't happen, you know.

00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:03.560
Yeah.

00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:06.560
And then I realised I'd spent my life interviewing people.

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:11.560
I hadn't interviewed my mum. My mum and my parents came over from Ireland in their 50s...

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:12.560
Oh, yeah.

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:13.560
...for work and er...

00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:15.560
Why do you think you're crying so much?

00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:16.560
LAUGHTER

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:25.560
Somewhere I've got some other ones that I can't find.

00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:40.560
I'm just glad to see you haven't chucked any of it out.

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:42.560
I probably have somewhere.

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:43.560
LAUGHTER

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:47.560
I don't know, I got a lot of it.

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:51.560
I kept a lot of it because it is, as you say, it's heritage, isn't it?

00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:53.560
It really is heritage.

00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:54.560
Yeah.

00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.560
It's a shame to lose it.

00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.560
Oh, there we are.

00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:04.560
I've got the names of the people.

00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:06.560
Oh, my goodness!

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:09.560
Erm, so that's Dave Gale.

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:17.560
That's Lou Whitaker, George Whitaker, Unknown Unknown and Edmund Jones.

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:22.560
Now, this chap here, he appears in one of the Newport photographs.

00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:27.560
Well, he looks like Jerry Waters, but erm...

00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:28.560
LAUGHTER

00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:31.560
I don't know, he's meant to be George...

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:34.560
Oh, it's George Whitaker then, that is. Yeah, yeah, if it's George Whitaker.

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:37.560
Yeah, he's the man that...

00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:40.560
Er, a Windham Howells was an apprentice to...

00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:41.560
Oh, really?

00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:44.560
He would have taught Windham how to make the baskets.

00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:45.560
Oh!

00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:48.560
What do you know about him?

00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:50.560
George Whitaker? Not much.

00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:57.560
He worked here again for most of his adult life, making the baskets and doing the fishing.

00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:59.560
I wonder if he was from Goldcliff.

00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:02.560
Yeah, yeah, he was a Goldcliff man.

00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:06.560
His son, Stan Whitaker, lived here till about 20-odd years ago.

00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:07.560
Yeah.

00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:09.560
I would guess Stan's dead now as well.

00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:11.560
Gosh, I haven't come across the name Whitaker here.

00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:13.560
Yes, yeah.
