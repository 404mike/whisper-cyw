Dyna o'r ddryd?

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.320
Ie, ydwch yn ymwneud yn y ddryd.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.320
Roeddwn i'n ogystal â phamlu ar ôl.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.320
Ie, a beth o bach chi wedi oedd?

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:50.320
I had five, and when the little ones started to go to school then I went to look for a job.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:59.320
And that's where we went me and my friends to go part time while the kids were in school.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.320
So we went to Fish and Price first for a while.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.320
So you were living now in Lichau this time?

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.320
No, Gosainan.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.320
Gosainan.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.320
Oh sorry no, I was living in Lichau then, I remember now.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.320
Yeah, cos I was living in Lichau.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:24.320
The house that we got was, my husband was born next door, so he hasn't moved far, so next door we were.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.320
And his mother and father was living there.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.320
But before we had that house, we lived with his mother and father before they had the council house.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.320
Right, so the children, how old was your youngest child when you went then back to work?

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.320
Well they were in school I know.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.320
Cos I didn't like to leave him on his own too young.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:54.320
I should imagine he would have been a sixth nine, something like that.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.320
What date was that, do you remember?

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.320
No I can't remember that date.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.320
When was your son born?

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.320
1966.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.320
So it would be about...

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.320
1973.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.320
In the early 70s then that you went then?

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:16.320
Yes, cos I remembered after, it was 1973 that we were made redundant.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:22.320
So that's what I remembered when I looked it up, it was 1973.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.320
So your first job then in the factory was in Fisher and Price?

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.320
Fisher and Price, yes.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.320
And where was that, where was the factory?

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:35.320
Well next door to Mettoys, so just about next door to Mettoys it was.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.320
That's Forest Park?

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.320
Yes, yes, Forest Park.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.320
How did you get to work there then?

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.320
By bus.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:48.320
Sometimes if we might have a lift, but very rare, but we had to go for a bus then.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.320
It was a service bus, not a works bus?

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.320
Oh no, a service bus, another works bus then.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:58.320
So you went, you decided, two or three of you together decided to go?

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:05.320
Well two of us, yes, well three of us, but one didn't stay, she didn't like it, she only stayed one day.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.320
She didn't like it, so my other friend and I stayed then for a while, but she left as well.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.320
I don't think she went to Mettoys, I'm not sure.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.320
The three of you went up together, did you have an interview?

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.320
Yes, we had an interview, yes.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:34.320
So we had that, but it was part time it was, at 9.00 until 3.00, because we can come home for the time the children come home from school, see.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:44.320
So that was a nice time, but of course when we went over to Mettoys we had to go full time, which was a problem, but we did manage it then.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:55.320
Well, because the oldest girl, she was there to watch them coming home from school and she was there to like a moment of work, so they were all right.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:05.320
Otherwise I would have to leave there if it was full time, because I was puzzling to stay really, because I was thinking of the kids there.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:14.320
But my daughter and my son as well, they said they'd watch them, so that's the day then they went full time then.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.320
So you were working part time, were there lots of others working part time?

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.320
Oh yes, a lot of us were part time, yes.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.320
What did Fisher Price actually produce?

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:33.320
Wooden toys, the things like that, you know, well they're still selling them now, and they were good toys, the Fisher Price was, very good toys.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:38.320
What were you doing there? Do you remember the exact job you were doing?

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:55.320
Well we were on the line, we were, see, and I can remember one thing we were doing, as the people who will remember, you know the dogs that you pull, we were doing them, we were, and I can't remember the other ones, we were doing a lot of them.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:00.320
So do you remember what you were doing to this dog? Were there different parts?

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:10.320
Oh yes, different parts, everybody was doing their different parts here. I'm not sure what I will remember. I think I was putting the wheels on, I'm not sure.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.320
It's on the line then?

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:22.320
It goes up to the line, see, until they come to the end, and then there's a supervisor then to see that there's no reject, and nothing like that's on it as well.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.320
So did you have any training at all?

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.320
No, he didn't have no training.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.320
Just told what to do?

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.320
Just told what to do and carry on.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:35.320
Do you remember your first day there? What sort of impression did that do on you?

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:45.320
We were a bit nervous, because the foreman that we called was there, I can't remember his name. We were all afraid of him.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:56.320
Because if the machine happened to break, we were afraid to tell him, because he didn't like the machines to be broken, so we were calling the boys then to come and mend it for us.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:04.320
So that's what we went to do then. He's all right to work with, but don't get the machines broken. He doesn't like that at all.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.320
Is that because he had to produce so much?

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.320
That's what I tried, as well, see.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.320
So he produced so much work, time and motion, time and body, is it?

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.320
Yes, yes.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.320
Do you remember the first day at all, or you don't remember that?

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.320
No, not really.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:26.320
How many other girls would have been working then on the line in the room, in the factory? Was it very big?

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:37.320
No, the Pritchard Price wasn't that big, not as big as Mettoy's. It was very small. Well, not small, and it wasn't big. But Mettoy's was the biggest, well, it was.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.320
How many women have been working on the line? Can you give us some idea?

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.320
10 or 20?

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:55.320
No, it won't be 10 or 20. It could be 10, but it won't be 20. Say about 10. 10 of us would be less, might.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.320
Did you have to wear anything special to that?

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:03.320
No, no, I didn't have to wear anything special. Just ordinary clothes.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.320
Did you wear overall at all?

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:10.320
Not unless you put your own on, like, if you had your own, yes. But otherwise, no.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:17.320
So did they make that whole dog, or all the toy in the factory from beginning to end?

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:25.320
Oh, yes, from the beginning to the line up to the end, then, see. But they would do it as well, but I can't remember what others were doing.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:30.320
So they must have got the parts themselves?

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.320
Oh, yes, they got the parts, and then we got to send them them, so.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.320
They didn't make the parts in the factory?

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.320
No, no, we just got to put them together, like, see.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.320
And then, was there a packing department as well?

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:53.320
Oh, yes, a packing there as well, at the end as well, see, after the supervisor or the one that's got that seat, or that is in good order, you know what I mean.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:12:00.320
It's in good nick, then. There's nothing wrong with it, and then the packers, the packing map, then, see.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.320
Right, because today, toys have to pass, you know, standard, don't they?

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.320
Yeah, yeah.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.320
Was that the case then?

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.320
Oh, yes, they had to do that as well, yeah. They had to do that as well.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.320
Right, so they were quite ffasibled with what you produced?

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.320
Oh, yes, yes. Oh, yes.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.320
And so some of them?

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.320
Because any rejects, then, they put it in another box, then.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.320
Do you remember how much you were earning at all?

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:27.320
No, I can't remember how much I was earning. No, it was very small.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:34.320
So why did you decide to go into a factory rather than to a shop to work at that time?

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:42.320
I don't know, we just suggested to go to a shop, that's what they wanted to come, because I thought you would be no good in the shop.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.320
There was lots of factories at that time, wasn't there?

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:58.320
Yes, it was a lot of factories. Well, yes, it was a loads down in, what was it, there was a sewing factory down there as well, and, oh, there was a few factories down there, really.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.320
So you could have had a choice?

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.320
Oh, yes, I could have had a choice, yes, there was loads down there.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:09.320
And what was the attitude towards, you know, women who worked in factories, were they all right to you?

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:17.320
Oh, yes, they were good, yes, we all enjoyed ourselves there and had fun as well. Well, we had a lot of fun there, it was.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:27.320
When you were working then on the, when you had your wages, what did you spend your wages on? Was that something extra in the house, or was it the main?

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:34.320
Well, it was a bit extra to, well, towards, because my husband wasn't working then.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.320
Ah, right.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.320
He wasn't working then.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.320
So it was less, yes.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.320
So it was less, yes.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:50.320
Yes, because it was less towards the children and food as well, see, because, I mean, it wasn't much, but it was something.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:14:00.320
Otherwise, if he was working, I'd had good wages, I wouldn't have bothered to go to work, but he wasn't working at the time then.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.320
What was your husband's job?

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:10.320
Well, before he went bad, he was on the Ashman in the council, driving the Ash lorries, he was then.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:21.320
And then he went to the steelworks in Pond de Dyles, Morgan and Rees, and then for a while, when he got better, yes.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.320
So when he was ill, you know, that's when you went to work?

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.320
He went to work, yes, yes, that's when I went to work then.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.320
So it was important then?

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:33.320
Oh yes, it was important, because you had five children then to bring up, then see.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:37.320
So that's why I went out to work.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.320
So when you were working, did you join the union at all?

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:51.320
Yes, we did join the union, yes, we did join, we had to join it then in those days in the factories, yes, we did join then.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:56.320
Was there some part of the wage that was taken out for the union membership?

00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:05.320
Oh yes, we were taking some of that out as well, and the stamps as well, but only half a stamp we were paying, because it was only part time.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:17.320
We could have paid the full, but because we weren't earning that much, we went off of it then, so it was half a stamp we were paying then at that time.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.320
Did you have to clock in?

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.320
Oh yes, we had to clock in, yes.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.320
And clock out?

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.320
And clock out, yes.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:28.320
So when you clocked out, did you stop working straight away, or did you finish a job when you were?

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:40.320
Oh no, well we had to finish a job first, and we had to get them out, they gave us a target to get out, and we had to do that target, otherwise you wouldn't have your bonus sort of thing, you know.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:46.320
So we had to do that before we could clock out anyhow, but we did manage it anyhow.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.320
So it was so much a day exactly?

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:54.320
Oh yes, we had to get our target out, they'd tell us how many we were supposed to get out, we got to try and get that out.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.320
Did you remember how much that was?

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.320
No, I couldn't.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.320
No.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.320
And then the bonus was on top of your wage, was it?

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:06.320
Yes, if we had the bonus we'd go on top of our wage then, see, to build it up a bit then, yes.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.320
And when were you paid?

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.320
On a Friday, we paid da da da.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.320
In cash?

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.320
Oh yes, yes, we were preferred in cash.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:20.320
And do you ever go to the office, or how were you paid?

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.320
No, they bring it out, they bring it around.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:30.320
I don't know if the supervisors, they bring them around for you, in their packets ready for you.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.320
Were you given pay rises, you know? Do you remember if the money went up at all?

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:43.320
No, I don't think, it was only that the bonus was making it more in the way.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.320
If you can get the bonus out.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:52.320
How many years did you work in Fisher Price before moving to Metoey?

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.320
I don't know.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.320
Were you talking about four, five, six years or more?

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.320
No, it couldn't have been that. Say three years.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:06.320
It was three years, I can't remember when they finished there.

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.320
So did you have holidays from the work?

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.320
No, I don't think we ever bothered with holidays.

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.320
Is that because you were part-time perhaps?

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.320
Yeah, could be, yeah.

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:20.320
Did you work in the holidays then, or did you have the holidays off, do you remember?

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.320
No, I can't remember.

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:26.320
No, I think we were working in school holidays.

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:33.320
Because my children were looking after the small ones then, I think we were working on school holidays.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.320
So we were.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.320
Right. Did you enjoy working there?

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:44.320
Yes, they were good and they were good. Crowd there, you know, right, those two them, yeah.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:49.320
Did you meet up with them, you know, socially at all?

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:57.320
Oh yes, we went out for a meal and a drink sort of thing on Christmas time and we all enjoyed, yeah.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.320
Don't ask me where we went, I can't remember.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.320
But there was a load of us and we really enjoyed it, yeah.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.320
How many, it was women mostly then?

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.320
Oh yes, women mostly, yes.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.320
Were you supervised by a woman or by a man?

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.320
By the woman, by the woman, yeah.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.320
Would you have liked to have been a supervisor?

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.320
No, too much responsibility on that, no.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.320
Do you remember the supervisor though, was she quite strict?

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.320
No, they were good, no, no, they were very good to us.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:33.320
They weren't nasty and nothing like that. If we'd done anything wrong they'd just tell us where we'd gone wrong.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.320
Was it, no, you see it all in the factory?

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:41.320
It was a little bit, not much, mind you, it was, because there's machines there as well, like see.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.320
So it was a bit, but not so much as all that.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:48.320
And did you, were you allowed to talk when you were working or did you have to?

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.320
No, we could talk, yeah, we could talk, as long as we'd done the work.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:57.320
As long as it was going out they don't care. Yeah, we were talking.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.320
And I know you like singing, did you sing at all as you worked?

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.320
No, no, they didn't know I could sing.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.320
And was there music on at all, do you remember I think?

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.320
Yeah, there was music on, but it was very cold there.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.320
It was cold in the winter there, but they did bring the machines out.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:20.320
I didn't know this gas, but it was very sickly and it was horrible.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.320
That's the only thing we could have is to keep us warm.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:29.320
And of course the summer then, they did bring us drinks around for us because it was so warm there.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.320
We had a nice summer then.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:36.320
And we were having free drinks then to cool us down a bit.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.320
So what drinks were they then? Squash.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.320
Squash, yeah, squash, let's see.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.320
So why was it hot then there?

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.320
Well, it was glass up top as well, see.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:49.320
So the bed was cold and the bed was hot.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:53.320
What about the union then, did you come out and strike about that at all?

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:59.320
No, I don't think so. No, I can't remember coming out and strike there.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:07.320
Was it in any way dangerous, you know, that the work, that you could hurt yourself at all?

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.320
You were talking about your mother and the tinworks.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.320
Oh yeah, the tinworks.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.320
Was there any?

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.320
Well, perhaps there could be.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:21.320
There were some machines, if you could watch them, yes.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:26.320
There were some machines that you've got to watch where your fingers and things are going.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.320
Were you hurt at all?

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.320
No, that's the word, no.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.320
Was there a nurse there?

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.320
Oh yes, a nurse was there, yes, a nurse was there.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.320
So what did she do then, if there were people who weren't being hurt?

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:48.320
Well, she'd put her in her office and bandaged them up if they cut themselves or things, so they'd do things like that.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:52.320
Or if anybody was taken ill, they'd send them home then.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.320
So anybody was taken ill.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.320
She was there full time, was she?

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.320
Yes, she was there full time, yes.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:03.320
What about the working day now?

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.320
Trina, you're going half past nine.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.320
Did you have a break at dinnertime or what happened?

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.320
Oh yes, we do have a break for dinnertime.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.320
Yes, we had breaks there.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.320
Did they have a canteen?

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.320
Yes, they got a canteen there.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:22.320
But I was taking my own food, I was though, because I didn't care much for the canteen food there.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.320
But I was buying some sometimes.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.320
But my daughter, I was taking my own.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:34.320
Did you have a break in the morning as well, and in the afternoon, because you were part time now?

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:43.320
Well, we did in the summer, because it was so warm there, we were having a ten minutes break, because it was so warm in the summer.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:47.320
Ten minutes break in the morning and afternoon as well.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:54.320
That's when we was over meadow, when we were doing full time then, when we were working full time that was.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.320
But not in Fisher Price?

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.320
No.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:01.320
Did the women smoke at all?

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.320
Oh yes.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.320
What happened if they smoked? Do they smoke in the factory?

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:10.320
Oh no, they didn't smoke in the factory. They had to go outside to smoke in the factories.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:15.320
Or in the canteen then, because it was those days.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.320
Outside they had to do it, they don't do it inside.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.320
You didn't smoke yourself?

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.320
No.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.320
But the toilets, were there enough toilets there?

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.320
Yes, nice toilets there.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.320
So there were men now, there were men working in the factories?

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.320
Oh yes, there were men working.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.320
What were they doing?

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:47.320
Well, they were taking the toys and the trolleys and things, and I think some of them, because in the Metjoys they had paid things there to the wealthy to pay some of the toys, so mostly they were there.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:52.320
But I think some of the women had been doing that as well, as I was told.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.320
And some of the women were doing it as well.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.320
Right.

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.320
Yes, in the paint shop there.

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:06.320
So if the men came into the factory, went in the lines where you were, did you tease them and provoke them? Was there a banter between the women and the men?

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:11.320
No, some of them, if we did tease some of them, yeah, they teased us back.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:17.320
Yeah, because they were nice men, they were very nice. Yeah, we were teasing them.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.320
What did you say to them?

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.320
Oh, I can't remember.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.320
Are you not going to remember either?

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.320
Oh, I can't remember what you said to them.

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.320
But there was banter and fun then?

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.320
Oh yes, yes, it was more or less that.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:33.320
Did they play any sort of tricks on new girls who came to the factory?

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.320
No, they didn't.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.320
So you can't remember anything like that at all?

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.320
No, they didn't do it to us any of them.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.320
They were very good to us, yeah.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.320
And often they were showing us what to do.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.320
So that's how you learnt, is you were watching others?

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.320
Yeah, and they were telling us, yeah.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.320
No, they weren't doing anything like that.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.320
Okay.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.320
Then you moved on to METOI.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:24:02.320
What was the difference between Fisher Price and METOI? What did you say? Was there something, did you notice a lot of difference?

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:09.320
Oh, yeah, as you see, a lot of difference, as regards for the toys, because METOI were making more cars and things.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:13.320
When Fisher Price, they were making more different things.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:25.320
And I fancy they were easy to make then, METOI itself, because you could put little things with the cars and things like that.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:29.320
So what did you do in METOI? What exactly were you doing? You were on the line again?

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.320
Yeah, I was on the line.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.320
What was that?

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.320
Were you working on the cars?

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.320
Some cars, I know.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.320
Yeah, some cars. I'm trying to remember.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:47.320
Oh, we were doing those tops, you know, you press down, they spin.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.320
Remember those?

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.320
We were doing them as well.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.320
Now, something's coming to me now.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.320
We were making them as well.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.320
I can't remember what else.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.320
Those were made of metal?

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.320
Yes, that was metal, that is.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.320
So we were making them there.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:07.320
Not only cars, we were making other things, which I can't remember.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.320
Cars we were doing and that top we were doing as well.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.320
And what else were we doing?

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:22.320
Oh, and the roundabout, the swings on them, you know, we were doing them as well.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.320
So this was much more smaller?

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.320
Yes, much smaller.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:32.320
Not only cars we were doing, we were doing other things as well, there in metals.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.320
So you moved around to different things?

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.320
Yeah.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.320
Did you find it more for sea work?

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:41.320
Well, it is with the little things we had to put in, yes.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.320
It was very tricky, some of them were.

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:47.320
Did you enjoy that better? Which would you enjoy most, the Fisher Price or metal?

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:52.320
Oh, no, I think Fisher Price was the best as it comes for toys.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.320
And as a place to work?

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.320
Yes, it was good, yes, it was nice there.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:03.320
Well, as it was, there wasn't many there, because it was a small place, see, so.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.320
What happened then? Why did that close?

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.320
I don't know, I don't know why they closed.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:15.320
I suppose they couldn't afford the materials or something like that.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.320
And yet they are still making them.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.320
Did the whole factory close?

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:23.320
Yes, all of them is closed down there now.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.320
I don't know if there is anything down there now.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.320
So METOI didn't take over the Fisher Price?

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.320
No.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.320
They were next door?

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.320
Yeah, they were next door, see, they were already there before them.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.320
I don't know how long the Fisher Price was there, mate, I don't know.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:42.320
So with the METOI, sorry, with the Fisher Price, were you given any redundancy pay?

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:48.320
How long did you, when did you hear about it and were you given any pay and what was the difference then?

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:52.320
I can't remember, no, we didn't have redundancy from them, no.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.320
It's only from METOI we had.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.320
No, I can't remember that.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:04.320
So you were told that it was closing?

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:09.320
Yeah, and we had to go over, well it's up to you if you want to go over to METOI,

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:15.320
but we did go for a while to part-time,

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:21.320
but then it came then that you had to go full-time.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.320
So either that or you were actually left.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.320
So quite a few left then, didn't they?

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:32.320
No, the few left them because that children there, because they didn't have nobody to look after them.

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:38.320
But me and my friend stopped for a while and she left as well, so I stayed on.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:44.320
So how long were you in METOI for? Do you remember what time you left that? Left there?

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:49.320
Well, we were made to run, it was 1973, see, so.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.320
That was from Fisher Price?

00:27:51.320 --> 00:28:01.320
No, no, from METOI. I can't remember what year we went from Fisher Price to METOI, I can't remember.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:08.320
But I remember, well I looked at that bit, it was 1973 that we were made redundant in METOI.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:12.320
So I should have been about, I'd say nine or ten years there.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.320
Alright.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.320
Should have been, could be less, might.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:21.320
Okay, okay. Were you given any sort of training at all of what to do in METOI?

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.320
No.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.320
Nothing at all?

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:30.320
No, we just, they show you and then they stay by you to see that you were doing it right, like, see.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:35.320
Okay. And were you, did you have to wear a uniform at all in METOI either?

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:36.320
No.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:42.320
Neither of them, okay. And was that because you were working with metal and smaller things, was that more dangerous?

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.320
Or, or, you know, could you have an accident doing that, or?

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.320
No, I don't think so, no.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.320
Because you know today, health and safety is important.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.320
Yes, yeah.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.320
Was that a factor then, or?

00:28:55.320 --> 00:29:01.320
No, I don't think it was so much then as it is now. No, it was.

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:09.320
Okay. Would you say that, you know, that the working in METOI or in Fisher Price has affected your health in any way?

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.320
Well, it didn't affect mine any of it.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.320
I don't think it has.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.320
I know.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:23.320
Right, okay. When you were working now in Fisher Price, did you work every day of the week, or was it just Monday to Friday, or what did you do?

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:33.320
No, we worked, we, first I wanted us to come in on a Saturday, we were going in on a Saturday as well to have, what do you call it now?

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.320
It was extra pay?

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:41.320
Yeah. Oh, I can't remember, oh, you call it now. Yeah, we were having extra then by going in on a Saturday, see.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.320
That was something extra.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:46.320
Yes, a bit extra then, see. Yes.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.320
So there was shifts obviously in these factories.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.320
Oh, yes.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:55.320
What were the other shifts then? You know, you started at half past nine, did the other girls go off then?

00:29:55.320 --> 00:30:03.320
Oh, yes, they finished then, no, they, well, at half past nine, they were half past three, it was supposed to be then.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:07.320
They did have shifts there, they had afternoons and evenings there, see.

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.320
Did they have night shifts as well?

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:13.320
Yeah, they got night shifts at night, yes. Yeah, they got night shifts as well.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:21.320
So did you have bank holiday off, you know, would that have been a, did you work on a bank holiday at all? Christmas and?

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:25.320
Oh, yeah, well, they'd re-hard them off, re-hard them off.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:30.320
So the extra pay, the time and a half?

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.320
Yeah, time and a half, something like that, see.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.320
Did you work on Sundays at all?

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:36.320
No, we didn't work on Sundays, no, only on Saturdays.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.320
Well, there was no buses on Sundays then, you know.

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:40.320
No.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.320
No Saturdays, yeah.

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:46.320
Right. You know, as a job, would you have said that it was boring or?

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.320
No.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.320
No?

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:53.320
No, boring at all. I've got time to go, but it'd be boring.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.320
It was hard work then, isn't it?

00:30:54.320 --> 00:31:02.320
It was hard work, yes. It keeps you going then, especially if you've got to do your target, you've got to go quick.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:11.320
Right. And you didn't have any choice about leaving either factory, both, did the METO close, is that why you, the factory closed, is that why you were made redundant in?

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:14.320
Yeah, they were making, yes, they were closing as well.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.320
Yes, that was closing as well, see.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.320
So both factories closed.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.320
Yeah.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.320
Ah, right, okay.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.320
Yeah.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:21.320
How did you feel about that? Did you feel sad that you were leaving?

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:27.320
Yes, I did feel a bit sad because I did enjoy myself there and the money was handy as well.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:30.320
And was there sort of friendship with the other girls?

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.320
Yes, there was a friendship for them as well, yeah.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.320
Have you kept in touch with some of the girls there?

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:44.320
No, we haven't. Some of them I've seen don't go saying then, but most of them are gone now as well.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:49.320
So you didn't have a sort of retirement gift or?

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:54.320
No, no, they didn't give us that, no. They didn't give us anything.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:32:00.320
And then did they have things like social club at all in METO, you know?

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:01.320
No.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.320
No, nothing like that?

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.320
No, we didn't have nothing like that.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.320
Football teams or cricket teams or anything?

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.320
No, nothing like that, no.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.320
The bosses didn't bring people together at all?

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.320
No.

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:11.320
Did you see the bosses at all?

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.320
No, we'd never seen them.

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.320
Just the supervisors?

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:19.320
And the girls was always there, we never saw the men.

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.320
But the foreman was here?

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:30.320
Yeah, he was around sometimes, yes. If there was any problems with the machines that they had, he'd come and have a look at it.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.320
So who mended the machines, would that be men?

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:40.320
Well, yeah, we got men. Well, some of them, my young boys would come there as well and ought to do jobs there as well.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:48.320
Where did the other girls come from who worked there? Did they come from Goseinon, Lachau?

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:53.320
Well, when we were in the Fish and Price, they were coming from Port Talbot.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:59.320
Some of them were, yeah, from Port Talbot. They had the bus then coming from there, see.

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:06.320
But they were all over the shop, really, but I know them from Port Talbot, because we were always together then on the line, like, see.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.320
The majority of them is Swansea.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.320
And the language was English, was it? Or was it Welsh at all?

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:18.320
I didn't hear anybody speaking Welsh, most likely there was, there might, but I didn't hear anything.

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:22.320
What about the Swansea girls? Were they, what were they like?

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:26.320
Yes, they were all right, yeah. They were all right.

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:29.320
I've heard stories about some of the Swansea girls. What do you think?

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:38.320
They can be nasty, mind, but they're good to work with, mind. Yeah, they're good to work with, but don't cross her.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:43.320
What was their language like in the factory, you know? Is there a bit of blue language there?

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:48.320
No, no, there was nothing like that there, fair does, no. Nothing like that there, no.

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:56.320
Okay, all right. So, when you look back now at the days in the factory, what stays in your mind, you know?

00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:00.320
When you look back at, your memory goes back to those times.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:05.320
What are the most interesting or important things that you remember of that time?

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:13.320
Well, when I started in Fishing Price, in the way, making those toys.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:19.320
That's what I can remember, making that little dog and things like that.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:23.320
And the women as well, you know, going out.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:31.320
And one time we were going in and they were taking us to...

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.320
Oh, what's that name now?

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:42.320
We had to go to another factory to do something there. I can't remember what it was, though.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:47.320
But we had to have the best to go. But we never did anything there.

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:52.320
So, we enjoyed that. We were in the bus. I mean, friend in the bus we were.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.320
Not in Port Talbot.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:35:00.320
So, you were supposed to be showing another company, another group how to do things, were you?

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.320
Or just meeting up with them?

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:08.320
No, I think it's to show them how to do some toys there.

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:12.320
I'm trying to picture where it was.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:19.320
But then we didn't get there. We didn't do anything in there.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:23.320
We were sitting outside. It was a lovely day. We just sat on the wall talking.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.320
We never went in the factory.

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:31.320
I don't know what it was. We were doing something inside a factory or something, so we couldn't do nothing.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:37.320
So, we sat outside and we enjoyed buying ice cream. And that was some ice cream as well.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:41.320
I can't remember what it was.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:44.320
So, did they organise any trips out at all for you?

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.320
Like a trip in the summer or something?

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.320
No.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:50.320
Any parties for children or anything?

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:56.320
No, nothing like that. Only that time we went out together for the Christmas.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:01.320
What about if you wanted to buy some of those toys? Could you do that? You know you had children.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.320
Oh yes, you can buy them.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:09.320
Eh? Come on, was there any pilfering there?

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.320
Come on, I want you to look at this.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.320
There might have been.

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:14.320
What might have been? What happened? Go on.

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:21.320
Well, some of them were taking some of the cars with them. But they were broken. No, they weren't what? They were called car proper cars.

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.320
They were seconds.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:26.320
They were seconds. They were seconds they were. So, we were taking them.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.320
They were borrowing these, were they?

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.320
Yeah, they were taking them.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.320
But was there a shop there that you could go and buy?

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.320
Oh yes, there was a shop there. You could make them pricey, yeah.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.320
Were they cheaper then?

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:43.320
Yeah, they were cheaper for us here. Because we were working there. You could buy them a lot of toys there if you wanted them, yeah.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:50.320
Were you a friend in Llyca? Did they ask you to buy some for them for Christmas and things? Were you allowed to do that?

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:58.320
Oh yes, we were allowed to do that. If I tell them in the shop that they got such things then, they'd ask them,

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:04.320
well, no to get them for them for Christmas then. They were giving me the money and I was getting them for them then.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.320
Were you getting them a little bit cheaper?

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.320
Oh yeah, I was getting them a bit cheaper then, yes.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:11.320
Okay. But there was some pilfring going on there, wasn't there?

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:17.320
Well, second hand ones, aye. Well, they didn't want that so they might as well have it in that.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:20.320
They were only thrown away, they'd be.

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:24.320
Okay, lovely. Okay then, I think that's it really.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.320
That's it?
