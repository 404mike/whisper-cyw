Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.960
Interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.160
Interviewee Lucy Price.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.840
Location of the interview is the Swicker office in Market House.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.240
Today's date is the 28th of September 2015.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:27.160
Before we start Lucy, could you be kind enough to spell your name in full please?

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.920
Lucy Price.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:40.160
Thank you very much. So Lucy, how did you become involved with Cardiff Carnival?

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.200
I became involved with Cardiff Carnival through the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:53.200
So I was doing my Masters in Arts Management there and we had to do a professional placement and I chose to go with Swicker Carnival.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:01:02.160
So I know for a fact that you were very helpful helping us do research into various income streams and crowdfunding.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:13.720
But as part of your time with Gloria Swicker, of course, you took part on an extensive and immersive basis at the carnival camp.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.600
What was that like as an experience?

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.400
It was absolutely brilliant. It was something I didn't expect at all.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.600
Bearing in mind that we've been trained on very dry, very management style stuff to then go and get stuck in was really great.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.600
Stuck on as well actually.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.600
The amount of glue I went through, I'm not surprised.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.600
It was amazing. I always liked arts and design and stuff.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.600
But to actually get there, to go and get involved with everyone and to get to make my own costume was amazing.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.600
Tell us a bit more about your costume because what can I say?

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.600
It was a beautiful costume, well made.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.800
Where did the idea come from and how did you make it?

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.800
The idea came from Adrian.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:03.800
Adrian, lead designer, designed the basic shape for me because he had something in his mind and then set me to it.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:12.800
So it was a main fan and then with three fans at the back.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It was all in shades of yellow and gold and black with a massive big yellow feather headdress.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
It was great. It took me pretty much the length of the whole camp to make it.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I took it all the way from the very beginning through making the shape of a fibreglass pole and attaching it to the backpack

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:46.200
and doing all the fabric and the design and then gluing on infinite amounts of feathers and sequins and varying forms of glitter.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.200
How are your glue gun burns?

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.200
They're just about healed. I did lose a pair of jeans though.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.200
Were you in them at the time?

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.200
No, I spotted them later. I was like, oh my leg's sparkling.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.200
And they said, oh wait, no, that's still glue from glitter everywhere.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.400
My flat was permanently glittery for the whole time. I think I worked at Twicker.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.400
Of course, the camp aspires to be and is a genuinely sort of happy place.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:24.400
What would you describe, I suppose on one level, you were in the inner sanctum with the seamstress and those who know how to make big things.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.400
In the even larger room next to you were the community groups working away.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:37.600
Give us a clue as to what did it feel like to be there? What was the ambience like? What was the noise like? What were the noise levels like?

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:44.600
Art was brilliant. Everyone was just so excited about it all the time. Everyone was so happy to be there and so keen to be involved.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.600
There was such a range of people, I think.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:56.600
I always loved the friendly rivalry between different costumes and who had the most feathers and the sequins and the glitter and who looked more fabulous.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.800
It was just a great atmosphere. Everyone wanted to be so colourful and so flamboyant and so fun. It was just sort of buzzing the whole time.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.800
Life-affirming?

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.800
Oh, definitely, yeah.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:13.800
Sounds good. Of course, the great day dawned and a bit like today, it was a beautiful, beautiful sunny day.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.800
You put on this amazing creation.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.800
I did.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:25.800
How windy was the day? What were the ups and downs? What challenges did you face, Lucy?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
What challenges did you face?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Parading this large-scale backpack costume through the city centre.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Well, small spaces were always an issue for me. Any height restrictions were a bit of a...

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000
No, it was actually amazing. I did wake up the morning of Carnival and go, oh dear God, what have I signed up for?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
But then I was like, no, actually, the minute I got that costume on and I got out that door, it was so much fun.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:59.200
And yeah, it was a bit windy. I think coming round by the Goody Hoo was a battle against the elements.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.200
I nearly went sideways at one point because I basically had a massive wind sail.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.200
Last scene, heading in the Barry direction, Lucy Price.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.200
Yeah, I also got stuck on a lamppost at one point. That was a highlight. That's how big the costume was.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.200
Excellent.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.200
But no, it was...

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.200
How did you get yourself un-extricated from a lamppost?

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.400
Luckily, some person by helped me out.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.400
Petch was there as well. Petch was in a costume like mine. She managed to help me out.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.400
But yeah, there was a moment when I was just like, oh no, try and dance it off.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.400
But yeah, it was awesome.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.400
And it was, yeah, like I said, I was a bit nervous to start with.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.400
Then it was kind of, I think, once you get into the spirit of it and that sort of energy that goes round

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.400
and everyone's sort of, especially when everyone's lined up ready to go before the Carnival starts, that's just...

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.600
That's a feverish expectation about the place, isn't it?

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.600
It's been an out-of-body experience.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.600
And the great Cardiff public, how did they react to you?

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.600
Oh, it was lovely. Everyone was so excited to see everyone and people out in the world.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.600
Were people asking you to stop and post photographs?

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.600
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.600
That sounds nice.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.600
A lot of pictures. A lot of pictures. I had to put my best cheesy grin on.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.600
Excellent.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.600
Try not to blink too much, which I always do.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.600
But yeah, no, it was brilliant. It was lovely. The atmosphere was just, everyone was so...

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.800
Everyone in the crowd was just so happy and so joyous. It was nice.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:25.800
So Carnival, very positive experience. If you had to sum it up in a few words...

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.800
Oh, don't do this to me.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.800
Okay, if you didn't have to sum it up in a few words...

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.800
I had a paragraph when I said...

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.800
Carnival was just amazing. It was just so sort of immersive and so like...

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Just so much joy and fun and happiness I think it brings.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
That amount of colour and glitter in anyone's life is...

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
It's got to be a good thing.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Yeah, it's got to be. I had an amazing time when I was here.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Bless you. Well, thank you for all your contribution, not only in Carnival, but to the company as a whole.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
I hereby declare that you, Lucy Price, are a Carnival hero. Thank you very much.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Yay, thank you.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
You've now entered history.
