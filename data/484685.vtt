Steve stories. My name is Steve Fletcher and in 1990 I founded Swickr Carnival

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.660
who have organized Cardiff Carnival ever since.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:20.480
Steve stories number one. Swickr Carnival begins. My working life in the arts and

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.840
Cardiff Carnival are closely linked. I started Swickr Carnival in 1990 over 25

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.520
years ago but the idea of an ongoing carnival arts organization covering

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.160
South Wales to deliver large-scale community participation and celebration

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.880
crystallized the year before in 1989. In that year I was working with a

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.120
groundbreaking theatre company based in Cardiff called Theatre Taliesin Wales

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.440
who I helped produce a trilogy of Indo-Celtic community plays. The

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.960
community plays used parallels between stories and art forms from India and

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.440
Wales and brought together hundreds of community performers and were enjoyed by

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.840
large family audiences. All the community plays were based at the Gujarati

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.000
Samaj Centre in Grangetown in Cardiff and part of my job was to publicize and

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.480
recruit community performers many of whom had no previous experience in the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.280
arts and once they were on board to try to ensure they enjoyed the opportunity

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.360
to the max. The community plays were very successful short-term projects

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.360
however after three years it was quite clear to me that Theatre Taliesin Wales

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.800
had helped create a huge wellspring of enthusiasm and interest from people from

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.760
different backgrounds coming together using intercultural arts to create

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:51.240
something fabulous and enjoyable for all to view. So in 1990 when Glasgow was

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.640
appointed European City of Culture I set up an intercultural project for that

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.680
company in Glasgow. This meant that the head of steam built up by their work in

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.680
Cardiff had come to an end and many would-be participants and future

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.320
audiences in Cardiff were doomed to disappointment. So the stage was set for

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.360
a new ongoing arts organization to be based in Cardiff to expand upon

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.960
Taliesin's earlier successes and so South Wales Intercultural Community Arts

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:31.840
better known as SWCCA was born. SWCCA officially started in April 1990 and our

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.920
first two workshops in that month involved samba drumming and carnival

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.600
arts. The samba drumming workshop took place at the City Centre Youth Project

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.840
in Charles Street, Cardiff and was the first ever of its sort in Wales. It was

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.520
so successful that SWCCA Carnival started Samba Galaise, the Cardiff School of

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.240
Samba which continued to this very day as a successful community percussion

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.640
group and in turn has inspired several more ongoing samba drumming groups right

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.960
across Wales. The second workshop in April 1990 involved introducing carnival

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.740
arts to Cardiff and my point of inspiration was the wonderfully

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.480
flamboyant carnival form found in Trinidad and across the Caribbean. This

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.760
carnival tradition is known as the M.A.S.S. M.A.S.S. is short for the word

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.200
masquerade. SWCCA Carnival brought Catherine Chan, carnival designer and

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.080
M.A.S.S. maker from Trinidad to Cardiff and the first carnival arts workshops

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.640
took place in Mount Stewart Junior School in Cardiff Bay which was then the

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.040
most culturally diverse school in the whole of Wales and also on an open

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.580
access basis at the family-friendly Cardiff City Farm on Sloper Road which has

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.400
now sadly been replaced by commercial development.
