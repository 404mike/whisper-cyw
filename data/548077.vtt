00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In silent love we've gone, And we've been far from home.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
At the blood and nail of Christ, And in love in death's increase,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
He guard us in dear life home, When in youth our prayers sit home.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
God, in thy blood rule, God, in thy blood rule.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
In silent love we've gone, And we've been far from home.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now we're bound above your rule, In death's increase, God, life you do.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
God, our Lord, in death's own death, Holy are you, right over him.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
God, in thy blood rule, God, in thy blood rule.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
In silent love we've gone, And we've been far from home.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Midride of the young guy D, Yes, he grist the throne as free.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Guy with one whole blood, all blue, Has no head, with all in blue.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:28.000
God, in thy blood rule, God, in thy blood rule.
