00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Track three, I'd much rather have the fresh air of the mountains.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.620
As you can see, it's not much of a forest yet. Not too many tall trees to speak of.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.200
What with the German submarines, the U-boats, targeting our merchant ships, we've got to

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.960
become more self-sufficient, they say, even though the wars ended.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.520
The girls from the forestry commission are busy planting this up with softwoods. Quick

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.120
growers from Scandinavia.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.200
Oh, the trees, that is.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.200
The forestry girls are local. Most of them are only young, 15, 16 or so. They didn't

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.080
join the land army, just got a job with the forestry. They weren't best pleased to find

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.520
out they were getting paid half what we did. And they don't get the beret either.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.760
It was an easy choice for me, you know, joining the timber corps. I'd much rather have the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.080
fresh air of the mountains than the confines of a munitions factory.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.480
And the uniform? Rather fetching, don't you think?

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.680
I remember a big brown paper parcel being delivered just a few days after passing my

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.680
medical. I spread everything across the bed, then proceeded to try it all on. Green jerseys,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.380
riding breeches, dungarees, woolen knee socks, beige knit shirts and a tie.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.880
We had a pair of boots, brown shoes and gum boots, plus overall coats, one melting overcoat

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.400
and a macintosh. And there at the bottom in a separate wrapping was my green armlet,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.040
a metal badge and the bakelite badge for my green beret. I felt really important.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.240
To this day, Mrs Lloyd, my landlady, even scrubs my boots. They're a lovely couple,

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.000
they are. It's a good thing though, because there's just one room downstairs, no kitchen

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.800
and the toilet is down steps by the river. Upstairs has two bedrooms, a single room that

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.160
Mr and Mrs Lloyd are in and a double bedroom for me. And as it turned out, Lily. We had

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.560
to share the small space, sleeping head to toe. She was a lovely lass too, but like all

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.000
the other girls, they were only here for a few months before moving on. Oh, I just need

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.480
to nip over to Violet, one of the forestry girls planting just over there. Hold that

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.480
thought and I'll catch up with you later.
