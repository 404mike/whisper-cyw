It does give you the chance to see, I suppose, more of the background to Wales and what Wales

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:20.000
is about, but so do some of the English language programmes that are made in Wales, I think,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.960
too. I mean, programmes just like Doctor Who, you know, it's very interesting for people

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.000
to think, oh, Ascardiff, I've been there, I've seen that, you know. I think it makes

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.800
people feel that you're really part of the modern world, you know. The thing about Welshness

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:47.800
is you're proud of it, well, I am anyway, but you're still part of the world and I

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:56.800
think you have to accept that you're part of the greater thing. Because I, you know,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.800
the referendum, the, what do you call it, census came around recently, what do you

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.200
feel, you know, when you take these things and do you feel Welsh, do you feel British?

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.100
Yes, I take both because I do, because Wales is not divorced from Britain and it can never

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.600
be divorced from Britain because it's attached to Britain as an island, whether

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.600
the Doggers will be as a political identity, I don't know, but at the moment it is, so

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:33.900
yes, I feel both. And I think that's why things like the coronation and those, people

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.700
can feel both and it doesn't bother them.
