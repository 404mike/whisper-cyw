00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So I look at the camera? Yes please.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:13.000
My name is Bilkis. My date of birth is 1st of August 1956.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:23.000
My name is Bilkis Akhtar Chauhan and I was born on 1st of August 1956.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.000
What is your first memory of you growing up?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In Pakistan we were five brothers and three sisters.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:53.000
My main memory is the place we lived, the village. There was no running water.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We used to go to the river. It was one of the five rivers by our house.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We used to go to the river to fetch water.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
How old were you?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We were five, six, seven. We used to go in the evening because ladies were not allowed to go during the day.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So we used to go with our mothers in the evening.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
What are the types of games you remember playing or enjoyed?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We used to play with a ball. It was a game called Shatapu.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I don't know what you call it in English.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It was our neighbor's house. They had a big garden there. So we used to play there.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It goes off every Monday at this time because it's their routine.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:12.000
We used to play in the streets.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Did you play different types of games?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Not that much because the girls...

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Again?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Tell us about the type of things you would do when you were playing in the streets.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000
That's all I remember. We used to have a PE in school.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
School wasn't very far from our house.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I liked going to school. Maths was my favorite subject.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:30.000
We played with the cousins mostly because we were all in the street or relatives used to live.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So we played with the cousins.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
What celebrations or traditions do you remember sharing with families and your cousins and everyone that was around you?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:49.000
We have two Eids in a year. So Eid was a special time.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Men used to go to read Eid Namaz in the mosque.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Ladies stayed at home. We cooked in the morning. My mom did.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
My nanny, my grandmother used to come and help.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000
When our dad comes back from Eid Namaz, he used to bring balloons.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
He gave us money for Eid.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Then we used to go to a sort of Eid Mela.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Over there there were swings and stalls, different types of stalls and swings.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
We used to enjoy that.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000
The second Eid is the Qurbani, when they sacrifice a lamb.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
So that was a good time as well.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Why is it important to still have these traditions and celebrations?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Because we're Muslims and that Qurbani is one of the...

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000
In religion, we fast for a month, then we celebrate with the Eid.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000
So all the family gets together and we have a celebration then.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Again, growing up, what would you say is your favorite memory?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Going to school or going to my khalas' house and play with my cousins.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.000
We used to have a swing on the big tree and we used to swing on that.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Play there.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:06:00.000
So then just to flip it on the other side, what do you think about the childhood here in the UK versus Pakistan?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
What the childhood for my children.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
You can look at your children as an example.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:15.000
It's totally different, because over there we didn't have that many toys, didn't have that many facilities.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:23.000
But it's more here. In a way it was better, communication wise it was better there.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:33.000
But over here, financially you are better off and you have more toys and more things to play with.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And then traveling to the UK, what made you decide to come to the UK?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
I didn't decide to come.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
I got married. My father passed away.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And in Muslims we do get married without cousins.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
So I got married to my cousin.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000
They came to this country in 1966.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:15.000
My aunt and my husband, they went back when my father passed away.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.000
So they asked for my marriage and then we got married.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
I came after a year then.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
So then you came in 1967.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
1967.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000
1960. No, no. My husband's family was here from 1966.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And my dad passed away in 1973.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:52.000
So what were your expectations of the UK or life in the UK?

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:03.000
I think I was too young to know what I want or what's there.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
I got married and came down.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And that was my family then.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
That was my uncle and auntie and their children.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
I came as a doctor-in-law.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
So over there when you get married and you go into the family,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
so the daughter-in-law's responsibilities are to look after the house,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
the cooking, the cleaning.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
How old were you?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Which I found very... I was 18 when I came.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.000
I came in June and I was 18 in August.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I'm sorry, what were you about to say which you found very...

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
It was difficult, very, very difficult at the time.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Leaving your family there.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And you don't know many people apart from my cousins,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
but they were over here since 1965.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
So I only seen them when I was about six or seven.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So it was very, very difficult.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
What can you say is the most important thing that you had to leave behind?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And how did you feel about it?

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
The family, leaving behind the family.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And yeah, family mostly.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And culture, over here there was no...

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Like nowadays there's television, there's more communication.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000
But back then it was only half an hour program on the telly, weekly.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Which we used to watch and used to look forward to that program in the morning.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Or there was a mosque there and we used to go to mosque to read Jumma Namaz.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Apart from that I was in the house most of the time.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000
How did you get to the UK or how did you travel to the UK?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
I came by myself because I got married in 1973.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
But I had my visa in 1974.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
So I travelled by myself.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
By plane?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000
By plane, yeah.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:28.000
What could you say was the best or the worst thing about that journey?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Best thing was I was excited to come here as well.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
As you know I was upset to leave my family.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
I was excited to come because my husband did go once again.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Like when I got married he went there.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And then after that about seven, eight months he went back again.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
But I didn't have the visa at the time so I couldn't come back with him.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
So I came back about three, four months later.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
But I was excited to come here.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Because England was England.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000
So when did you arrive in Newport?

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000
I lived in London for ten years because my in-laws are in London.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
So I came to my in-laws house.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
We stayed there for ten years.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I didn't stay with my mother in their family house.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Back then, I don't know if you can do it now or not,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
back then you used to apply for council flats.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Some of us applied for council flats.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Which we got after about two years, year and a half.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
So we moved there.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
We stayed there about three years.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Then we bought our own house.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And we moved there.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And by then I had a daughter.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
So is this in Newport then?

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
No, no, it's still in London.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
So then yeah, when did you?

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
1986 I moved to Wales.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
I came in 1974 to London.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
I moved here in 1986.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:27.000
What do you recall about the first few days and few months that you were in Newport?

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000
It was nice because we wanted to buy a business.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
My husband had a leather factory, making leather garments in London.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000
My husband and his dad and brothers, they were all in partners.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
But the business went down so we were looking for a business.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
We went up north first.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
On the way back, my husband's friend was living in Newport.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
So we came to see him.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And my husband liked the place and said we'll move here.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
So we bought a house here first and then we found a business.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:15.000
What other challenges can you say that you face to really establish yourself in Newport?

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Mostly with my children because we moved to Cleon.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Moved in Cleon.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
My daughter was 11 and the younger daughter was three and a half.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:33.000
The younger daughter settled in okay, but the eldest one, she had problems in school.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Racism.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Because there was only three children in the whole of the school at that time.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
So she didn't settle properly here.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
She didn't like it much.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
But the younger one settled okay.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Used to bring them to mosque for religious reading.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Did any of your friends or family join you in the UK?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
I came to my in-laws house.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
None of my family came here.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Even after, even when you...

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
They came when my daughter got married recently.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:28.000
What was that like as well and how do you feel about your children coming to mosque with you and learning about the traditions?

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:35.000
It's important to know your roots and your religion.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000
So I used to take them to mosque to read Quran and to read Namaz.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Culture wise I missed a lot here because in London there was a bit more than in Newport.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:00.000
When we were in the Asian area, so there was more things done in cultural wise.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
But in Newport at that time it wasn't that much.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And then again we bought the business and busy as well.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
What do you love the most about your culture?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Most is getting together.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Getting together on occasions.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000
So then you spoke about this a little bit.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:40.000
What parts of the culture have you made to make sure that, to preserve and to keep?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Whether that be the traditions or the customs or the language, food or the festivals.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:55.000
I think both religious wise I have taken my daughters to mosques to read the Quran.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Culturally we dress up in our traditional dresses whenever we go to see our own families.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Especially on Eid we get together and have our own food.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
If you say special food on Eid.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Have you studied here as well?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
No.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
What about work and jobs?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
In London I helped. I knew sewing a bit when I was in Pakistan.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
In school we learned sewing.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000
At home we used to do embroidery and I learned it from my mom.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
When I came here my husband and their family was in leather business.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
So we had a sewing machine at home.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
So I made the lining of the jackets.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
That's how I started sewing.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
So I made lining for our own factory.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
And then I worked for other factories but still at home.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Working from home.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Made skirts, blouses, bright made dresses.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
So I've done sewing for at least 10 years.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
You're still doing it.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Yeah, still doing it now.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Can you describe how you became a part of or involved in Age of Life?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Age of Life. We had a shop as I said.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
We were looking for a business that's why we moved here.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
So we had a convenience store.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
We had it for 7 years.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Then we had a break for 2 years.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000
And then we were hoping to sell it but couldn't sell it at the time.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
So we had that business back and we went in for another 8 years.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000
After that my health wasn't that great.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
And my husband had a bypass as well.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
So we decided to sell the business.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
So we sold the business.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
As I said my health wasn't that great so I couldn't work for anybody else.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
I'd done voluntary work for a couple of years.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
And by then I met a few people along the way.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
And I came to Age of Life.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Age of Life has given me a lot in a way.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:38.000
I wasn't that confident to speak to other people, to get involved in different things.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
I knew how to work because I worked in the shop.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
I knew I could communicate.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:53.000
But I always found it hard confidence wise.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
But since I am in the group my confidence has built up.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
And there's something to look forward to every week.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
And now I go to people in groups.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
I do some voluntary work.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
And that's good.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000
And the other groups have come from you being a part of Age of Life and growing your own confidence.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
That's right, growing my own confidence and meeting other people.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
They knew for being like a copy and a half.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
So we went to copy and a half.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
And in copy and a half I met these ladies, Beechwood Stitches.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
So I go there.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Which is very good.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:49.000
And when you think about Age of Life, are there one or two events that stand out for you?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Are there any events?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
I like going to trips.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
And I like to be in.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
That's my best part in the Age of Life is because I'm a committee member as well.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Which I enjoy.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
I always like maths in school.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
So I enjoy that.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:21.000
And how do you think Age of Life supports Black or Asian or any other ethnic groups?

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:34.000
We are by getting together and we try our best to involve if we see anybody who we think is lonely or need anybody.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
And we always invite them to come to our group.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.000
And lastly, have you kept any kind of family heirlooms, like photographs or ornaments?

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Yes.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Why are they important to you?

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Photographs are important.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
That's your memories.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Somebody said to my daughter the other day,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
I like that if your house got fire, what would you take?

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
She goes, my albums.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
So it's a memory.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
It's a memory.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
And when you look back, I like looking back at all the photographs.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
It's a memory.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Is there anything you'd like to share?

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
I don't have much of a talk.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Thank you very much.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
I'm sorry.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
I didn't say that after you just shared this amazing information.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Thank you very much.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
I'll get this now.
