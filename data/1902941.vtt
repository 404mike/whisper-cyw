00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560
It's the 21st of June 2019 and I'm with Mrs. Elizabeth Lewis at her home in Rida.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.160
I've had a previous chat but we'll just continue a little bit more.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:22.080
Now Elizabeth, you grew up in Liverpool, Welsh parents, Welsh speaking, so how come you were

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.080
in Liverpool?

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.640
Why did you go there?

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.480
You know, why did your parents go to Liverpool?

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.400
Well, my father was brought up in Liverpool.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.720
His parents came from Anglesey so they brought up their children in Liverpool because he

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.120
came there to work as a builder.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.360
There was no work in Anglesey at the time so they'd be brought up in Liverpool but they

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.360
were all Welsh speaking.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.960
And your mum also, she lived in Liverpool?

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.560
She went there to work really because there was no work around here.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.120
Right, so Liverpool was a good meeting place as well as a good place to work then, yes.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.720
And can you remember what part of Liverpool you actually grew up in?

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.120
Waver tree.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.120
Waver tree.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.000
It was near Sefton Park really, it was between the two.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Right.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.480
It's lovely that you were speaking Welsh and English in Liverpool, yes.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.840
And then at a fairly early age you and your sister were evacuated to somewhere near Machynlleth.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.840
Yes.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.840
How did you feel about that?

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.320
Do you remember much about that?

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.120
I thought we were quite excited to begin with, like a holiday, wasn't it?

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.120
I see, well something comes out of everything.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.160
We like being in the country.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.360
I'm sure you did, yes.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.600
It was very much a farming community there at Llylodglyn, is that what you called it?

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.600
Yes.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.600
Llylodglyn.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.840
Small holdings and there were a couple of big farms as well.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.600
A very rural area I would imagine.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.960
Was that Montgomeryshire then?

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.960
Yes.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.960
Montgomeryshire, yes.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.520
And was much Welsh spoken in that area?

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.240
Yes, it was all Welsh really.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.240
All Welsh.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.720
You fitted in very nicely there, no language problems.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.040
And now it's all English.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.440
Things have changed haven't they, yes.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.000
So what sort of things did you do, you and your sister, when you were at the Llylodglyn

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
farm?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.920
Were you involved with any household chores?

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.880
We were out more than we were in really.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.480
We'd milk and feed the cows and clean out the pig and the hedges and things.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.160
Always getting sticks for the fire because there was no other way of heating anything.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.160
There was a wood near, we used to go up there and bring these branches down.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.280
We always had to be sawing sticks every evening or something.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.760
We weren't allowed to be sit idle.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.760
We had to be doing something.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.720
It certainly sounds as though you weren't.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.000
What about chores in the home, bread making etc.?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.120
Yes, it was mostly my mother's made the bread and tarts and that.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.000
And did you and your sister help with the bread making?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.520
Yes, we used to help.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.480
And then of course the other two sisters were three years younger.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.480
They were there as well.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.840
It was a lot of work really.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.080
I'm sure, so you must have used one of these old ovens.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.760
Yes, we had a big bread oven.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.800
Did you help with the kneading of it?

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.320
Well, we did sometimes, not always, but we knew how to do it.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.520
That's great.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.520
Did you make anything else?

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.720
Jam, cheese, butter, anything like that?

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.720
Butter, yes.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.960
No, we didn't make cheese, we made butter.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.960
Is butter quite easy to make?

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.600
Yes, it is really.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.080
How long a process was that?

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.760
We were in a journey, it might take about 20 minutes or so.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.480
And then we got it into shape after.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.480
Right, so you must have had a very happy time there really.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.480
Yes, we did really.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.480
Although it was wartime.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.280
We like being on the farm, we were quite excited about that.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.800
You certainly make a change from Liverpool's.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.840
In fact they must have been really pleased in a way that you were there to be so useful.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.880
Around the place.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.880
It could be.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:18.880
When you came to live in Kevin Kaido, when you married Alan, what type of farm was Kevin Kaido?

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.880
A mixed farm really.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.880
Cattle and sheep.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.880
Did you have many people helping you on the farm?

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.880
There were always a couple of men on them, working there as well.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.920
Of course everything was so slow then, not like today, you pull a tractor and it whizzes around.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.920
Things do take a bit longer then I'm sure.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.920
What sort of building was it?

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.920
I've heard Kevin Kaido described it as a hall.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.920
Was it a very big, spacious place?

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.920
It wasn't really that big I don't think.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.920
The walls were so thick, deep, it looked bigger from the outside than when you went inside.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.960
Have you been there?

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.960
I have, yes.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.960
I do remember visiting you.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.960
A long time ago.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:08.960
Yes.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.960
Did you have many outhouses at all?

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.960
Yes, there were quite a few there.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.960
Not as many as now of course.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.960
How did your life on the farm change?

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.960
You said you probably didn't have very much in the way of mod cons to begin with.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
No, we didn't have electricity or anything like that.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
I remember as soon as we had electricity, about a year after I was married,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I had this whole world, I thought it was marvellous.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Everything was so much easier then it had been before.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
I'm sure, yes.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
I suppose shearing would have been a very busy time for you every year,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
something to look forward to.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
How many people were involved with that sort of thing?

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.040
Between 20 and 30 I would think, roughly.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.040
I did the hand shearing, it took quite a bit of time.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:05.040
It's wonderful to watch people shearing by hand, isn't it?

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.040
Of course you'd have to provide a meal for them, wouldn't you?

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.040
Yes, that's right.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.040
And cider.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.040
Cider, that sounds okay.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.040
Did you have your own press there?

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.040
We had a bottle of cider there.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.040
Did you make the cider?

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.040
No.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.080
No.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.080
Cider would be lovely, very thirst quenching, I'm sure.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.080
Right.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.080
Can you think of anything else that really was significant

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.080
in the way things changed in farming matters?

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.080
In the household?

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.080
Yeah, well, both really.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.080
In the household, electricity was the biggest thing,

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.080
wasn't washing the clothes and that.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.080
It was so much easier to have electricity.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.080
Before it was, I think, it was carbon gas and things like that,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.120
but it was pretty hopeless, really.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.120
You had to manage somehow.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.120
But everybody was the same.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.120
It's hard to imagine, really, isn't it?

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.120
Living without these things that we take.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.120
It would be quite cold in the winter without central heating.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.120
No central heating or anything.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.120
I'm sure, I'm sure.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.120
So now your son farms, of course, Kevin Kaido.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.120
How quickly does he get things like the shearing done?

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.120
All in a day now.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.120
All in a day, with much help?

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.160
Not a lot.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.160
It was just the two boys, Barry and my grandsons,

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.160
and Arlene, and one other boy.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160
That's all.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.160
Things have certainly changed, yes.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.160
And so your grandchildren now,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.160
they've become Welsh speakers, I would imagine.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.160
A lot of them have.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.160
There are two of them teaching Welsh,

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.160
teaching in Breda, through the medium of Welsh.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.160
And yet they hadn't been brought up Welsh.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.200
And the other one, she's in Carmarthen now, she's married,

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.200
she was teaching through the medium of Welsh.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.200
So it's surprising how they'd learn to just go to school.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.200
They didn't have it at home.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.200
Yes, things have certainly changed.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.200
It looks as though we've almost come full circle now with Welsh.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.200
But there's more Welsh rap now than ever, I think,

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.200
than we had before.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.200
I think so, everything has changed.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.200
Because a lot of it's all the speak Welsh now,

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.200
and it's only from going to school.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.240
They don't have it at home.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.240
So you're surprised at how much.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.240
They were singing in Welsh on Wednesday.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.240
Nursery children were in the...

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.240
What's the name?

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.240
The Maithrin, is it?

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.240
Some nursery, they were between one and four.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.240
They came to the drop-in,

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.240
which we have after the Lutsen Club.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.240
And they were all these little tuts,

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.240
and they were singing in Welsh.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.240
That is lovely, isn't it?

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.240
Yes, they were all full of beans.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.280
They were all very young, and that's when you learn it.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.280
All right, well, thank you very much for your time,

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.280
Elizabeth, and I'm sure we'll meet again for another chat.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.280
Thank you.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.280
Thank you.
