00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
Has the miners' strike changed your attitude to strike?

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.040
Oh, fundamentally.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.320
I mean, I was very wary about this strike before it started.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:23.200
You know, one of the most important elements of not just NUM history,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:31.600
but British labour history was, you know, where the great arguments that went on here,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.560
and Aberdare, and the Rhondda, and Maastig, across central South Wales in the first decade

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:47.360
of the 20th century, when the arguments were going on about syndicalism, and about whether or not

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.360
basically trade unions or organised workers could usurp the power of democratically elected governments.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.960
And I was steeped in all that.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:09.120
And to me, it was obvious that a democratically elected government with all the power of the state

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.640
will always beat you.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.480
And not a totalitarian government, by the way, as we saw in Tunisia this week.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.280
But a democratically elected government has got the legitimacy of the vote of the people.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.840
And you can believe you've got the best case in the world.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.800
You know, you can change things to a certain extent, but there was never a hope in hell that

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.640
we were going to be another Solidarno.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.400
Because, of course, the government in Whitehall wasn't the Polish Stalinist regime,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:54.000
or it wasn't Tchechesko, or it wasn't a totalitarian government.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.040
It was one that had been elected by a significant majority of the British people.
