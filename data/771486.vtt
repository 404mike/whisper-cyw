00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm sorry, I've got a few, a few left loose here.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And it's very old.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
They have four lots making on them, I suppose.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm going to see this, it used to grow a while.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
No, it was in the garden.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What used to happen on, um, jacking apple night then?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Halloween.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Oh, we had a marvellous night.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The boys were dressing girls clothes.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Oh, yeah.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Oh, all kinds of things.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
All dressed up, like a carnival.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Yeah.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And they used to come round, in stockings, they'd come round to the mariloui.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
What's the mariloui?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
A horse's head.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Oh, my.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You've heard of it?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Yeah, things were happening.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
They had them in Cornwall.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
They had mariloui.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And then they used to carry lights around with them.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And then they'd go to, some used to come in, and they'd have parapetries and sandwiches.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Although people had the door open, they did it.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And they'd go tap on the floor.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This is South Wales.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
South Wales, North Wales, no.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
North Wales is Christmas time.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
New Year's Eve.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Halloween in North Wales, nothing very much.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Lottery New Year's Eve in North Wales.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
You know what they used to do?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Take people's gates off.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And hide them.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And perhaps you'd live in 100, or next morning when you get up you were living in number 2, perhaps.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And then there was a search going round for the gates.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And they used to go to powerhouses.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And I'll tell you what they did in one powerhouse, and my father helped to do it.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
They had, to go to the dairy, there were two steps to go down.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
From the yard.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Two steps to go down.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And in the yard was a big waterbath.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And what they did, they rolled the waterbath,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and they'd pass these steps to the door to go to the dairy.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
They'd put the waterbath down to leave on the door.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And they rang, banged the door, and the farmer goes up to the garden, and as he went out,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
the waterbath chipped into the dairy.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And he fired off the garden.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I remember it happening.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I was about 7 years of age and my mother was furious with him.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
That means you were at this place.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
That would be 1905.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Yes.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
No doubt you were a life-borrowers, I think, at that time.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And you'd go to people's houses and they'd have a big tub full of water and full of apples,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and there was a little man hanging.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
It was a marvelous time.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And every session we'd go down the road with Mary-Louise singing.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Any kind of...

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
They had a special song in South Wales.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I don't know it.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
They had a special song for it.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
But in old Wales we always had it on New Year's Eve,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
around the Christmas time that week.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
All sorts of things were done.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I didn't go with my grandfather as we were curious.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
You know the red gate as you go in the drive?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Yes.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I remember that gate we found in the panthorne,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
across the way with the rabbit warren.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
We found there lots of things belonging to other people in the little heap.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
For sale.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
You would see the fun they had in the country.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
All customs rich.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And then, I thought, between Easter and Whitsun,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
there used to be a competition, singing.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And you village come to my...

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
There were three or four villages together.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And they would compete.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And from the school of...

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
When I got from the university,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
some of the musicians used to come along.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And they'd do a shooting case.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And then some band.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And then a harpist.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
A real awesome violin, you know.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And they would be clogged dancing.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
All sorts of things rich.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
When did this die out?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Or how did that die out?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
It hasn't died out in the country.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
It hasn't died out in the country.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And then that was...

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Then you were angry with them.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Your grandparents were on mainland.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
No, we were on the mainland and my grandparents were in Andorra City.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
But my father's family were up from...

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Go over a little bridge.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I told you my father told me there were some little boys playing on that bridge.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
There had been a king there years ago where the two just had a trowel.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
They were throwing.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
You know what it is?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
A village up to you lean over and go over a little stone bridge.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Well now my father's family were from there.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Farmers again.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And you can see in everything else,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and you look over the water to the other side,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
the bay can be seen.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Over the other side is where my father's family came from.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
By the Bay of Davies.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Oh, not young.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Not young.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Not the bay with the rocks covered in them down.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
No, no.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
That is the one that are also on the main dam.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Here is the one that are also on the main dam.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
The other side around us.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
He didn't care.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
What was the problem with the one that's covered in dam?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
My grandfather was here in the land.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Some time ago.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Yes, probably 1860.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
1850, 1850, 1860.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Well, you know, was it not...

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
He was with the school children.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Often up to that sort of...

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Was that the school children who did that sort of thing?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Oh, in your town?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Oh, yes.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
They have changed.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And you like it.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
I got you a tube.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
My grandmothers were there.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
They were still the bankers.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
The politicians, they just needed to appreciate.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
You know, I got a chair.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Oh, you're not carrying on.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
I got a chair with W.J. on it.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
My father did that.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
It was a little...

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Yes, that's one of...

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And he could do with you.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
You've got that in your house, haven't you?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
It's a little...

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
You like to have it, Steve?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
A little brown carver's chair.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
A little lounge chair.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
It's made by...

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
It's been made.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
It's handmade.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
It's handmade.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And the whole goodie kitchen chair.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I saw that being made.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Who brought it?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I was a little girl.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
I was six or seven years of age.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I was a little later in the family again.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And you still got that...

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
They were all tradespeople.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And you got the cow horn.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
No, my wife got it.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
It was a grandmothers' look.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Sorry, I gave this one out.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
It wasn't a cow horn.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
It was made out of the whole thing.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
It was made out of the whole...

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
It was a cow horn.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And afterwards I thought I should maybe give you...

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
The name was on it was the Choo Choo.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And it was Nell's grandmothers.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And my grandmothers.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And Stephen, I can always remember...

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Going to my family's...

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Dad went to South Wales to work.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Because he used to do...

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Before the quarries closed...

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And I can remember it...

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
He used to do sandals.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And all the horses here...

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
That was my grandfather.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Yes.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
That was my grand...

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
My grandfather.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And when the quarries closed, he went to South Wales to work with quarry brothers.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
But he didn't like the way they were doing it.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
So he went to work on the quarry and not repairing.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And that was just...

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
He was a sadler, to be very true.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And he always made old boots and shoes.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And you know when there's a sewing machine?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Yes.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
When Dad had a sewing machine of his own.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
You know, a big one.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Yes.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And my mother changed it for that one.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
That's what it was.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
They used hogs...

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Hogs and bristles for sewing.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Oh gosh!

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Stephen, it was interesting.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
We used to buy a bowl of something like cotton.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Now, can't tell you what a cotton was like.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
You couldn't pull it like that.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
It would break into pieces.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
How did you tell me that you were sure?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Linen.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
No, it wasn't linen.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
It was a kind of...

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
A plaques.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
A plaques.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
You could pull it a bit.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And you'd have a hook.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
On a door post.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
A door post.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And it put this stuff...

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
I've got six or seven strands of it.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Throw it on the wrist.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And move.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And then you'd have a piece of

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
cobblest wax.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And especially brown.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
What is cobblest wax?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Well, I couldn't tell you.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
There's plaques then.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And it's called cobblest wax.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
It's made of this

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and then it's a shoe.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Then we'd see

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
the gore.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Rub it against.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And in the end, you could

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
pull it and it would budge.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
It was a strong, strong, big...

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And when he got it long enough

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
to do it double-series,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
it was doubling up all the way up.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
It was a little bit every time.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
To this big, it might be.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And when he got it long enough,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
it would keep sizzling.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And he did this.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
He did this again.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
But he didn't touch the tip of the bristle.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Into the end of the...

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Into the end of this cotton, sir.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And a kind of a knot,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
a special kind of knot on the other end.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And then

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
when he starts a shoe,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
he'd say,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
no, he had the...

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
I forget what it's called.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I used to have it.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
There's so many different...

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Do you remember that

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
it had a thick handle to it

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and a little...

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
I think it was a name on the end.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
It was Bradle.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
He'd say, that is a shoe.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
It was for the upper end

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and for the nose.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Then what you do then,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
you put a bristle on the other end

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
so the bristle goes in the foot

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
to make sure the way it's on.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Because when you buy

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
expensive shoes and your hands

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
so you can see the stitching,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
have you ever noticed?

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
When my father could do that,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
that's what he used to do.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And I tell him something else that people don't know.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
When you buy leather,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
when you pull leather,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
a skin

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
for your work...

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
You need to buy a skin,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
a lovely cow's skin,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
always prepared for it.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
You would cut a pattern.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
You'd look at your shoe

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
and you'd pull the shoe and you'd cut a pattern.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And then you'd put it in a bucket of water.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Now you remember that.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And then

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
after a bit of talking

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
for about three or four hours,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
he'd hammer it.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And it started off quite thick.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And he'd hammer it until it was thin.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
And then he'd put it on

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
the shoe.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
This side he'd have

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
a special foot

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
made of wood.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
To this side he used to give a shoe.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
And he'd put that in his leg

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
and he'd hammer this

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
nail, this leather piece

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
onto that.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And after a while he'd put it round

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and round it all.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And he would hold grabs, he used to call them.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
They were called

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Brass Tyreids.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
And he made a brass.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
He used to make shoes

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
for the villagers.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
These are my friends working boots

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
in the village.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
They have a hot nail boot.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Just for the villagers

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
he didn't use to make any for the...

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Oh, he used to make

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
riding boots for the quality.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Very costly little tenner length house.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
For a pair of riding boots, that was expensive for most days.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Did he do any saddles?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
He had a little... he had a workshop.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
How short? Even workshop was in the village.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Did he do any saddles?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Yes, he could do the lots,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
he could do the lots.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And then of course he would put them down

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
in the quarry, he'd slow down his 50%.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
That's why he went to...

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
That's what it is today.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And this was

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
the time when they brought the army in

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
and the police into

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
North Wales.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Which you never hear about.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Now, I have got a book

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
that is in Welsh.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
When I come again, I'll bring it with me

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
and I will tell you

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
what it says.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
This man

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
lived in here a lot younger than my father

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
but he remembered it.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Because he was a boy

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
at the time when my father was a man,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
married.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And he was a... this man is a...

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
He was one of the

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
lecturer in the University of Angles.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Great socialist.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Now, was he a train driver?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
He sent me a book the other day

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
and it...

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Part of his work was in it

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
called Some Englishman,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Socialist.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
And this man speaks

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
about the time his father was in the

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
train. His dad went there,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
went from the quarry

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
to work the quarry.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And then

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
on the quarry.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
But he was...

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
He used to have skin,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
lovely black shoes. He was telling me how much he put the soles on.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
After his work was

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
sold, the sole was sold

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
on. He passed them into

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
a shoe. And I'll tell you

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
how the shoe was cut. It's a piece like that

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
and a split in the middle.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
So, half run...

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
I could cut the shoe...

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
See this?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
It's all the

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
fit and the back is cut like this.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
One piece.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
There's hold the brim.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Hold the brim.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
The stickiness.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And see then he put the inside

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
of the shoe, of the

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
right sole. And then

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
he made it

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
into little brass...

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Little brass fraddles.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Little brass tacks.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Little brass tacks.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
What did you used to call it?

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
There's a name in Welsh when I can't

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
tell you what it is in English.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Revers. Revers. Revers.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
That's my English name.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
That's English. But that's what they were called. Revers. Revers.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
But

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
you know you're saying that before you went to

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Aswells,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
the quarries, this was

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
the...

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
No, this was...

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Or Tendryn.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
It's fine.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
He said he basically

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
stoned people to death.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Have you got that book,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
One of the few women of Wales?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Yes you have.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
It's a piece from the Beal and Boat.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
There's a lot in it. There's a lot to be given out.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
If you ever heard

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
a story about the policeman

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
on a Sunday standing

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
on the behind wall? No.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
I saw it! Yeah, this is it.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
I must tell you this.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
I've got a lot to give you.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
There was a wall. Are you sure?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
There was a wall, see, about this height.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Like that.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
About six foot high. That way there was a garden.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Dr. Sreut of there.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Sreut of there.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Terrace of Moses.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
This was in

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Bethesda.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
That's on the feast.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
That's all I've got to say in Bethesda, isn't it?

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
A mile out of Bethesda.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Up on the mountain.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
And Stephen, now, you stand...

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
There was a quarter street going that way.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
The gardens of Dr.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Sreut coming level with his...

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
He was all in a hill.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
And the policeman was a Manchester

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
policeman. They brought the police in, did they?

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Oh, God, yes. Brought troops in.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
We had the army,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
the whole lot.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
And I had to give you ages to have a

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
two-south village. He was only about five years of age.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
He said,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
let me black legs, he said,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
in English. Black doors for the hour,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
we used to show. We kids used to do it.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
We were like the little Irish kids,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
rich.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
This was purely because of

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
the striking of the quarry. Oh, of course.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
And then Stephen was telling you,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
he was stuck underneath his what?

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
This, like this, see it?

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Surveying the world for the village,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
I wonder whether we were going to come out

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
because it was only...

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
It's a one-year tour and they're in 30th Street,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
they're over. It's only one street.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
And you can't run it inside streets.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Well, Steve,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
stupid, stupid.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
And we were on our front gate.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
You've seen a picture of Little Helms, where I was told to.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
We were in a front yard, watching

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
a train and me.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
And I think my grandfather was there.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
And

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
all of a sudden,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
these two men from

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
coming out of the house, they'd come from the garden

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
very slow,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
and they took the corking stone

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
off the top of this wall

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
and dropped it on the policeman's head

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
and he pulled it out.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Lady, that cold.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Not sure.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
I remember that ever so well.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
I remember it was...

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
You know, when my father was alive,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
he used to go over there, he used to be that little

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
man, and he used to go over all this

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
and he'd try to...

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
And what happened about it, did they ever

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
catch the people?

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
No, they didn't. Who had done it?

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Nobody's seen it.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
No, of course not.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
And then in Brest,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
the Victoria Arms

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
is called.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
It had a balcony

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
and an army officer

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
was leading the riot act.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Literally, the riot act?

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Oh, yes, the riot act was.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
There's a hell of a place in Brest

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
and all that for a child.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
My father was arrested.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
That's where we were all, George P. Puthole.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
My father was arrested

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
because on a Sunday morning like this,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
now, we've heard me talk...

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
They're really going to a garage, you and me

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
and Pete, Richard,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
and I asked if they knew a family

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
by the name of Hughes.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Oh, yes, that was one coming out of...

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Out of the Vista.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Yes.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
And I wanted to find out

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
they were my father's family.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
And they were cabinet makers

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
in the Vista, see, that's where they are.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
And he's the furniture, Steve,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
the chairs.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Chair, some applicants, you ever come see.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
And...

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
My father,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Adrian de Llandeguy, this is the other

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
side of the Vista.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
You know there was a wall

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
and a river.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Yes.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
And a bridge going up, there's a village there for Llandeguy

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
and it was a mortal village

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
built by Lord Henry, where all the

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
black clays lived, where all the fishers lived.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Well, anyway,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
there was a wedding

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
in this place, and

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
my father had been to

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Abba, which was another direction altogether.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
In Abba.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
With a guy by his face,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
and actually had been poaching.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
That's what he can do, but they haven't got anything.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Can't be like that.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
What were they poaching there?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Some man and a partridge had

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
actually been going and poaching, you see.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Who?

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
And, anyway,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
this wedding

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
was in Sinner.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
No, you have heard of a

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
person called Little Jane?

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
No.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
My auntie Jane's daughter? Yes.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Little Jane

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
was married and her husband was

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
part of the organiser of his church

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
apartment, so I heard that. See?

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
And there was a wedding here

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
on Sunday morning.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
One of the black clays was getting married

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
and he had a loan

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
and had a loan, carriage and pay,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
and a coachman

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
and a footman,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
and they were having a do in the castle.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
But somebody went in

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
and fired a gun.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
After carriage,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
after carriage and pay, and I

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
I'd put on a scrone up,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
I knew the man that it happened to, and his wife.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
And they were really little snouts,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
they didn't have something safety to them in

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
because they thought themselves rich.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
They were black clays, and nobody bothered

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
with them.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Well, anyway.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
What is as bad as that, if you were a black

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
clay, twenty years later, you'd be...

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
If you were a black clay, now I'd tell you

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
about black clays in the Ronda.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
I'd seen a man march through the street with a

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
white shirt on because he's a black clay.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
In Hermes Street.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
The men would just...

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Just shun the...

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Just take them to Coventry. Yes, yes.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
The whole family. He was march

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
through, and the family was shunned.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
And I was going to tell you,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
they shot at this carriage and pay,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
and I don't know whether the man was...

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
What happened?

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
But anyway, the police

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
were going around the village, wanting to find out

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
there were certain people, and they came to my mother

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
apparently, and he asked,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
the police asked, where is your husband?

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
And she said, he's out.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
And of course, they called it in.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Everybody that were out that

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
morning, and they were

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
quarreling from the po... and they were

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
strikers. They were arrested.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
They were put under arrest.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
My father was put under arrest.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
But I knew my grandfather got him out.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
And Lord George's

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
brother,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
William George, was

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
the solicitor in Bangor.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
And he was seen by my father and his

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
mates-off. Because they weren't

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
anywhere near, but they knew what was going to happen.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
That's why...

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
They were on the other side because they were

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
ringleaders. And they didn't

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
want the ringleaders to be caught.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Because my father could run

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
like a grey helmet, if you want to understand.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
I made a bunch of all these things.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Oh, they came so...

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Good Lord,

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
George, come to your father's house.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Well, of course he did.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Because we're trying to

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
mention years afterwards in the hotel in

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Kendrington Race, there was an election

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
on. And I'll tell you now, you know

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
the people who

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
owned Brownsea Islands

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Castle and that,

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
apparently, was in Liverpool.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Well, now, very suddenly, Lord

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Kendring George was sitting as a liberal

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
candidate for admission.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
And I was staying at the classroom

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
in the hotel and I worked there.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
And one of the

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
waitresses said to them,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
she can speak Welsh.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
We're going to have to speak Welsh together.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
And

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Nathan-Lord George turned around and she said,

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
I mean, well, picture can I?

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
And I said, yes.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
And she said, did they know what we were talking about?

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
And I said, yes.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
And she said, well, where are you from?

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
And I said, well, I said, my mother and father

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
now were in South Wales.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
And they said, well, I've been here

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
for a long time.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
And Lord George looked back and he said,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
will you look back?

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
He said, yes, yes.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Who were you then when I tried

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
to tell them?

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
And I told them about my

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
father being arrested

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
and he was got him locked in a fort

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
and he was locked.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
And he was left. He was always going to set him up.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
How old was Lord George then?

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
50?

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
William or C.N. Mann?

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
And then there's William again

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
in How I Come to Pleas William.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
I was in

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
the court of the care in 10th year though.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
I'm not sure if you can remember.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
It was early

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
in the

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
late 1920s

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
or 1938.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
And Donald

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Sattel just sent me an order

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
with a phone call

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
and I said,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
I'm going to set up a

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
table

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
with six guests

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
and

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
I'm going to get them to the clock.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
The rest of the people had their lives

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
on. I said, what clock?

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
I'm going to get a big table.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
And I said, it's old.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
And then

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
I went to the court for 50 and he said,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
I don't believe

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
in the deal

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
and I don't believe

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
in the others.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
So I thought we might as well

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
set him up.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
He said, go and get

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
the place.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Go and get it.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
I was six years ago.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
And all this

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
back to the time you met

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Lord George?

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
I said, I'm going to meet Ben

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
and I'm going to join in.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
They were having coffee.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
I said, come on, bring your cat.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
And then

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
I said,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Stephen,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
we live in the city.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Go to parties.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
His wife is a Norwegian.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Very, very nice.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
I said,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
I'll be waiting at the clock.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
And she said, it's my husband there yet.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
I said, I'll have a car to catch him.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
No, I'll be caught

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
in the same place.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
He said, yeah.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
If you can't, don't let him come home, will you?

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Because he'd only be in a fit condition

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
and when he would come in, I'd say,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
start the car, you'll need a car.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
I said, come on, sit down, have a cup of tea.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Was he like his father?

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
No, no.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
He was a real comedian.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
He was

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
full of pen.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
He was full. Although he was an MP

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
for Tedrosha, he wasn't.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
He enjoyed life.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
He enjoyed himself.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
And I said,

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
my mom is here, but I'm going to go to the gym.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Then I'm asleep.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Day number four.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Right.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
I can't go to the party stairs, I said.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
I'll hold you now and I'll take you off.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
And I took her to the

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
headquarter.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
She jumped into my hand.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
My friend here is not so very well.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Aren't you, sir?

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
She don't call me that.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
She swears at me.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
And I said, come on, John.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
I was taken to the number four bedroom.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
I went to bed, I took his shoes off.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
John is going to do his collar, take his tie off

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
and keep it by his hands.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
And we leave him there.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
He'll knock the door, and we'll clean the door.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
I never saw him

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
going in the morning. He'd have gone.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
And I'm at

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
12 o'clock.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
There was a shop called the Candy.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Did you ever see where they made handmade

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
chocolates?

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
There was a box full of chocolates and a five pound

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
note came over.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
In those days, a five pound note, they had to go

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
to 30 quid today, at least.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
That was again, a late 30 quid.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
I met some marvelous people.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
I met Sir John Simon,

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
the home secretary.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
And his wife.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
And his two daughters. And he's got a son.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
And Admiral

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
today

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
with a funny name.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
I can never remember his name.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
But in

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
year one,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
the quarries were closed.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Eventually,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
eventually, he broke the strike, didn't he?

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Oh, yes.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Just stalled people out.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
One night, my family told me

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
a thousand men

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
were in conquestation

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
going to various parts of the world to work.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
A lot went

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
to Pennsylvania.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Because there were quarries

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
and coal mines in Pennsylvania.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
A lot

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
went to Scranton.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Because there were steelworks there.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
You see now the industry was taken out of

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Wales.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
This crowd had

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
been only there.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
They had investments, haven't they, you see, Rich?

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
They found out

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
what was going on.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Because my father...

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
You know I got

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
on a manken piece, a little brass square

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
ahead of the house.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
It had something to do with building.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
And you know there's a chapel

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
in the village. I showed you that

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
my father's uncle was the man that built

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
that chapel.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
That is Carmel?

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Yes, Carmel in

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Cathernbury.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
And then Richelle

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:06.000
And they were all houses of David and just like how the sun could be hot, thought again,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
built a village there.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:14.000
So he built it and then he went bankrupt and he went to New Jersey.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:23.000
What's the only link between the quarries in the Testa on the Sloan side with the quarries

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000
on the far side?

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Handberist side.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
No, not handberist.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Yes, that's what the railway is.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Of course it is.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000
That's it.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000
They were all owned by?

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
No, they weren't.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000
They were owned by, ah, which head is the name?

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
I've got to give them a little swing, no.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Harry, Ducks and Pearls.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Ducks.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Michael, Michael Ducks.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Ducks and Pearls, they're still about now, yeah.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
They're the same family again.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
And they linked up, did they?

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
They linked up.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000
They linked up, yes.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Oh, yeah, so one didn't pay any more than the other one did.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Quite right.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
And then I'll tell you something else, no.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
You heard Lady Diana Maners?

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Yes.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
She was 90 the other day.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
That's right, but caught on a car accident.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000
That's right.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
Well, no, I'll tell you something else.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Her sister married Marcus Sandresi, who was the father of this blessing mother.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
I remember this meeting here on top of the tower.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Yes, yes.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000
And he said, the finest scenery in Wales here.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
I have been up here before, and I said, which maybe, maybe things.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
That's a bit of a...

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
It's a good bit of luck, but I've not seen anything of it.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Because my father was...

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
It was for free then, if you could pay.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
A penny.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000
But isn't it English?

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Scottish don't belong on square.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Those were the house customers.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
So it was free.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000
And it went to...

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
And I tell you, Harry, how I used to come to go there.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
My father...

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Now, I showed you in Canberra PG a little shop, and I said, my father had a cobbler shop there years ago.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Oh, yes, on the left-hand side.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
That's right.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Near Farnes Station.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
That's it.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Well, my father had a little shop there, went on for the whole nine years.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:18.000
And see Richard, that was a head, a lot of the quarry men from Campiades was free.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
You should go there.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
You should go there.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Campiades quarry men quiet.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Was he better off than the average quarryman?

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Oh, yes.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Oh, yes.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
You were basically, you were the...

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
About the second row in the bank.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000
That's it, that's it.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
No, the third, I don't know, the farmers were the...

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
No, the farmers would have been better off...

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
The calm laborers would have been worse off than the quarrymen.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
And then the quarrymen.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
And then the lower tradesmen, in a sense.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:53.000
And then the family would tell you how in the village, in the handicap, that in the

00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:01.000
nest they were represented of, they were the undertakers and cabinet makers of the village.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Now, you remember the old register that I sold?

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Yes.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Now that was made by them.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
That was even at the polling church.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Yes.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000
And then you know the Grand Palace, you don't remember the Grand Palace clock.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
I do remember the Grand Palace clock.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
The Grand Palace clock was at the back of the dresser.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000
And it was taken out to make a case for the clock.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Well, the clock...

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
That is why you had, at the back of the dresser, you had an ordinary cheap quarter worth.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000
That's right, that's right.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
It was impressive.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Coming across, look, in those days, even though people were very poor, when somebody died,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
you had to have, obviously, a very ornate funeral.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Oh, yes.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
So how did people pay for it?

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
They paid the money, but they...

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
I'll tell you what they made.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
No.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
This is something for you to remember, Stephen.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:55.000
If you might get this to really your career, when there was a funeral in the village, or

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
anywhere, out there would be a committee formed.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
They'd take our socials down.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000
But how does it really take care of it?

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:14.000
At the day of the funeral, Stephen, a man would sit outside the door with a dead person.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Because the whole village got involved.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
The whole village got involved.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:25.000
And he'd have a basin in front of it, a white cloth, had to be a white cloth on the table,

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
a basin on it, and a white cloth on the basin.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:35.000
And as you went, you passed, you put a couple of coffers in, you were shilling in, got your

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.000
six-pence in, and when the basin was full, it gave you to the dead person's life, or

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
to the dead person at the table, you know, and that.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:52.000
But, you know, you're saying that, like that, and literally they took you down to the family's

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
town.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Yes.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
The family really didn't get involved at all.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
No, no, no.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Not at all.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
Now, Irene Dramal, my mother had a trench in Hughes.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Her husband died in Abercannon, with pneumonia.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.000
And he drove from the south way to Begherie, back to the north way, from the south way,

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
and it didn't cost her a penny.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Why is that?

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Because we all corrected for it.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000
In the street?

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Right from the village to a couple of villages.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Oh, this is for you under South Wales.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
And I'll tell you something.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:35.000
My granny, Nell's mother, had a sister, Auntie Grace, who was serving long was the Captain

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Jones.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
I showed her his grave.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Yes, in Flanbigh, Keechie, Cherokee.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000
That's right.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
One coat, not one coat in the lot.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
No, but he was not down by a train.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
He went on a lever crossing, and he noticed him through.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
He was on a van, I forget the name, but it was called George.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Keechie, we used to be on the same boat.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
We were on the same boat, yes.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
We were on the same boat.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
One of his sons, I know, is a fine count of Cherokee, in Brady.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Or what?

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Or what?

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Triad.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Just want to tell you something.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:20.000
I can remember Auntie Grace saying, and now we're telling you when this happened, I can

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000
remember.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
I remember when the Captain was still there on the island, and the man was there, they

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
paid the undertaker and all his senses to kill him.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:35.000
And then they would go round to the city and see his family, all the money, and he figured

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
he made another collection in the clear of the lot.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
So they started from scratch.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.000
And the woman didn't have, there was no intention, she went on the...

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Parish.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000
On the parish.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000
What about now, before that death, what about births when a baby was born?

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000
There wasn't anything like that happening, no.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000
There was just, there was a lot of births.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Yes, a lot of children.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
A lot of children dying.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Yes.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
What about marriages?

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Haven't you got a couple that married?

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000
No.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000
That was a do.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.000
All the villages trimmed up and flags, you know, I think for a carnival, we were that.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:22.000
And everybody went, I can't remember my number, when you lay tables in a chapel, in

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
the Khamar Chapel history, there were a chapel people.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
And a big two worlds contributed to all the wedding reception.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Oh.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
And everybody went to their own house.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000
A house ready for them.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000
A house ready for them.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
How was that ready?

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000
It was ready to go quarry again.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000
It can be quarry committee.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
If all the houses were quarried, what happened then?

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
They were always empty houses.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000
Oh, I see.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
My grandfather, Richard Jones.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Did they actually buy their own houses?

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000
I can remember Stephen, my grandfather, Richard Jones.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Who would be rented out of it?

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Oh, they were rented houses, because they were all quarry houses, you hear it.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
I'll tell you something.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:14.000
My grandfather, as you know, father Richard Jones, came to that country during the living

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000
and he saw a whole row of cottages.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Everyone empty.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
And he wanted to open building walls.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
In having all those walls that were there now.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:34.000
And he went to the state agent in Pantagai and he said, how much do you want for those

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
20 houses?

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
So I think it was 20 houses.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
10 houses.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000
10 houses.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
2 pounds each, right, he said.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000
I only want the stone.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
The rest, he said, I want some size so you can have.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000
All great, so much.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
Because they're lovely, very interesting.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000
2 pounds each?

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
He got 2 pounds each for the stone and he cried away.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Because it took weeks and weeks and weeks.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000
What work year was this, roughly?

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000
2010.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000
What about, how much was the rent then?

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
How much was the rent then?

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Half a grand each.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
What is that?

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000
So you can easily pay for a house in 2 pounds per house.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Because the house we lived in was our own house.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
And my grandfather told me for 100 pounds, he gave me one to sell to Richard.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000
And you know the house.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
That was a lot of money.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
100 pounds, really considerate of 1939, 3,400.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
Anyway, it was villa time.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000
He didn't buy anything?

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Yes.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Perfect.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Come on.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
You can hardly believe this has happened.
