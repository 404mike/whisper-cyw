00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:36.500
Good morning. Everything has its beginning in thought. The invasion of Kuwait first began

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.620
in the mind of Saddam Hussein. And people everywhere have been horrified, and rightly

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.800
so, at the subsequent violence and terror and the dehumanizing atrocities inflicted

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:58.100
on the Kuwaiti people. And while we may remind ourselves that violence, murder, rape and

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.540
plunder occur in the towns and cities of Britain and America, even in peacetime, it makes the

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:14.540
agony of Kuwait no less horrifying. But no doubt it's also true that there were many

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:22.820
kindnesses shown by Iraqis to people in Kuwait. Some, not all, of the hostages who returned to

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:32.100
this country before Christmas had such favorable stories to tell. It's sometimes forgotten that

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:40.900
Jesus lived the whole of his life on this earth in an occupied country. He never experienced freedom

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:49.580
and independence from the rule and yoke of the occupying power. We know that power could be brutal

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.900
and ruthless, especially when its law and authority were questioned. We also know that

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:05.020
individual Romans could show considerable kindness and consideration to the Jewish people. Now the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:13.820
Jews were fervent nationalists. The presence of the Romans was not only an affront to their nation,

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:26.300
but also an insult to their God. It is then of interest how Jesus, a Jew, responded. What was

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:37.580
his thinking in this situation? Jesus advocated neither appeasement nor violence, but rather the

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:45.380
use of a positive spirit that would radically change the whole situation. If the Roman soldier

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:53.700
commands you to carry his kit for one mile, as the law entitled him to do, carry it for two miles.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:02.220
Many of his contemporaries advocated the overthrow of Rome by violence. We know that violence did

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.780
break out from time to time and that Jesus made enemies because he refused to be associated with

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:18.660
the terrorists. Less than a week before his crucifixion, he wept over Jerusalem, saying

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.420
that the way of violence could only bring about the destruction of the city and widespread misery

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:34.540
to its people. And all because, he said, you do not understand the things that make for peace.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:50.260
In 70 A.D., Jerusalem was destroyed. Have we yet learned the things that make for peace? Well,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.700
it's a thought.
