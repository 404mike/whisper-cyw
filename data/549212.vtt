Mae fy mwm yn cael ei gwerthfawr.

y llok i'w gilydd, nuclear prenwiad ym Remmysg ac ang верch.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:55.960
I went to Windsor Clive School first until I was 11, then I went to Herbert Thompson School,

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:04.960
failed the exam so I stayed in Herbert Thompson. I had great fun in there, it was great, I had a lot of friends there

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.960
and I do miss it, you know, miss my friends as well, but I do see them occasionally.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:23.960
So then I left there when I was 14, my mum got my friend and myself a job in Littlewoods working Saturdays in Cardiff.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:32.960
And I did the year there, finished school then at 15, I was called in the office in Littlewoods, I thought, oh I'm out,

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:41.960
but they wanted me to stay. But when I was working in the canty, the kitchen and tables, they wanted me to go down on the counters.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:49.960
So I said, yeah, they didn't give my friend a job, only me. So I worked on the counters then for about two years,

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:57.960
enjoyed that because you were meeting different people all the time. And we had a one time when Llyes Parker came,

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.960
and Davy Crockett, the real one, came to Littlewoods, but we weren't allowed to say anything.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:12.960
I'd seen him, but it was up to the other people to spot him and have a prize off him, you know, and that was exciting when that happened.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:20.960
But then we saw this old man used to come down on a Monday morning with one arm, as we thought,

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.960
but the other arm used to come out of his coat and take the biscuits and the sweets off the counters.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:34.960
They used to say to the bosses, leave him, we know what's going on, just leave him because he's put down an out thing, you know.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.960
But that was that, so I left there then.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:47.960
Before we go on, can I just ask you, were you sad to leave school, would you have liked to have stayed on?

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.960
No, I wanted to leave. I wanted to go out and earn money.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.960
Why was that?

00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:01.960
Well, we didn't have a lot of money. My mum and dad didn't have a lot of money, so I wanted to go out and pay my way to my mum.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:15.960
And yeah, I was happy when I got that job and it was great. I had loads of friends there in the Littlewoods,

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.960
and then I left there then and I went to the Yvanna.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.960
Right, so how old were you when you got to the Yvanna bakeries?

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:28.960
I must have been 18.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.960
Do you remember what year that was?

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:41.960
I was born in 1940, so that's 58, wouldn't it? It would be 58.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.960
I tried, I would have been there then, yeah, 58.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:51.960
And I never looked back from there. I had great fun. I had great fun there.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:08:02.960
One day the land went off for us to go for our break and the boy, John Trudgeon, always got up there first.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.960
So I thought, this day he's not getting up there first.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.960
So I tied his shoelaces to the table and he didn't know.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.960
And the hoot went off and off I went and he was, I can't move.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.960
I said, no, I know, I said, I'm getting first this time.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.960
So I got up there and I got my cup and see my doughnut.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.960
He said, I couldn't get a doughnut today. I said, it was your fault.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:31.960
Then we used to have a line, I was on the Mazapan counter at first, that's where it was then.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:37.960
No, I'm sorry, I was on the Dundee case, put the nets on when I first went.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.960
And, um.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.960
Do you remember how you got the job?

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.960
I went for an interview.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.960
Right, can you tell me something about that?

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.960
Well, when I went for the interview and, of course now.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:09:01.960
There was a nurse there as well and a few questions, you know, where did you work before and all this.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.960
Well, of course I'd only had one job before.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.960
So straight away, as soon as they asked me other questions, I said, right, the job was yours, start Monday.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.960
Do you remember your first day there? Do you remember that?

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.960
Yes.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.960
Can you describe that to me?

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:25.960
When I arrived there, it was a Monday and I thought, and there was another friend, Marian, started the same day as me.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:32.960
Well, we didn't know this. We went in on the Monday, they gave us our overalls out here, brings the children out to put them on.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:47.960
And, um, they brought us down onto the floor and, when I think about that job, went down on the floor and we were putting the cakes onto the trolleys, onto the racks.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:53.960
So that was great, but you had to be quick as you could miss them coming off of the conveyor belt.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:02.960
So, OK, I got on with that. So I was on after the weekend, Saturday morning we went in and he wanted us to do the Dundee cakes with my friend.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:12.960
So we didn't know this, we were there putting his nuts on now, 12 o'clock, 1 o'clock and my husband, well, my boyfriend then, was outside waiting for me.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:18.960
And it must have been about 4 o'clock and they took the charge on from upstairs, um, Josie Guy.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.960
What are you doing here? Putting nuts on?

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.960
She said, well, you're not supposed to be here now, you should have gone at 12 o'clock.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:37.960
I said, well, why didn't somebody tell us? I said, we knew, you know, we've only been here the week. Oh, she said, stop what you're doing, go and get your clock out and go.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.960
Did you get paid for those then?

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.960
Yes, I made sure I clocked out. So I got paid for that.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:54.960
Then, as the time was going by and I was getting more used to the job and I was on a machine then, putting the cakes on to slice them.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:02.960
But you had to put a big roll of paper on, but it had to be straight because there was a magic eye on the paper.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.960
And what's a magic eye?

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:11.960
It's just a mark on the paper which corresponds with the eye in the machine and that folds them right.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:16.960
If you haven't got it right, waste of time.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:21.960
So I always used to do mine and my friends and another one. And we did that.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.960
Did you get trained at all in a val?

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.960
No, we just put on a job and just got on with it.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.960
So you were straight in on the first day?

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.960
Straight in on a job straight away.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:47.960
And did that and I was put on the angel cake on the end of the conveyor belt to put them on to the rack.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.960
Of course, they were coming down thick and fast, weren't they?

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.960
So some was on the floor, some was on the rack.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.960
So they were in stitches with me.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.960
I said, stop the belt, stop everything. I said, we'll have to sweep up first.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.960
I said, tell you what I've done, I said they're on the floor.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.960
Right, OK. But I got used to it then, I could do it.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.960
But when you first go on there, it's difficult, I tell you.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.960
Because there's no space in between them.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.960
They're coming down behind each other.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.960
So anyway, I mastered that.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.960
So then they wanted me to go on the creamery.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.960
I thought, this is it now.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.960
So you put the cream on.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.960
So I thought, well I'd been watching the girl doing it, so I'm going to do it how she's done it.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:34.960
And I was doing OK, because you've got to get it so it doesn't go off the edge of the thing.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.960
Of course, you've got no space and you're like this all the time.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.960
It's coming down the conveyor belt, so you've got to be quick.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.960
So I mastered that.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:51.960
Then I had to go out doing the fruitcake.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.960
I was doing that.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.960
And then I would—

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.960
I was a little mad.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.960
When I think about then, there was Len Jones.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.960
And I'd forgotten the other one.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.960
They were the charge owners downstairs.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.960
Well, you're not supposed to wear rollers in your hair, right?

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.960
Well, on a Saturday, I used to come in with rollers in my hair.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.960
At the tribunal.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.960
And Josie Guy, the one up in the office, used to come down.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.960
So I'd be like, get them off.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.960
Oh, I'd forgotten. I said, OK.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.960
I'd go up and I'd take about three out.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.960
Why weren't you supposed to wear rollers?

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.960
Because they could go in the cake.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.960
You could lose one.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:33.960
Right?

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.960
So that was that.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.960
Then I'd come down now.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.960
I'd be late. Sometimes the bus would be late.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.960
So I'd creep down the stairs now and they're in the office, right?

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.960
They'd watch me on my machine.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.960
And I'd put a Madeira cake through.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:50.960
I said, come on, Kate.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.960
You want to eat some cake?

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.960
Now I've done some cake for our breakfast.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.960
And out comes the other two from the office.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.960
What time is this?

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.960
Oh, it's about eight o'clock.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.960
Why?

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.960
You're supposed to be here half past seven.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:07.960
Oh, I said, but the bus wasn't there for me.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.960
Right.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.960
I had the cake, I had the cake, I had the cake, I had the cake.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.960
So when they went upstairs then we all had a feast.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.960
I was, as I told you, the ringleader.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.960
But I'd been here about a year then.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.960
Yes.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.960
So tell me, there's a few things I wanted to ask you.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.960
You talked about the uniform.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.960
Did they supply it?

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.960
They supplied it and they washed them.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.960
And then we'd come in the next day, the next day.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.960
And you'd go in the office and you'd see what size you were.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.960
You'd just take them off.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.960
The turban she did herself.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.960
Right.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.960
So you weren't given a turban?

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.960
We were given one, but we washed it ourselves.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.960
Oh, I see.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.960
And describe the uniform for me.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.960
Colour and stuff like that.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.960
It was white.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:52.960
It was white.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:58.960
White with the buttons down and then you tied the belt round.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.960
Then the turban was white and you just tied it.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.960
All your hair had to be under.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.960
All your hair had to be under and very pretty.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.960
And the shoes you wear, whatever shoes you want then, you know.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.960
Because it didn't bother.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.960
But no...

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.960
Rings and things.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.960
No nail polish.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.960
No nail polish.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.960
So that was that.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.960
No nail polish, no rollers.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.960
Definitely no rollers, but I did do it.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.960
Because my friend used to do my hair then, lunchtime for me.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.960
So I'd get him in the rollers ready for her to do.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.960
But I was a devil.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:46.960
And this one day, now Len Jones, he said, right, he said,

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.960
You're not doing your job properly.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.960
Which I was, but he was messing about.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.960
He said, you're going in the washroom.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.960
Oh, okay.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.960
So I go to the washroom now.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.960
Well in there, there's all the foreign women working in there, right?

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.960
Well they haven't got a clue, a lot of English anyway.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.960
So what it is, they're washing all the tins in these great big tubs.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.960
So they show me what to do now, these things.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.960
So I was leaving the cleaners in and putting the dirty ones out.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:22.960
And I can see the boss laughing like hell outside this window.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:27.960
So, and they were going, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, like this.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.960
Oh, yeah, okay.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.960
And I still do it the other way.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.960
Right, come on, Doryn, out.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.960
And that was my way of getting out.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.960
So I go back on my own job then.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.960
So you said there were foreign workers.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.960
Where did they come from, the women?

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.960
Were they women?

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.960
Men and women.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.960
In the washroom.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:52.960
Yeah, yeah, they were like Pakistani ones and Indians and things like that, you know.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:57.960
So they did employ that type of people, but that's where they were down there.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:06.960
And then another time, right, you go in the fruit room.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:07.960
Right, off it goes.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:13.960
Now it goes in the fruit room now and there's a glass window, a little glass window.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.960
And then there was Chinese in there.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.960
So show me what to do.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:26.960
And you've got, they're putting the fruit in the two, what do you call them, hops.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.960
Like they come through an autoconveyor belt.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.960
And then they go into a big tub at the back.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.960
Well, you've got to take all the stalks off.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.960
Sometimes you get stalks that will come through the machine.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:46.960
I leave the stalks on and take the currents out.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.960
And I thought, this is great.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.960
No, no, no, no, no, they've stopped the machine.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.960
No, no, no.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.960
Oh, yeah, okay.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.960
Started back up.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.960
I'd let a few go through.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:17:59.960
Then I let the stalks go through them.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:03.960
Because they've got to go through the barrel again, haven't they?

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:04.960
It was wicked.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.960
Was that just to get out of doing those jokes?

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.960
No, just for the laugh.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.960
Because I knew they were watching me.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.960
Ah, right.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.960
So I'd come out to there then after about an hour, back onto my job.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.960
They said, you're a little soon, so are you.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:17.960
I said, why?

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.960
He said, you knew you were doing wrong.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:25.960
I said, well, don't put me in there then.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.960
So I'd go on with my other job.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:32.960
Then on a Saturday then, on a Friday and a Saturday, we'd be by the ovens.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.960
And as the cakes had come out of the ovens, put them onto the belt.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.960
No, somebody else was putting them onto the trays.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.960
We were just checking they were okay.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.960
We'd have a good sing song.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.960
We'd be singing away, enjoying ourselves.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.960
You know, it was actually great.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:52.960
So do you remember, was it the music, was it radio?

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:53.960
It was the radio.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.960
Do you remember what it was, what the programmes were?

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:00.960
Oh, gosh, it was all music programmes, so I couldn't tell you really what it was.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.960
No.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:07.960
Do you remember what the songs were?

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.960
Well, it was Lulu, there was The Beatles.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.960
No, not The Beatles.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.960
There was Manfred Mann.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.960
Oh, and I tell you, Frankie Vaughan.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.960
I used to love Frankie Vaughan.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.960
And lots of all the fifties it was.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.960
And did you know all the words?

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.960
I knew all the words then.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.960
I could sing along and I was brilliant.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.960
Brilliant.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.960
I can still, if a rebel comes on, I can sing it word to word.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.960
But when I get in my head, I can't.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:44.960
When I hear it on the, which I got on here, I know word to word.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.960
But, um.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.960
So did the music play all day?

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.960
Yeah, until we told them to turn it off.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:55.960
And then we'd say, right, we've had enough now, turn it off.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.960
But that was after a couple of hours.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.960
You know, we'd have our breaks come down and it'd still be on for us, you know.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.960
And then, um.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:10.960
So tell me, um, what, the smell of the factory, could you describe that to me?

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.960
It was, um, it was very cakey, obviously.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:18.960
It was, you can smell them being cooked like you would at home.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.960
You could smell the cakes being cooked and it was absolutely lovely.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.960
You didn't have to come home and change your clothes.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.960
Because it wasn't on your clothes, because you had the overalls.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:33.960
So, you know, it was great and your hair was covered, so you didn't have to wash your hair all the time.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.960
So was the smell nice?

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.960
Oh no, it was a lovely smell.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.960
Not too overpowering?

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.960
No, it made you feel hungry, really.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.960
As you know, because I was getting up the cakes.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:50.960
So tell me, you used to come to work then from Ely and you said about the bus.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:56.960
Were the buses, was it public transport or were they laid on by the company?

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:57.960
Public.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:05.960
You used to get off the bus every morning and get off at the bus station and walk over the bridge and under the bridge.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.960
So there you were then.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.960
And you'd do that at seven o'clock in the morning.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:14.960
And sometimes that bridge was, um, flooded.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:19.960
So you'd have to walk up and get off the railway and down the other side.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.960
And you had to be very quick.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.960
You know, there'd be a couple of us, I wouldn't do it on my own.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.960
And we used to do that.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.960
And, um...

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.960
So, you were supposed to be in work at half seven?

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:34.960
Yes.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.960
And so you clocked in, did you?

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.960
I used to clock in, so I'd lose the time, obviously, because I was late.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:46.960
But sometimes I'd work a bit over, because you were allowed to.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.960
But then very often they'd ask me to go in at six o'clock.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:57.960
And I used to be terrified because round there, there was always a lot of rapes in that street around that area.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.960
So I'd get off the bus now, and of course you've got to go under that bridge.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.960
My eyes are everywhere.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.960
So I did that a few times.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.960
And, um...

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.960
I thought, no more, I'm not doing that again.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.960
You know, it's okay if you live near, but I was too far.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.960
Why were you asked to go in at six o'clock?

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.960
Why would that be?

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.960
Because they would have so many orders.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.960
It was Marks and Spencer's we were working for.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.960
It was their cakes.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.960
And there's so many Marks and Spencer's, as you know.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.960
So we had to cater for all of them.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.960
So we'd have a big order in, and had to get it out.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.960
So there was lots of... I mean, what were your usual hours?

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.960
Half past seven, so, um...

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.960
I think it was five o'clock.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.960
That's pretty long anyway, isn't it?

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.960
Oh, it was long hours.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.960
We did have a quarter of an hour for break, morning and afternoon.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.960
And an hour for lunch.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.960
And that was it.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.960
And, um, but there was a chance for overtime, was there?

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.960
Always. There was always a chance for overtime if you wanted it.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.960
Which I did, because I was getting married.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.960
So it helped me, you know.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.960
Did they pay more for overtime, or was it...?

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:16.960
You used to get time and a half for the weekend, and only for the week.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.960
So I'd do a weekend if I could.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.960
Not a Sunday, a Saturday now.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.960
And a Saturday was overtime.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.960
Anytime.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:31.960
But we went in on a Saturday on the first day, not knowing we shouldn't have been there.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.960
Like fools.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.960
So, um, what were the wages like then?

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.960
Tell me what your wages were when you went there first.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.960
Oh my goodness now.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.960
I'd say about £5 or £5 something.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.960
About £7 something if you did overtime.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.960
Was that good?

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.960
It was good then, because you could do a lot with it.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.960
My mum used to have £2, and I'd have the rest.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.960
That was a lot of money then?

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.960
That was a lot of money.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.960
But I used to put it away, see, because of getting married, as I said.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:16.960
And, um, yeah, I think about £5, £7 if you worked overtime, sometimes, you know.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:20.960
Then when I got married, you went up again, then, see.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.960
Every year it sort of went up.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.960
Yeah.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.960
Inflation, you know.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.960
But, um, yeah, it was good, you know.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.960
Apart from putting it away, what else did you use to do with your money?

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.960
Um, I never used to drink.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.960
That was after my boyfriend.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.960
Um, we'd go out.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:48.960
Oh, we used to go to the Pavlovah dancing in Crantham, or the Cairnads in Cattays.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:56.960
Or then I used to go roller skating in Barry, or roller skating in Cattays.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.960
Down there.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.960
And that was what we used to do.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.960
Go down to the parks, go for walks, you know.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.960
So where was the Pavlovah in Cattays?

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:14.960
Do you know, um, oh, Radio Craft is a shop.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.960
Oh, yeah.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.960
At Tesco's.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.960
Well, where Tesco's is.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:21.960
Where Tesco's is.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.960
That's where it used to be up there, and you had to go upstairs to it.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:24.960
Oh, it was lovely.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.960
Boys went inside, girls the others.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.960
And sarsaparalla and coke for it to drink, you know.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:31.960
Oh, it was lovely.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.960
I used to love that, and driving away.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.960
I was going to say, what kind of music, so it was rock and roll?

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:37.960
Rock and roll, yeah.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.960
Do you remember any of the songs you used to dance to?

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.960
Oh, gosh, yeah.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.960
Well, yeah.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.960
Um, Treadin' the Dreamers.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:52.960
Actually, I'm trying to think of the boy that used to come there, aren't I?

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.960
Oh, goodness.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:56.960
Sheridan.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.960
Um, he's still going now, actually.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.960
Oh, God.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.960
Billy Sheridan.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.960
I know of something Sheridan.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:14.960
His name was, and he used to be the little band in there, like, you know, in the pub.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:15.960
We used to dance to.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:19.960
It wasn't records, it was live.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:20.960
A band, yeah.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.960
Yeah.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.960
Rock and roll band.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:23.960
Yeah.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:24.960
Tommy Sheridan?

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.960
He should have been.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:33.960
I know it's Sheridan, but I can't think of his first name.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.960
What about, um, Kennads?

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.960
Where was that in?

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.960
That was in, um, in Catays.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.960
Where was that in Catays?

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.960
I'm trying to think now, because we used to wait under the bridge,

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.960
but come over to Ely Bridge and wait on that bridge there,

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.960
and get the bus to take you to the Kennads.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.960
I'm trying to think where exactly that was.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.960
Oh, goodness.

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.960
It was on a corner, it was.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:03.960
It was only about three or four stops away from there,

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.960
and we'd all go there.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.960
There'd be a lot of us.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:13.960
And then you said you went roller skating in Badie.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.960
Do you remember where that was?

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:16.960
Yeah.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.960
Do you know where the C-Print is?

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.960
You've got the shops, you've got your grass, the road,

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.960
and the shops there.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.960
On the end, up the stairs, we used to go.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:27.960
Lovely.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:32.960
And then the other one was in Catays then, and that was down,

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.960
that was only a few stops away.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.960
Good, I just, I could find it now.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.960
Oh, we used to have some fun.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.960
Glad you could do them.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:43.960
Oh, yeah.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.960
I was never still, I was always on the go.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.960
You know, when I think about it now,

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.960
well, today you've got time to do it.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.960
But, you know, it was great.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.960
I enjoyed my youth thoroughly.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.960
Were you unionised in Ivana Bakeries?

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:00.960
No.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.960
Nobody a member of the union?

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.960
Do you remember any disputes there at all?

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.960
No, not what I would say.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.960
No, no.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.960
No.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.960
Was it a kind of, were they good employers then?

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.960
They were brilliant, absolutely brilliant.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.960
They looked after their staff.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:23.960
Like I said, every year we'd have a dinner and dance.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:24.960
And where was the dinner?

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.960
That was in the Angel Hotel.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.960
In the Angel Hotel.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.960
Every year, and it was beautiful.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.960
A meal put on for us.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:36.960
Dance after, we'd be there till about 12 o'clock.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:40.960
The coach'd take us home.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.960
So it was all set up.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.960
We used to look forward to that every year.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.960
You heard him, you dress, let's go.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.960
What about other social occasions?

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:58.960
Tell me about the, how many women and how many men worked in the Ivana?

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.960
More women than men.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.960
More women than men.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.960
But there was a lot of men as well because of the Evans.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.960
Because women didn't work on the Evans.

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:13.960
And upstairs then, they used to do the,

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:19.960
these were upstairs, oh they set the cakes.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.960
Like we did the slab cakes, they did the little cakes upstairs.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.960
They did the packing of them.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.960
These had come down from somewhere and they packed them.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:34.960
And they dared me one day to go down the slope.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:41.960
They had to send the stuff straight down and they used to go down along the conveyor belt.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.960
The conveyor belt to the rollers, to the drivers.

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.960
And they'd put them in the van.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.960
So there was this thing that it had to go through.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.960
If there was anything in it, it would ring.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:01.960
So then they dared me to go down there and into the loading bay.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.960
Don't dare to ring.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.960
So I did, I laid down on this thing.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.960
I went down there.

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.960
I'd forgotten about the rollers.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.960
So I went across the road, bump bump bump bump bump bump now.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.960
And who should be there was Max and Spencer.

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.960
There's two of them, there's only two little men there were.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.960
I'll always remember that.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.960
And they looked at me and I looked at them and I thought, that's it, I've got the sack.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.960
Well they were in stitches.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.960
They said, well, did you come down there?

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.960
I said, it's easy.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.960
I just laid back, just come down.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.960
They said, well, don't do it again.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.960
And I didn't.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:43.960
I used to really enjoy it.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.960
I had some good friends there.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.960
It was great.

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.960
So then I left to get married.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.960
I was just going to ask you before you go on to that.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.960
What about the camaraderie who said you had good friends there?

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.960
Did you used to go out with the girls as well?

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.960
Oh yes, yes, yes, I got with them.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.960
And then another friend then needed to do my hair.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.960
They didn't need a boyfriend.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.960
We used to make a foursome and go out.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.960
And it was great.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.960
So there was a good feeling?

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:11.960
Oh yes.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.960
You didn't mind getting up in the morning and going to work.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.960
Because you knew it was going to be fun.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.960
Your friends were there and whatever.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.960
It was never a dull day.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.960
I don't think so because I used to make it a good day.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.960
I mean, you know a lot of us like.

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:31.960
So the work was quite separate, was it between the men's work and the women's work?

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.960
No, because we had some men working with us.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.960
Like I said, I was on the Mazza plant thing at one time.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.960
And John Strudgen was there and he was outside and I was his side.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.960
So I tied his laces up so he couldn't get up there first.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:48.960
There was quite a few rounds of packing.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.960
You know, on the machines as well as myself.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.960
But there was more women than the men doing it.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.960
What was the relationship between the men and the women?

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.960
We all got on great.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.960
We all got on great.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.960
I mean, we used to go off for days, a load of us.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.960
Meet up in Barry.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.960
Meet up in other places, you know, Pothco.

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:15.960
We'd see you there at a certain time.

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.960
And there'd be about 12 of us.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:23.960
Did you go for trips from the factory kind of thing?

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.960
No, no, no.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.960
They never had any like that.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:33.960
Why do you think the men were the bakers?

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.960
Why did the men do the Evans?

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.960
I think it was a man's job then.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.960
It was more of a man's job than a woman's job.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.960
Because the stuff that came out there was very, very hot.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:49.960
If you worked by then, like I said, we did when it was coming out.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.960
And it was very, very hot.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.960
And you worked there in the summer.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:54.960
No.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.960
But they did that.

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.960
The women never did that part.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:02.960
Did they used to bake at a different time to you as well?

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:03.960
No.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.960
They were baking all day.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.960
They didn't bake in the middle of the night?

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:08.960
No, no.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.960
No, I don't think so.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.960
No, it was in the day.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.960
Because it was always baking when we were there.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:16.960
You know.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.960
But like I said, the men were great.

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.960
We used to get on with them, have a bit of fun, you know.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.960
Everything was clean fun.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.960
Those days.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.960
You could have a bit of fun with them and it was great.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.960
It was nice going at work in there.

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.960
Yeah.

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.960
What about holidays and things?

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.960
Did you have paid holidays?

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.960
Yes, we had a fortnight off.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:47.960
And I kept mine for when I got married.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.960
So you could choose?

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:50.960
Yeah.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.960
Oh yeah, you choose when you want it.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:53.960
Yeah.

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:58.960
And yeah, that's right.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.960
We used to choose our own holidays.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.960
After April, obviously.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.960
And go and tell them when you wanted.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.960
They'd book it in and say, yeah, that's okay.

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:14.960
And we'd go off and then come back two weeks later.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.960
So, you know, it was great.

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:17.960
No problem.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.960
What about holidays?

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:23.960
We used to do...

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.960
I think we saw the Monday off.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.960
No, I don't think we did.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.960
No, I don't think it was around then.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.960
You know, we had the bank holidays, but we...

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:42.960
Of course you got me now, haven't you?

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.960
I don't know, I should imagine we did.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.960
I can't think, now that we did or didn't.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.960
I'd say we must have had them off.

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:57.960
Because they were good to work for, so I should imagine we did.

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.960
I mean, Christmas time we didn't work, obviously.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.960
But it wasn't open.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:07.960
What about the facilities and the factories?

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.960
Were they okay? Were there conditions?

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:13.960
Yes, they had a sick room.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.960
We had a lovely canteen.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:20.960
You can buy food there if you wanted to or bring your own, it was up to you.

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.960
And you'd go there every Friday to collect your wages.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.960
You'd be there every Friday to collect your wages.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.960
A couple of goes at a time.

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:34.960
And yeah, it was lovely, you know.

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.960
Yeah, it was huge, absolutely huge.

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.960
I had my 21st birthday there.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:44.960
And my birthday was in April.

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:49.960
I was getting married in October, so my mum couldn't afford to do two parties.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.960
So I said, well, I'll get married then instead, you know.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:57.960
So, unknowing to me, I went in on my birthday.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:03.960
I was called up to the staff room.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.960
I thought, oh, what's happening?

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:09.960
When I got up there, there was a great big two-tier cake.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:13.960
Two brothers had made for me, because they knew I wasn't having anything.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.960
And a lot of presents up there for me.

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:20.960
And I thought I'd have to get a taxi home that day in balloons.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.960
So, you know, that was a really surprise.

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:25.960
I mean, that's how good they were, you know.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.960
Now when I left, I had a lot of stuff off them.

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.960
And when I left, they collected, you know.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.960
So it was really good.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.960
Apart from that, what were the perks at working there?

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.960
Could you buy cheap cakes?

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.960
Yes, yes.

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:44.960
Downstairs, you can buy them down there.

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.960
And, oh, half price probably.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.960
Half the price, maybe less again.

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.960
They had plenty then.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.960
They used to bring the stuff down from Ryska.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.960
I think they had it up in Ryska.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:02.960
So you can buy smaller cakes as well, like, you know, puddings and stuff.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.960
So we can do that.

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.960
So, you know, we had the perks that way.

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.960
So that was good.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.960
Besides what we had in between.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.960
So how long were you there altogether?

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:20.960
18, 19, 20, 21.

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.960
That was three years.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.960
Then I left and I got married.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:31.960
I think I didn't go back straight there.

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.960
Where did I go?

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:39.960
Oh, goodness.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:43.960
So you left to get married, did you?

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.960
Yes, in 1961.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.960
Yes.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.960
October 1961.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.960
So why did you leave when you got married then?

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:57.960
Is that what people did?

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.960
Oh, you're giving you notice in?

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:02.960
No, what I mean was you could have worked.

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.960
Oh, I could have carried on.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.960
Yeah, I could have carried on.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.960
But he didn't want me to work after we were married.

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.960
Right, I see.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.960
So I thought, well, hang on, that's right.

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.960
He didn't want me to work after we were married.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.960
He said, I'll keep it.

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.960
He was getting about £14 a week then.

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.960
And then we had our own house in Arl.

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.960
So that was in Lambrammy.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.960
It was a lovely house there.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.960
Were you sorry to leave though?

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.960
I was.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.960
I can't think what I did.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.960
Oh, I know what I did.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:39.960
My sister said, come and work with me in Lionites,

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:43.960
in Sanatorium Road down Canton.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.960
And that's where they make music boxes.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.960
All right.

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.960
Oh, God, I went down there.

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.960
Oh, what a place.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.960
It was horrible.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:55.960
And all I could smell was the glue.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:59.960
And I was there for about two months, if that.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.960
Maybe a little bit more.

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:03.960
And I thought, I can't stand this.

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:07.960
So I went out and I went down to Yvonne and asked her if I could have.

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.960
Yeah, perfect.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.960
Said yes, come back.

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:13.960
And I had my job back and I stayed there then

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.960
until another two years.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.960
Maybe.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.960
I think no.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.960
So what did you say to your husband then?

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.960
You said, oh, I've got, I mean, I'm just asking

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.960
because you left because he wanted you to leave.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.960
Yeah.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.960
But you went back to work, so.

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.960
He didn't mind then.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.960
He realised what he said was wrong because I was home on my own.

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:39.960
Right.

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.960
To no any children then.

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:45.960
And I went back to Yvonne then for about a year, year and a half,

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.960
something like that.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.960
I left there.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.960
Then I went to.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:55.960
Did you leave then because you were expecting?

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.960
No, that was at the cigar factory.

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.960
Oh, right, OK.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.960
Can I just ask you, before we leave the

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.960
Yvonne altogether,

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.960
what was the age of the women working there?

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.960
I mean, were they, were you all young?

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.960
All ages.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.960
Were they married?

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.960
Did they have children?

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.960
Yeah, they were married with children.

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.960
Some were young like myself.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.960
A lot of us, that's where we used to sit together.

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.960
Oh yeah, there was a lot.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.960
A lot of them.

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.960
A lot of them.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.960
We got on with the married women,

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.960
the married men,

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.960
the single men.

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.960
We all sort of clicked together.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.960
It was really, it was like a family, really.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.960
When you think, you know, when I think back on it.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.960
And then we all

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.960
hit it off.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.960
There was never no animosity there.

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.960
So why did you leave for the second time then?

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.960
I'm trying to think

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.960
why I left there.

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.960
Of course I've got

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.960
a shot on the brain now, haven't I?

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.960
I'm going to stop.

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.960
So,

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.960
why did you leave

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.960
the Yvonne?

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.960
Because my sister said she can

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.960
get a job for me in the Goaman

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.960
cinema with more money.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.960
Because I was

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.960
getting married.

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.960
I was married.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.960
Okay, so I

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.960
thought she got the job for me.

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.960
I packed in my job, went down there

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.960
and they said, no there's no job here, we haven't got any

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.960
jobs and we can't have two sisters

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.960
working together.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.960
Oh, why was that?

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:35.960
Sounds like a bit of an excuse

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.960
there. It was. There was jobs there

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.960
but they wouldn't give it, they said, because

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.960
you don't allow two sisters working together.

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:43.960
So I thought, oh right, so I'm out of

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.960
a job. Sorry and all that.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.960
Then I got a job in

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.960
Vaughan's Laundry.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.960
I was in there for a couple of months.

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.960
I went from there to another laundry

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.960
round the corner but can't remember

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.960
the name of it. I wasn't there

00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.960
long. I left there

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.960
and I went to the cigar

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.960
factory.

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.960
So can you tell me,

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.960
did you have to have an interview for the...

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.960
I had to have an interview to get into the cigar

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.960
factory.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:13.960
I think I worked there

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:15.960
about

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.960
a year, year and a half

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.960
and then I became pregnant.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.960
Okay, so should we

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.960
go back to just when you

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.960
first went there? Yeah, when I first went there

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.960
I

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:29.960
got the job

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.960
straight away.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.960
Started on the Monday.

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.960
That must have been

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.960
sixty

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.960
five

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.960
about sixty six

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:43.960
I would say.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.960
And

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.960
I turned up for work on the Monday.

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:51.960
I had to go into a training room

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.960
as they call it. Training what to do

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.960
on the machines. I was on

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:57.960
the end part of the machine that

00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.960
actually made the cigar.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.960
There was a girl on one end, she used to

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.960
put the, doesn't matter if there was a hole in the leaf

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:05.960
but there wasn't to be

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.960
a hole in the leaf in my side.

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.960
So

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:11.960
we were doing that.

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.960
So I wasn't in there long. I come out of that.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.960
Sally, can I ask you about that?

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.960
Why was it important there wasn't a

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.960
hole in the leaf?

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:21.960
Because you

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.960
because of selling it, if there was a hole

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.960
in it, it's

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.960
no good. But what happened

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.960
if there was a hole, the girl

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.960
used to come round, when we used to fill our hopper

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:33.960
up, she'd come round and take them and

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:35.960
check them and bring them back

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.960
if they had holes

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:39.960
in them. And then we'd redo

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.960
them. And then

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.960
start from scratch again.

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:45.960
So were they the leaves that wrapped

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.960
the cigar rather than? Yes.

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:49.960
You had a machine and you

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.960
stretched it on the machine.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.960
There was air coming up in the machine. Stretched

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:55.960
it on the machine and it would come

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:57.960
and cut it.

00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.960
Then it would slide along and wrap it.

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.960
Then it would go into the hopper.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.960
The hopper. Then it would fill up them.

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:05.960
Then you'd stop your machine then.

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:07.960
The girl would come and take them away, put another

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:09.960
hopper there, start again.

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.960
What's a hopper?

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.960
When you

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.960
come to the end

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.960
of wrapping

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.960
the cigars,

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.960
it goes into what they call a hopper.

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:23.960
It fills it up.

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:25.960
It starts from the bottom and it fills up.

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.960
There'd be a couple of hundred in there.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:29.960
They'd take that away then

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:31.960
and

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.960
sort them out and bring another

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.960
one and start again.

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:37.960
So is this what you did from day one?

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:39.960
From day one, yeah.

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:41.960
But they trained you for this?

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:43.960
They trained me for that and I came out to train and they put me on a machine.

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.960
I had a machine.

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.960
The more

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.960
you do, the more money

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.960
you got.

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.960
It was like piece work but it wasn't.

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:55.960
So if you can fill as many hoppers

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.960
as you can, you get more money.

00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.960
Of course there was a lot of them

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.960
being there a lot longer than me so they were getting

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.960
in a lot more than me.

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.960
But I was working my way up to it.

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:07.960
Do you remember what your wages were?

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:09.960
Like your basic wage

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.960
and stuff like that?

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.960
When you went there?

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:21.960
I could think about

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.960
£20, £30, something like that.

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:27.960
Let me think.

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.960
Hang on. That was in 66.

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.960
The wages weren't big then.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.960
I can't remember.

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.960
Because we had our house

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.960
and he was in about

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.960
£15 to £17. I'd say about £12, £12 to £15.

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.960
That's without overtime.

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.960
But I didn't work any overtime there.

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:55.960
Was that good money?

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.960
Well it was good money then because it went a long way.

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.960
But

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:03.960
now you couldn't do it obviously.

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.960
I'd come out of training.

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:07.960
I went on my own machine

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:09.960
doing fine.

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:11.960
I learned to do it fast

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:13.960
and the other girl on the other side had to go fast

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.960
and I had to keep up with her.

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:19.960
She'd put the leaf on her side

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.960
if he had a hole in it, but not a big hole.

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.960
It only had to be a little hole.

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:25.960
Then come over to me

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.960
and I would put

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.960
it would come over to me

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:31.960
and my leaf didn't have to have a hole.

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:33.960
It was a top leaf.

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.960
Then as I say it went into the hopper

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.960
then it got filled and that went.

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:39.960
You can fill about

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:41.960
ten of them a day.

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.960
If you're quick.

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.960
I think I used to get about nine.

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.960
So do you remember

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.960
what you were paid per hopper?

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:53.960
No, it didn't work like that.

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.960
It was just

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.960
if you

00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:59.960
the other girls were more faster than me

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.960
because it'd be no use.

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:03.960
I'd just come out of training

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.960
so I was building myself up.

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.960
Of course I'd become pregnant then.

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.960
After about a year I was there

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:15.960
and you were only allowed to work six and a half

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.960
months then. You couldn't work any

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:19.960
longer than that. Any job.

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:21.960
Any job.

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:23.960
So once you knew you were pregnant

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.960
yes? Yes, six and a half months

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.960
after that then you had to leave.

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:29.960
Any job you were in.

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:31.960
So what did that take you

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:33.960
up to?

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:35.960
That took me right up to about

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:37.960
sixty

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:39.960
sixty-eight. Sixty-seven.

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:41.960
Sixty-seven because I had

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:43.960
it in sixty-eight.

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:45.960
Right.

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:47.960
You told me

00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:49.960
about when you found you were pregnant.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:51.960
You had to go up to the

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.960
To get my

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:55.960
last wages. Yes. Upstairs.

00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.960
Yes.

00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:59.960
And wait outside this window

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.960
thing and then tell them you know

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.960
they give you your wages.

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.960
But then I was surprised when I went up there

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:07.960
how many people were pregnant.

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:09.960
All six and a half months as I was myself.

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:11.960
And

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.960
I'd seen

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.960
one of them in the hospital when I went in for mine.

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:17.960
She was having hers.

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.960
But I don't know where the others had theirs

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:21.960
too. Whether they were

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:23.960
later or earlier they had theirs I don't know.

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:25.960
So how many of you

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:27.960
worked in the

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.960
cigar factory? Oh gosh I wouldn't.

00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:31.960
There was quite a lot.

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:33.960
Because when I think when you used to finish

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.960
there'd be

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:37.960
coaches outside

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:39.960
buses sorry outside to take them to different

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.960
parts of Cardiff.

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:43.960
Some used to go off to

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:45.960
Pyneth, some

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:47.960
Barry, some Cardiff.

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.960
Were they paid by the company?

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:51.960
The buses? Yeah.

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:53.960
Oh I don't know because I never managed to get on one.

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:57.960
I don't even manage to get on one.

00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.960
I was always

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:01.960
getting out. See the ones that have been

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:03.960
using you out to do it.

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.960
Off the machine and out.

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:07.960
Well I'd be off the machine in and get my coat on

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:09.960
and take my stuff off and get my coat on.

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:11.960
The bus is gone. So I'd wait

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.960
for the normal bus to come up

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:15.960
then.

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.960
So people used to come, women used to

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:19.960
come from all around? Yeah. Up the valleys?

00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:21.960
Yeah and the valleys, yeah.

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.960
Yeah they'd come from there.

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.960
There was quite a lot.

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:27.960
There was a couple of hundred people working

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:29.960
there, easy downstairs and upstairs.

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.960
Quite a few.

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:33.960
And were they mainly women?

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:37.960
A lot of women but there was a lot of men

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:39.960
maintenance.

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:41.960
The machines.

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:43.960
But it was women on? It was mostly

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:45.960
on the machines. It was all women.

00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:47.960
Yeah. Yeah. And so they

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:49.960
were mainly women in the factory?

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:51.960
More women than men. Yeah. Yeah there was a lot

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:53.960
more women than men.

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.960
A lot more.

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:57.960
But I enjoyed it there. It was great but

00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.960
I enjoyed the Havana better.

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:01.960
Did you? Yeah.

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:03.960
I had more friends down there.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:05.960
Probably because I was down there longer than

00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:07.960
I was in the cigar factory.

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:09.960
And in the cigar factory we didn't have time

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:11.960
to mess around.

00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:13.960
It was a serious

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:15.960
job. Which fair enough that's great.

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:17.960
It was a really serious job.

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.960
So you went there, did your job

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.960
and that was it.

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:23.960
Clock off and home.

00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:25.960
Yeah when did you start work there?

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:27.960
You know what time in the morning?

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:31.960
About seven.

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:33.960
Same time. Yeah about five o'clock

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:35.960
again.

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.960
And then

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:39.960
What about breaks?

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:41.960
We had a break in the morning, a quarter of an hour

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:43.960
the same. And the afternoon.

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:45.960
And I think we had

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:47.960
three quarters an hour for lunch then.

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:49.960
In that one.

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:51.960
It wasn't long.

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:53.960
But some

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.960
people never used to go for the break.

00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:57.960
They'd have it downstairs when the

00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.960
supervisor wasn't looking.

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:01.960
And keep working.

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:03.960
To get more money.

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.960
I thought well I'm not doing that.

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:09.960
What about uni farm? Did you

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:11.960
have a uni farm there?

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.960
Or overall or something?

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:15.960
Yeah what was that like?

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.960
I think it was my own.

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:25.960
No hat.

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:27.960
Just overall over your clothes.

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:29.960
Yeah I'm sure it was my own colour.

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:31.960
The belt.

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:33.960
And that was given to you by the factory again?

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:35.960
Yeah. Did they used to watch them

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.960
again?

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:39.960
Yes.

00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:41.960
Yes they used to watch them.

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:47.960
Like I say this fella worked there

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:49.960
and he lived down the road from us.

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:51.960
Well across the other side of the road.

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:53.960
And he said well look I'll give you

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.960
and I can't think of

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:57.960
any now. He lived in every morning.

00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:59.960
We'd pay him

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:01.960
some petrol money. Yeah that's fine.

00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:03.960
And you can guarantee

00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:05.960
time would come and he wouldn't be down by the shops

00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:07.960
waiting for us. We'd go

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:09.960
and knock him up.

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.960
We'd be there now. We'd be late.

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:13.960
Well if you're late

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:15.960
it was very regimental. If you were late

00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:17.960
you were called, you were in the middle of

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:19.960
the floor

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:21.960
with the charge under

00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.960
the man. I've forgotten his name now. He was very

00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:25.960
strict.

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:27.960
Why are you late?

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:29.960
Well I couldn't put the blame on that fella all

00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:31.960
the time. Well I said the bus was late.

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:35.960
Oh right.

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:37.960
Same excuse.

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.960
Right you've lost your

00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:41.960
machine so you can go up by there

00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:43.960
and give them the leaves

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:45.960
when they need them. Or go

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:47.960
there and pack up that lot.

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:49.960
You know you're shoved anywhere.

00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:51.960
For the day.

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.960
And I used to hate that because I used to

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:55.960
love to be on my machine.

00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:57.960
You've lost your

00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.960
piecework as well did you? Yeah.

00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:01.960
For the day. Yeah. Yeah you wouldn't

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:03.960
get that then.

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:05.960
So you know I used to go mad

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:07.960
over that you know. I mean

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.960
it was alright for him. He wasn't on

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:11.960
that type of work so he was just the maintenance.

00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:13.960
So if he was late it didn't matter.

00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:15.960
But with us we lost our machines.

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:17.960
So it did to us

00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:19.960
so we lost out on a lot

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:21.960
because he was late a lot.

00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:23.960
So in the end I said right

00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:25.960
we're going on the bus. Of course I got pregnant

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:27.960
then so he said no he said

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.960
I'll bring you and take

00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:31.960
you back he said.

00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:33.960
Did he mend his ways time wise?

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:35.960
A little bit. A little bit.

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:37.960
Not a lot. I said I can't

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:39.960
rush around. I said no.

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:41.960
I've taken my time.

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:43.960
So be early. Be up by the shops.

00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:47.960
Once or twice he was.

00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:49.960
Were

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:51.960
were people unionised

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:53.960
in Havana?

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:55.960
I'm sure they were

00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:57.960
not the Havana. Oh sorry.

00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:59.960
I think they were in Freemans.

00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:01.960
I'm sure it was.

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:03.960
There was no dispute

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:05.960
when I was there though.

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:07.960
Were you a member of the union? No.

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:09.960
You could if you wanted to.

00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:11.960
Yes I see.

00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:13.960
Do you think

00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:15.960
they were good employers in Freemans?

00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:17.960
Oh yeah. I knew it was

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:19.960
a good job. Don't get me wrong.

00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:21.960
That's the type of job I would have liked if I was

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.960
younger. Like you know

00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:27.960
starting off and got into

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:29.960
it and I could work my way up.

00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:33.960
If you'd stayed there could you have

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:35.960
become a supervisor? Probably

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:37.960
because I did

00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:39.960
in the dry cleaners when I was in the Alford

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:41.960
dry cleaners I'd become a supervisor there.

00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:43.960
But it's awful hard to work

00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:45.960
with your friends and all of a sudden

00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:47.960
you become a

00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:49.960
supervisor and you've got to tell them what to

00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:51.960
do. Well I

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:53.960
had a good talk to them. I said

00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:55.960
if I tell you, you do it.

00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.960
And it was okay.

00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:59.960
They were good.

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:01.960
But with the

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.960
cigar factory

00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:07.960
I should have managed to be there quite a few

00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:09.960
years before you had a

00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:11.960
went up.

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:13.960
But then they had the cameras in

00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:15.960
this one too and they asked me to go in

00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:17.960
the change you know.

00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:23.960
What do you call it?

00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:25.960
Where you learn.

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:27.960
The training room.

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:29.960
If I'd go in there and

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:31.960
work on the machines when I film

00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:33.960
and I said yeah, there's

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:35.960
about four of us in there I think.

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:37.960
And we

00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:39.960
were working out asking us questions you know

00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:41.960
and the supervisor

00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:43.960
go slower.

00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:45.960
You're supposed to be training.

00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:47.960
Of course you get carried away.

00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:49.960
You're so used to going like this all the time.

00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:51.960
They're just supposed to go like that.

00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:53.960
I'm just like that.

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:55.960
And I couldn't do it. I did do it.

00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:57.960
But in between.

00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.960
But the cameras were there for about an hour or so.

00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:01.960
Maybe more than that.

00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:03.960
But I don't know where it went.

00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:07.960
Do you know

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:09.960
what they were filming?

00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:11.960
Were they filming a training video?

00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.960
It was just a training.

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:15.960
I should imagine a documentary

00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:17.960
on the training in the cigar factory.

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:19.960
But the cameras

00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:21.960
were rolling all the time.

00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:23.960
And do you remember what year

00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:25.960
that was?

00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:31.960
It's either 61

00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:33.960
or 60.

00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:35.960
1960 or 61.

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.960
No, no, no, no, no.

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:41.960
I had the baby then.

00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:43.960
I was just getting married then.

00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:45.960
No, I'm not now.

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:47.960
You said you were in the 90s.

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:49.960
I had the baby in...

00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:51.960
It could have been

00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:53.960
97 or 96.

00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:57.960
67 or 66.

00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:59.960
I don't know where I am.

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:03.960
So, do you know

00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:05.960
whether it was a BBC

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.960
film or?

00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:09.960
I don't know. See, because I was so busy

00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:11.960
doing it.

00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:13.960
I didn't have time to ask anybody.

00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:15.960
I knew they'd say they didn't know themselves.

00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:17.960
But they must know.

00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:19.960
But where it went, I really

00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:21.960
don't know.

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.960
I'd love to find it.

00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:25.960
I'd really love to find it. I don't know, I get around

00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:27.960
that now.

00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:29.960
I'd

00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:31.960
find it.

00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:33.960
Whether it's still going.

00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:37.960
If you find it, let me know.

00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:39.960
I will.

00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:41.960
So,

00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:43.960
so you...

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.960
Sorry.

00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:47.960
Oh, can I just ask you before

00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:49.960
you went off

00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:51.960
pregnant.

00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:53.960
What were the conditions like

00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:55.960
in the factory?

00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:57.960
Oh, they were good. They were good.

00:57:57.960 --> 00:57:59.960
There was no bother there.

00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:01.960
Did you have a canteen and things?

00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:03.960
Yeah, a lovely canteen.

00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:05.960
Yeah, we had that.

00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:07.960
And plenty of food.

00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:09.960
It was nice.

00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:11.960
It was lovely.

00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:13.960
And did I ask you

00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:15.960
this? You think they were good employers

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:17.960
then? They were, yeah.

00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:19.960
They looked after their staff.

00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:21.960
Would you say it was a happy workforce?

00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:23.960
Oh, yes. Yeah.

00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:25.960
It was because

00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:27.960
I mean, I would have liked to have been a bit

00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:29.960
longer to get to know them more.

00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:31.960
Could you

00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:33.960
speak when you were on the machine? Could you talk?

00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:35.960
Oh, yes. Yeah, we were talking.

00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:37.960
Yeah, you can talk to the next one as well.

00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:39.960
As long as you make sure you're

00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:41.960
not putting any holes

00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:43.960
in the stuff, you know, and you get

00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:45.960
so many out of a leaf.

00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:47.960
Sometimes you get six, sometimes you get seven,

00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:49.960
sometimes you get five. Depending

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:51.960
on the leaf you can put the leaf all

00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:53.960
shapes and get what you can

00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:55.960
out of it.

00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:57.960
What about music then? Did you used to? No.

00:58:57.960 --> 00:58:59.960
No music?

00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:01.960
I don't think so.

00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:03.960
Can't remember music.

00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:05.960
Yeah.

00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.960
What about the smell of the factory?

00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:09.960
Did it smell of tobacco?

00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:11.960
It did because when I came home I changed my clothes.

00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:13.960
And I'd

00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:15.960
have a shower or a bath, whatever it was

00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:17.960
then.

00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:19.960
And then when I was

00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:21.960
pregnant I couldn't stand the smell

00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:23.960
of it then. It was making

00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:25.960
me feel nauseated a lot.

00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.960
So I managed

00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:29.960
to stay there for the six and a half months

00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:31.960
and I was glad to go then for that reason.

00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:33.960
But

00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:35.960
other than that,

00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:37.960
it was great and it was clean.

00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:39.960
It was a clean place.

00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:41.960
Very clean.

00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:43.960
What about

00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:45.960
the perks of

00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.960
working there? I never smoked

00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:49.960
or I never bothered.

00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:51.960
I've been lucky with my husband, I never

00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:53.960
smoked.

00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:55.960
I never smoked, my children don't smoke.

00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:59.960
And I definitely wouldn't bring any

00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.960
cigarettes by them for anybody.

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.960
If they want to kill themselves they can do it to themselves.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.960
Even when I go to Spain

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.960
I won't bring any back.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.960
A lot of people

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.960
have asked me to bring tobacco or cigarettes back

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.960
for them. No.

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.960
Anything else brought that.

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.960
So did you, was that

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.960
it then when you left and had a

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.960
baby, you didn't go back to the

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.960
cigar factory? No.

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:27.960
The only time I went back to work was when

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:29.960
I had the three children

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.960
and we moved into

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:35.960
the bungalow from the house

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.960
that we had in our room and we bought a bungalow

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.960
on the Newport Road and

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.960
we wasn't there long and my husband

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.960
worked in the rover works then.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.960
They went on strike.

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:47.960
And they were on strike for

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.960
quite a couple of months.

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.960
So I thought, well I can't have this.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.960
So I got a job in the nursing home.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.960
Which was a couple of days

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.960
a couple of doors up from where I lived.

01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:59.960
So I worked there.

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.960
But in the meantime I'd

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.960
phoned the restaurant which was down the road.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.960
If there was any jobs

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:07.960
and there wasn't they said, well give me your phone number

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.960
and if something comes up we'll phone you.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.960
But I was in the nursing home for about

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:13.960
six months, the phone goes, there's

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.960
a job for me. So I thought,

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.960
oh right, okay.

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.960
So what I did, I had the two jobs. So I was

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:21.960
going up there a quarter to nine instead

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:23.960
of nine o'clock to the nursing home.

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.960
Finishing a quarter to twelve.

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.960
Running down the road

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:29.960
to start a twelve o'clock and my other job.

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.960
Finish here

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.960
about three or four o'clock.

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.960
Come back home, do a meal.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.960
And go back about

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.960
six o'clock then until about two o'clock

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:41.960
in the morning. And I'd be doing that.

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:43.960
For a couple of years.

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.960
And he

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.960
got his job back then so I gave up

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.960
the one job and I stayed in the restaurant.

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.960
For twenty-one years then.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.960
What about Elks

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.960
Biscuits? You told me.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.960
I was in there. I wasn't in there

01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.960
for long. I stayed about

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.960
eight months.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:03.960
And when did you work there?

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.960
That was

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.960
That was before

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:15.960
I got married.

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:17.960
Oh, it was before you got married?

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.960
No, no. Wait a minute now.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.960
Oh, yeah.

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.960
I'm sure it was.

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:27.960
Because I was getting

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.960
I was married.

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:31.960
I was married.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.960
Because I was thinking of the bus now.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.960
I was getting a bus to go to Llanrummy.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:37.960
Yeah, I was married.

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:39.960
So it must have been

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.960
when I finished the

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.960
Yrvanna then.

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.960
Between the Yrvanna and

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.960
the cigar factory. Yeah.

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.960
How did that compare to the Yrvanna?

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.960
Nothing.

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.960
The Yrvanna was the best.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:55.960
You didn't like Elks, did you?

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:57.960
No, no, I didn't like it at all.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:59.960
Was there mainly women

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:01.960
working there again? There was a lot of women

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.960
and a lot of men but one of the men was

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.960
very, very bitchy.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.960
Not to me, but to a lot of

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.960
the girls. But if he

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.960
started on me I would have,

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.960
you know, better

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.960
than that. No, I didn't like her.

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.960
Was it

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.960
the employers or was it

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:21.960
the conditions?

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:23.960
What happened, I fainted

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.960
up. We had to work

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.960
upstairs, up the,

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.960
it wasn't upstairs but the steps were to go up to work

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.960
on the top thing. And it was very,

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.960
very hot. It was a hot summer.

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.960
And

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:37.960
I fainted up there.

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.960
Well the girls decided to go on strike

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.960
because of

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.960
the heat up there. They shouldn't

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:45.960
go up there unless they give us something to drink or something.

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.960
Well,

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.960
if they did, the boss come down and

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.960
get back on your jobs. Get back

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.960
on your jobs and don't strike. You're not going on strike.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.960
Get back on. And they changed the way they went back on

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.960
their jobs. So nothing was

01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.960
done. And I think that's why I left.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.960
Yeah.

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.960
Yes. So it was really

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:05.960
bad conditions. That was bad.

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.960
That was bad. I did not like that at all.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.960
So I'd never go back

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:11.960
there. The only places

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:13.960
I'd go back really is,

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:15.960
well not now, but

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:17.960
at that time, was the Havana

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:19.960
or the Alfa drive

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.960
cleaners. That's

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.960
when I had a lot of friends and I

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.960
messed around a lot

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.960
in my jobs. You know,

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.960
it was great. It was great.

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:31.960
We all were knit family.

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:33.960
It was lovely.

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.960
In the both of them. And I still

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.960
see friends now

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.960
from both of them. Do you?

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.960
Yeah. Do you see

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.960
them quite regularly?

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.960
Do you go out with them?

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.960
No, not so much. I had my

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:49.960
70th birthday last year.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.960
Last year, three years ago now.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.960
And my

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.960
daughters dug up some of my friends.

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.960
And I

01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.960
didn't know. I thought I was going to my other

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:01.960
friends from my

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:03.960
other job.

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:05.960
35

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:07.960
years.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.960
And then I was doing a surprise party.

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:11.960
So I managed to get a card with 45

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:13.960
on on this day now.

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.960
So I knew it

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.960
was my birthday then,

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.960
that weekend.

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.960
And I thought, well, they were taking

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.960
me out on the Saturday. So they said,

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.960
no, they said, don't worry, we'll take you out on the Sunday.

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:27.960
So I bought two dresses.

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:29.960
One to go to my friends, and one

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.960
to go out with my family for

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:33.960
my birthday. Well,

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:35.960
I put the one that I

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.960
put the card and first on for the Saturday.

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:41.960
I guess down and out it was in a British

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.960
region in Rymni.

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.960
And I

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.960
thought, that's my friend

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:49.960
from church. What's she doing here?

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:51.960
I looked again at that.

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:53.960
That's my friend from

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:55.960
round the corner. What's she doing

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.960
here? She don't know the girl from the

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:01.960
home stores.

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.960
And I looked again.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.960
And my granddaughter came to us.

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.960
She said, what are you doing here, Rebecca?

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.960
And I looked and said, I don't see my brothers.

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.960
And I went, oh my God, I know what happened.

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:13.960
They did a surprise party and they were

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.960
all there. They all came round from the back.

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.960
Surprise, surprise. I thought, oh,

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:19.960
sugar. Oh.

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.960
That was a shock, not a surprise.

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.960
So she dug a lot of my friends up

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:25.960
and they were there as well. So that was great.

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.960
From the Ivana bakery. From the Ivana

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.960
and the Alfa. Right.

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.960
Right. Yeah.

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.960
So, and I can't even

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:35.960
find those photos.

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:37.960
Were you,

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.960
do you think any of the work you did

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.960
in manufacturing, was any of it dangerous?

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:45.960
Well, the Ivana could have been

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.960
because you're putting your hand in the

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.960
machine. And

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:51.960
if that went off, your hand is gone.

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.960
So you have to be very careful.

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.960
And then,

01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.960
Were you made aware of? I was.

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:01.960
Of health and safety, were you?

01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:03.960
Oh yes, yeah, yeah.

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.960
You're shown how to put them on.

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:07.960
And what to look for and

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.960
whatever. So that was okay.

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:13.960
Were you aware of anybody who had accidents

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:15.960
while you were working?

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.960
Yeah.

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:23.960
There's a good

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.960
lot of boy now. He had a finger cut

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.960
off in one of the machines.

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.960
And that's the only one I know.

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:33.960
I don't know where this girl or a boy

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.960
now because it wasn't where I was. It was a different

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.960
department. So,

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.960
only youngster

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.960
it was.

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.960
What happened then, do you know?

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.960
Well, I suppose they took it to thoughts.

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:47.960
They had to come back and find the other part of the

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.960
finger. They found that and

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.960
I think they put it back on.

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:53.960
But I thought, I'm glad she

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:55.960
wasn't by me because

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.960
they'd have to take two of us to the hospital.

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.960
But other than that, nothing

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:03.960
really bad.

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:05.960
Was she given any compensation?

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:07.960
I don't know. That I wouldn't have a clue about.

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:09.960
I should imagine she did.

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.960
I'm losing a finger

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.960
or part of a finger.

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:15.960
Yeah.

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.960
I suppose they did compensation

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.960
those days.

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.960
Yes.

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:25.960
Okay. I was just going to ask you then.

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:29.960
Did you

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:31.960
enjoy working in

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.960
the factories you worked in?

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.960
I loved them all.

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.960
I bought the Alps biscuits. That's the only one I didn't like.

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:39.960
I liked the laundries.

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.960
But it's not the type of

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.960
job I wanted to stay in.

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:45.960
You know?

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.960
Because I was getting electric shocks off the machines all the time.

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:49.960
So, that wasn't

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.960
for me. But I liked

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.960
the Alfa,

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:55.960
the dry cleaners,

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:57.960
the Alfa, the dry cleaners

01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.960
and

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.960
Havana.

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.960
Havana. And I worked in

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:05.960
Littlewoods. And Freemans?

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:07.960
Freemans.

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.960
They were my four best.

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:11.960
Why do you think that was though? Was it job

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.960
satisfaction? Or was it

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.960
the social interaction?

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:17.960
It was the social. Very friendly people

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:19.960
were working there. The bosses were great.

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:21.960
I mean, when I worked in the Alfa dry cleaners,

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:23.960
we had to go upstairs

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.960
and I was working.

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:27.960
I was what they call a spotter.

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.960
And as the clothes come up from

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.960
being washed come up,

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:33.960
there'd be marks on them. So I'd have a machine

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:35.960
to get the spotter.

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.960
There's about five of us on these machines.

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:39.960
Then,

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.960
they'd put music on for us

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.960
every day, downstairs.

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.960
Now, what do you want today?

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.960
Frankie Vaughan. You can have him.

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.960
I said, well, I want him again today.

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.960
Okay. This is for Doreen.

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.960
Right?

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.960
Then this is for so and so, and this is for so and so.

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:57.960
And they were great. They were great to work for.

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.960
Really great.

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.960
Well, I used to have some fun down there.

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:03.960
I'd put a Scotch skirt on there.

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.960
They'd come up as the little kids when

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:07.960
I was on the barrels

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.960
dancing over with this little skirt on.

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.960
And there's the two bosses watching me.

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:13.960
But

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.960
didn't take any notice. That was okay.

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:17.960
That's Doreen, Arise.

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.960
I used to have fun

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.960
whichever job I was in.

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:23.960
So, looking back now then,

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.960
how, you know, from

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:27.960
many years later, how do you feel about

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:29.960
the time you spent working in

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:31.960
factories?

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:33.960
I feel I'd like my time over again to do

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:35.960
it again. I would

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:37.960
really love to do it all again.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.960
Not the ones now. I don't like

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.960
the jobs I've had now. I like them.

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.960
But it's not as nice as I had

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:45.960
years ago.

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:47.960
I loved them. I loved every minute

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.960
of them. I was lucky to wake up in the

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:51.960
morning and think, I've got work today.

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:53.960
But the weekends, I'd think,

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:55.960
oh, what am I going to do with the weekends?

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.960
So we used to go off somewhere.

01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.960
You know. Better than that,

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.960
it was absolutely smashing.

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:03.960
Absolutely. And as I said,

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:05.960
if I could turn the clock back, I'd turn it back to

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.960
when I left school.

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:09.960
And start all over again.

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:11.960
But some of the jobs

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.960
I wouldn't go to. I just didn't stay longer than the others.

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:17.960
Yeah. Yeah. That's what I would do.

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.960
Yeah, it was absolutely

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:21.960
brilliant.

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:23.960
Thank you very much.
