00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.880
But I do remember the, well, antagonism, I suppose, is the thing, which I think lingered

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.420
for a long time in the thought of people being turned out of their homes to provide water

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:21.940
for an English city, was, it did make a lot of people, even people who weren't demonstrating

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.700
or anything like that, but I think it rankled.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:31.700
And it still does to a certain extent, because it's often a little joke, you know, the Ronde

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.700
is two valleys, and whichever one you live in, there are people in the other valley,

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.700
and there's always a little bit of a needle.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:47.700
And I used to work with a lady, still a good friend, from the other valley, the Ronde Valley,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.700
and she always used to say to me, I don't know, why are they bothered to do things in

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.700
the Ronde Valley? Why don't they just dam it, she used to say.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.700
And I'd say, you live in Comparque, that's an even smaller valley, I said, if anyone's

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.700
going to be damned, it's you.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.700
So there's a bit of a joke, but at the same time, obviously, people weren't, hadn't forgotten,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.700
you know, that's all.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.700
I remember it on the television, and I do remember the feelings of antagonism about it.
