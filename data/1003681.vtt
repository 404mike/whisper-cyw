00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.000
When every walk of my being, No change my heart shall fear,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And say which thoughts run by me, For nothing changes will.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Thus one day I'll pray, I'll be, My heart's a lonely way,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:09.000
But God is round about me, And can I be his slave.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:25.000
In my breast no more is shall walk, For yon command the ye,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:41.000
When every touch and touch my breast, A layer of holy green,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:56.000
The eyes of old friends come down, And turn the world with awe,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:14.000
The world, the world of the eyes, O heartless, heartless heart.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:30.000
By bestow more rest upon, O yes, the only King,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:46.000
At last the world's gone round, And with a last the King,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:03:01.000
The world, the world of the eyes, O heartless heartless heart.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:19.000
In my breast no more is shall walk, For yon command the ye.
