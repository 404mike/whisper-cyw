00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.640
There's an old man called Mississippi, That's the old man I don't like to be.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:40.640
What does he care if the world's got troubles? What does he care if the land ain't free?

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:55.640
That old man river, that old man river, He must know something, but don't say nothing,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:07.640
He just keeps rolling, he keeps on rolling along.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:20.640
He don't plant taters, he don't plant cotton, Them that plant them is soon forgotten,

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:31.640
But old man river, it just keeps rolling along.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:41.640
You and me, we sweat and strain, Body all aching and wracked with pain,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:57.640
Toat that barge and lift that bale, You show a little grit and you land in jail.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:15.640
But I keep laughing instead of crying, I must keep fighting until I'm dying,

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:34.640
And old man river, it just keeps rolling along.
