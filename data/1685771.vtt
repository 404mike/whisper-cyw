WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So I'll just...

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.200
Okay, it's recording.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.400
So I'll just say...

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.600
What's the date today?

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.800
Today is the 27th of July 2020

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.600
and I'm interviewing Mr. Michael...

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.000
Sammaltanis.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.200
Sammaltanis, okay.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.600
At the Athenian Tree restaurant.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.000
So, yeah, don't worry, nothing formal.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.200
So, yeah, talking about the dogs.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.200
When they were stealing ewes?

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.000
Yeah, well I was born in 68.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.600
Okay.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.200
Here.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.400
Born in St. David's Hospital to Greek parents.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.200
Fathers from Athens and my mother's from Corfu.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.200
Okay.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.400
I think we lived with my grandparents in Gloucester Street,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.200
which is in Riverside,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.600
until I was about...

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.600
It was a long...

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.000
We got here until I was about three years old or four.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.600
Then we moved to Rumney in Canada.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.600
But I was constantly...

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.600
My grandparents, you know, especially being Greek.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.000
Yes.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.800
That was my mother's parents who lived in Canada.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.800
Yeah.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.000
So I would imagine that you wouldn't remember a lot from Riverside.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
No.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.400
But growing up, do you know if there were many people living down there,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.200
near the dogs like Peter?

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.200
We had cousins and that who lived all in Grangetown, that area.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.200
Okay.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.200
A couple down the docks.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.200
Yeah, you know, a lot of Greek.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.200
When we were small, we'd go to, obviously, cousins and all the other Greek community,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.200
because my parents were Greek.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.200
So we had to tag along to the old Greek.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.200
Yeah.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.200
We're basically just collecting information from people like you,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.200
anyone we can find now,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.200
to see if they remember of any names of people who used to work at the docks

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.200
or had to do any job relating to ships.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.200
Well, my godfather was a captain of oil tankers.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.200
He lived here with us.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.200
Would you mind saying the name?

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.200
Yorgos Papadopoulos.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.200
He's from Athens, originally, Palatria.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.200
And he was really good friends with my father,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.200
so he was my godfather,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.200
and I got christened in the Greek church in Grangetown.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.200
Oh, here? Okay.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.200
Yeah.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.200
Unfortunately, he didn't pay the priest.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.200
He ran off before he had to pay the priest.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.200
So everyone else had to pay.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.200
I'll throw that in.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.200
That's okay.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.200
He'd be gone for six months.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.200
He'd go everywhere, in Venice, Wales.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.200
He had big oil tankers and cargo ships.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.200
He was captain of them.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.200
He was captain of a cruise, as well.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.200
No.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.200
So he'd be gone for six months,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.200
and then he'd come back and we'd go to the docks to pick him up.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.200
We'd get on the boat.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.200
He'd show us all this, which was huge anyway, but he was small.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.200
It was huge.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.200
And then he'd stay with us for six months,

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.200
and then he'd have six months on.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.200
Obviously, they'd paid him too much money,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.200
and then he'd have six months off, and then he'd go again.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.200
And he'd always go from Cardiff.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.200
Once or twice, they'd fold him and say,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.200
there's a ship in Southampton for him to take.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.200
Mostly.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.200
As far as I can remember, until I was 16,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.200
from the time of old five, he was back in four, you know.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.200
He's the only person I really know, Greek-wise anyway,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.200
who had anything to do with carnivores.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.200
That's interesting to know of some people,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.200
because we're trying to see,

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.200
not just for people who worked at the docks,

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.200
but in general for the community,

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.200
we're trying to find out where people came from, originally.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.200
So we've talked to people who have come from Corfu, Saint-Ã‰tienne.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:15.200
Here, if you look, I've got original receipts,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.200
which I've framed, which was found in a skip.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.200
And they were all Greek companies,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.200
and they were all set in...

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.200
And they all didn't date. 1941, Vredos, they did.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.200
We've got 42...

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.200
And there was even a guy who was buying it.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.200
All shipping versions were Greek. Most of them were Greek.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.200
So we've got...

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.200
Oh, that's interesting.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.200
Yeah, so we've got plenty.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.200
I think I've seen something like that.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.200
Yeah, I gave it to him.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.200
And all this was found in a skip.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.200
Yeah, would you mind if at some point,

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.200
if we got to bring it, probably have a real free...

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.200
No, no, take it, you're welcome to.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.200
So, especially even more than the one in the Hellenic.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.200
So you see the name there?

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.200
Yes, yes.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.200
Emdriolis, is it?

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.200
Yeah, but they were...

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.200
Yeah, since the month of the Hellenic Emdriolos.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.200
So we're trying to, you know, very...

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.200
Yeah, they were all...

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.200
The Greeks had a lot to do with the docks.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.200
At one stage, during the war, and just up until the 60s,

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:30.200
the shipping merchants who were selling supplies to the ships were Greek,

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.200
or Greek Syrians.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:38.200
That was just someone walking past a skip.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.200
I've seen them pass the guidance, and it all took it with Florida Way,

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.200
and inside was hundreds of original invoices.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.200
I've still got a lot left.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.200
And while I'm going to do that, I'm going to get a bit of time,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.200
and we'll give them to the British Maritime Museum.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.200
Because it's something that's been going on free-war and after-war,

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.200
and you can see the difference in what I've looked through them.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.200
You can see the difference in what people were buying the ships from,

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.200
what we were coming in then, it was quiet.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.200
Yeah, you can see the different phases.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.200
That's very interesting.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.200
I think that's why he's back.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.200
He's in Greece now, but when he comes back in September,

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.200
he might want to take a look at these.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.200
Which brings me to the next question, because I was going to ask,

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.200
do you have any photos of that time when you were little,

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.200
or maybe from your parents' time?

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.200
I must have, at my mother's house.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.200
Yeah.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.200
To get her to take some embarrassing photographs.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.200
No, you don't have to.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.200
No, I will, I'll take some out.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.200
We got some.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.200
We got some in the 70s when we were at the house, we were in Runny.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.200
We've got loads of them.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.200
We're just wondering, we want to see if we can find anything

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.200
to show what life was at that time, or around that time.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.200
Any names that come to mind of other professions

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.200
that the Greeks were doing at that time?

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:07.200
Yeah, Mike Atopaldi, who was one of the best panel beater sprayers here.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.200
He was the best, he had to be the best.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.200
He taught everyone here how to be a professional paint sprayer

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.200
and paint coach builder, they called it then.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.200
Jimmy Exeteris, who's dead now sadly.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.200
Again, that was another place, he had an S&E Motors,

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.200
which was in Coltsdale Avenue, industrial estate, with his houses in now.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:35.200
He got taught from Mike Atopaldi, he was a friend of my father's,

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:41.200
and I remember going in as a kid, my father hardly spoke English anyway,

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.200
so he was just mixed with the Greeks, it was just easier.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.200
It was just easier, I don't know why, but Jimmy, Jimmy Exeteris,

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.200
his brother, of course, they had a little Greek cafe in Salisbury Road.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.200
And it was plenty of Greeks.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.200
Yeah, we're looking at any kind, some people have told us about the shop owners,

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:16.200
Propertis, Spiro the boy now, his son, he's my age,

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.200
he runs the Fintans chip shops, well that started by,

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:25.200
it was all top, I think they were called Top Gun, the chip shops first,

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.200
actually the one in Wychurch, which was the original chip shop,

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.200
still got that name, the rest are Fintans now, and he's grown it,

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.200
and they have their convenience stores in, I think it was Heath Road.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.200
So chip shops were all Greek or Italian when I was a kid?

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.200
I didn't know that.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:49.200
All the shops were, if you want fish and chips, it was either Greek or Italian,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:58.200
there was no, I mean City Road, Woodville Road, Cruz Road, it was all Greek.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.200
It was all Greek, like it's turning back now all Greek.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.200
Yes, it does, yeah.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.200
The Athenian nightclub, it was a nightclub,

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:18.200
we were at Leipzig in the 80s, late 70s and 80s, and you know Ollie, Ollie Bus,

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.200
he was a partner there, so you need to ask him about that.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.200
Okay, so I hadn't realised that he's been here for so long.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:32.200
Ollie was best friends with my uncle, my mother's brother who sadly passed away

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:37.200
about eight years ago, they were like that, like a married couple,

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.200
but they were a married couple, they were very good friends,

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.200
they had businesses together, so Ollie couldn't feel you in the morning.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.200
Ah, that's great.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.200
And he'll give you some really better mornings, and I know he's older than me.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.200
No, it's okay, we're just trying to start, looking for something to start with.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:59.200
That's very good, because I was going to ask if you have anyone else that you think could,

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.200
I don't know if your parents are...

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.200
My parents, my mother probably do it, you'd have to go and see her,

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.200
because she's old now, she's 80, and she's broke her hip,

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.200
so if you have, you could go up and see her, I'll speak to her.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.200
If you wouldn't mind asking, I mean at the moment, if she's worried about me,

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.200
we can leave it until later.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:24.200
She's been in all through it, we didn't let him out, we locked him in, me and my brothers.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.200
I've got two brothers, Christopher and Spero, older than me,

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.200
I'm the youngest out of the three.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.200
Okay.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:37.200
One's an engineer, and the other one had a barring call from until recently.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:45.200
Okay, right. Yeah, basically that's all, just asking for general information.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.200
I'll let my mother know, she'll be happy for you to go up there.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.200
Okay, that's great.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.200
I'm afraid you were food, but she'll be happy.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.200
Oh, we wouldn't mind.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.200
She could really tell you more.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.200
My father had a business when we were young.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:04.200
He had a business, first of all, with my uncle, who sadly passed away at the time,

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.200
selling fish to all chip shops, mainly all Greek and Italian.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.200
So he was a provider.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.200
Yeah, and then when that, because we used to go up with him,

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:18.200
like 50 miles an hour to Grimsby, which is like eight hours away,

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.200
when you drive 50 miles an hour in an old shaky truck.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.200
And then when my uncle died, he started doing the pita bread,

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.200
but obviously wasn't the pita square,

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:30.200
but the pita bread you buy in test schools,

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.200
the kebab houses, you know what Simo does?

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.200
My father did that, mobile.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.200
He'd done that for years.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.200
Oh, so you didn't have a shop where people would go?

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.200
No, no, he extended the house, and the house was full of freezers,

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.200
you know, for all the stock, AES, anything Greek, Latvia.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.200
So you basically worked for him.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.200
I worked for him, yeah.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.200
And then I had to go, you know, you can work for your parents,

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.200
it's very hard.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.200
Yeah.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:01.200
And I never went to, you know, my brothers did.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.200
I just wanted to escape.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.200
I wanted to go to Greece as soon as I was old enough,

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.200
because we spent every, you know, we spent two months a year,

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.200
from as far as I remember, we always went to Athens.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:18.200
So then when I was 17, I left, and I didn't come back until I was 25.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.200
Okay.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.200
So I went DJing all around Europe, a lot of Greek islands.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.200
Then my father then decided it was a good idea to open a nightclub

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:33.200
in Sanderini in 1988, I think it was.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.200
I was about 19, 20 then.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.200
After the year, I just said, again, you can work for your father,

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.200
especially not in a nightclub.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.200
So I left and went to Corfu, and worked there for two seasons.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:50.200
And then I went to Athens and worked in a club called the Hamam,

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:55.200
which was owned by a good friend of my father's, whose father was Turkish,

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.200
but was born here, and his mother was Greek, Paraskevas.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.200
And now he's got a beautiful, one of the best seafood restaurants

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.200
in Sanderini, because his wife was from there.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:13.200
So yeah, so then I did that, and then I went to Italy in the winter, in Milan.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.200
DJ there, then I go back to work, I worked in Crete.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.200
How come you came back?

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.200
Well, I came back then, you know, it was time.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.200
I suppose the family's here.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.200
24, 25.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.200
It's old for the DJ then, you know, you've got a little,

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.200
it's like a footballer, you've got a 10-year span.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.200
I made some good money out of it, I came back, I left the garage,

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.200
which I've still got.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.200
And then, fortunately, I got involved with my friends,

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.200
and opened a restaurant.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.200
We opened it in late November, and it went really well,

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.200
and then the story goes, everyone knows what the story is.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.200
So yeah.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.200
It was a hard year anyway, but you tried it.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.200
Yeah, we tried it, and we're still going.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.200
Just about.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.200
Okay, thank you very much for that.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.200
You're welcome.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.200
Thank you.
