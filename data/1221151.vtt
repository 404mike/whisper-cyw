In the early day when I first came here we used to go to the clubs in Cardiff and I had a mohair suit.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Well they didn't know what a mohair suit was.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Three button mohair suit with a split in the back. Jack the Lad. That was my personality.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Handmade. They used to have all my suits made. Never went anywhere to buy them off the peg.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And we were like a little bit out of the ordinary here.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And it was easy peasy with all the girls because we were so different.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Me and a couple of the boys that worked with me.
