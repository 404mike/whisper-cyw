00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
We used to go down to the Celtic deep in the late 80s, early 90s, and no one else was,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.680
you know, just a few fishing boats were out there. And we saw a lot of sharks,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.920
we saw a lot of common dolphins, we saw some, I remember one day seeing a massive

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.640
breach of some animal, but we never actually got to it. Something

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.200
possibly like a, you know, a humpback breaching. It was a big animal breached, a long, but it was

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:38.560
in the far distance. I almost had his name, and his name used to come regularly where there's been

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.560
groups. And we were all sitting all over the Sault Lair, we'd stopped for lunch, flat calm day,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.720
and we were all sitting all over the wheelhouse of the Sault Lair and all that, and we were all

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.560
lounging around on the front of the boat. And just me and this guy saw it, and we were all sitting

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.360
chatting, and just suddenly went, did you see that? And he said, and he did, but nobody else on the

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.840
boat did. He said, yeah, I did, I did. And we steeped, jumped on the, you know, in the boat,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.840
fired up, headed over, headed over, headed over. And before I think we really got to that area,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.280
we bumped into some common dolphins, and so everybody was distracted.
