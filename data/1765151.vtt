WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
There we are Aunt May, I think we can start our interview now.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And the first thing I wanted to ask you about is to go over what you've told me other times

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
about the Welch people coming up to St. John River Valley and settling finally at Cardigan and up in York County.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Well, I contend you don't need to take that.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
No, that's okay.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I contend you, my folks belong to, came from Cardigan in Wales.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And they came to St. John of course by boat.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
When they got here, they went by boat as far as Sheffield.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
When they got out as far as Sheffield, they disembarked, but the boat didn't go any farther, I don't know.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:03.000
They started to walk to Fredericton, and it was late in the fall, and the only one who could talk to him was the school teacher.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Yes, the other spoke only Welsh.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Only Welsh, and so when the folks from Fredericton heard they were on their way,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000
some of them came down to meet them to see what their plans were, and all they could say to them was teacher, school teacher.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So he went, he hunted the school teacher up, and the school teacher told them that they were headed for Cardigan in York County.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Now Cardigan was nothing but woods and rocks.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I wonder if they knew that when they came out.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
No, they had, if they did, there must be a lot of rocks in Wales, because they picked out the rockies far by the country.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It could be they were deceived, you know, like the Danish people who went up to New Denmark.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Oh yes, I would be in surprise, yes.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
No one told them it was all virgin forest, and they'd have to clear up there.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Well anyway, it was so late in the fall, and there wasn't a house for them up there, that the Fredericton people wouldn't let them go at all.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
They would let them even think of going up there at that time of the year.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So they took them in, some of them took them into their homes, some of them, and the men folks got work.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
There was a man by the name of Saunders who started a little store, and that store, Saunders' ran for years and years.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
When I was a young girl, they were still there.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And some of them moved on up and eventually to Cardigan.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Well the men folks went up in the spring, and the women still stayed in Fredericton.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The men went up and they cut down trees, and they started and built a few log houses, and the women folks went up.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And they cleared a few bits of land and put a little crop in, and strived it out, I'd say.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Because there was no roadway except a dog path through the woods, and there they were.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Do you have any idea roughly what year this was when they arrived?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
No, I couldn't tell you the year, but I think you could find that out at the Orson Briggs Museum.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Now it was way back in the form of when my grandmother was there, I think she was born here.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
There'd be land office records too of the Grants.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
My father's name was Evans, John I think, John Evans.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And what our mother's name was I don't know.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Except that you said they didn't pronounce it that way.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
No, they called it Evans. They don't call it Evans, they called it Levens.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And in my youth they always called it Evans.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And I was, let me sit down over here.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Yes, perhaps I will.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
My cousins, Evans' cousins were called Evans.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
But when I named my son Evan, well, I don't know why Evan he is.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So anyway, my grandfather, his wife's name was Susan.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And he cut out a piece of land, cleared a piece of land and put up a house.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And they used to go to church in their bare feet.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Until they came to a certain rock below the greenhouse.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Of course one of the first things they did was put up a meeting house.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And when they came to that rock they carried their shoes.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
They put their shoes on there, went barefoot, saved the shoes.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And then they took them off and they went back to the rock and walked home with their bare feet.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
What denomination would they have been?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Well, it was Methodist. Methodist as it was years ago.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
There wasn't a Methodist church there because there still is a Methodist church there but they don't use it.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Methodists I guess were or became the predominant denomination in Wales, didn't they?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000
They used to have sing songs and use a tuning fork.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And I know my uncles by marriage learned how to sing from the tuning fork.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I'm sorry, maybe you said or did you say roughly how many colonists there were?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
No, but I can name you some of the families.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Saunders and Richards and Evans. There were two different tribes of Evans.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
There were the Redbens and the Blackbens. Mine were the Blackbens.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And there was, oh let me think, Williams and Thomases and Griffiths I think I had in there.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Yeah, Griffiths are two of the Mary Poppett sisters. Your next generation.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:52.000
There are quite a few other Welsh names around the Fredericton area. Joneses and there are other Morgans too of country.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Yes, Joneses up in that section.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Yes, no doubt some of them are descended from the Cardigan people too.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Oh yes, no doubt at all.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Anyway these people lived and managed to live, they used to have to go to Fredericton on foot.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And carry their supplies back on their backs.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:24.000
The women would take a basket of eggs and butter and walk 17 miles to Fredericton and cart home whatever they could get for their eggs and their butter.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
They used to do the same with New Merrill and the East North.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Yeah.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And one woman walked clear to Fredericton and back and two miles from home she had to go into her neighbor's to have a new baby.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Two days later her husband came with an ox cart and took her home.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And one day when my grandfather was out, her great grandfather, was out in the woods, a tree fell on him and killed him.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And my grandmother said they were so poor that they sometimes had to pull up the potatoes they planted to eat.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
They wouldn't have anything else they did, for they never had a chance to sprout.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
They'd have to dig them up and eat them.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And then grandmother married a man by the name of Jenkins.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Well that's a Welsh name too.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Yes, but he wasn't worth a hoot.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Was he from the colony too?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
He must have been up there.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
We always called her Granny Jenkins.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
I didn't know her, but father did.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And I was her special pet.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And she lived with my grandmother after Mr. Jenkins passed away in Stanley.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Yes, that's quite near Stanley, isn't it?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Yeah, about 10 or 12 miles out.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
I couldn't even find it on the map.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I went out through the hill here not long ago and couldn't find it myself.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
I think it's pretty well disappeared, hasn't it?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Well they changed the road and you wouldn't know it's the same country at all.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Because I know my aunt Ellen Griffiths lived there and I was there at different times.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Could I find that place? No sir.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000
So anyway, there's a few of them still. There was a Billy Ray that used to live there.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.000
But I think he was an English boy that came from one of those immigrant kids, you know, and he married one.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Could be.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
But there were several families of Griffiths up there.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Oh, do you have any idea what... well obviously they came from Cardigan's here in Wales, presumably, or they wouldn't have given that name to this place that they found it.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Yes, that's where they came from. And they named their little rocky country after Cardigan.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
So there must be rocks in Cardigan in Wales.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Well, did you say that you thought there were still a few homes there? The place wasn't completely abandoned?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Oh no, some of them I know because I think some of Uncle David Evans's family there.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And Uncle David Evans belonged to the Red Evans's and he married Papa's aunt.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
That's how he came to be, Uncle David.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And, oh, there was a lot of them out in Woodland and I do know some of their names but I've forgotten them.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
See, they spread.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Yes, yes.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And Woodland, Evans and Sir Woodland, Welsh people as well.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Yes.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And, oh, it never was, it never got to be a very big place, you know.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
No.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
But they seemed to be contented there.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:53.000
But the Baptist Church, while it's still there, or was last time I was there, has been, they haven't used it for a long while.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Dad's cousin had it all painted and re-shingled in the lake outside and fixed it up the best he could.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
But I went in and opened my name in there one day.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
People are visitors of visiting the book, you know.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
I suppose it's been a few years since you were there.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Oh, yes, for a long time ago.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
That's how I was married but it's a long time ago, just the same.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And the graveyard had all these old names.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000
You see, we were in there looking at some of the names of the people that were relatives of ours.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And that's how it came to be, into the Baptist Church, for some of our people were Baptist.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
But after the Baptist Church died down, it was the Mennedists that took over, you see.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Everybody went to the Mennedists Church.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Was it your mother or your grandmother you were saying was still, your grandmother still spoke Welsh, didn't you say?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And your mother knew some words?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Grandmother only had, she had spoken Welsh when she was young.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
She told me she had forgotten it all but one or two words.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And she just told me what they were and I don't know if I could say them right or not.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Weirs and gers, ends and ends.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.000
I remember I tried to find those words in a Welsh dictionary but it could be they were dialect words or something.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
I couldn't seem to find them, you know.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And then she had a name for a broom and I don't know what that was.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
For what?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
A broom.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.000
She didn't keep up with Welsh after she got married because grandfather spoke English, you see.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And I thought like your old granny talked Welsh but grandmother didn't.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Well that's really interesting.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I'll tell you, you were saying that your aunt...

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Elizabeth Wood, of course. She was on mother's side. She was a Welsh.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And she told you most of what you know about the Cardigan people?

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
She was very much interested in the history of the people around Frederty, you know.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And Uncle Wood was interested in the museum.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
In fact I think he started to say the only thing that said she never could keep anything in the house,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
she took everything in the museum, even the broom.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
And who else did you mention who showed you the...

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Grandmother showed me...

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Oh yes, your grandmother.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Grandmother Sansom.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
She showed me the place where they used to live, it was pretty well the road in,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
but all grown up again.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:37.000
The old place of course when grandmother Jenkins left it, well it just grew up in a bush.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Where nobody...

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I don't know, yes. Grandmother had brothers, there was Caleb and John and Benjamin.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
And that was another one known.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
I know one of them went to the stage.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
And I think Uncle Caleb lived down on the Royal Road.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
I never saw him, they used to call that Calip.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And that was called Caleb, it was called Calip.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
That would be more or less a Welsh pronunciation of it I think.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Oh yes, that was a Welsh pronunciation, he was Uncle Calip.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
That's interesting.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Yeah, and I think Ben lived somewhere down around...

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Possibly Nashville City or Gibson or something.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Somewhere down there I know he didn't live on the Royal Road so far as I know.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
That's where my father's people came from, the Sansoms.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
My grandfather Sansom was brought up on the Royal Road.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Of course he wasn't Welsh, he was English.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
From English descent.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
So there we are.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
You know Canadian people are...

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
They're only Canadians, there's no Sansom for them.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
You're English, you're Welsh, you're Dutch, you're anything else, you've got everything in you.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Irish and I've got Irish and I've got not so much Irish as Scottish Irish.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
And the Welsh.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And there's Dutch, mother's words, there were Dutch in mother's family.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:23.000
There were certain parts of the country where people didn't mix as much.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:32.000
I have a friend who was born in Cape Breton Island and he says he's traced both sides of his family right back to the Highlands of Scotland.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Yes.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
As far as he knows he's 100% Highlander.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
You'd only find that in a more remote area like Cape Breton.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
They flocked for themselves.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Did you know that a lot of them went down to New Zealand?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Yes they did.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
And some of them went over and settled in the Codray Valley in western Newfoundland too.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Closer to home.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000
They had a ministry that led a whole lot of them, it's flocked, down to New Zealand.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Yes.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
His name was McLean I think.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
I don't remember his name but I remember reading about him.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
I thought that was quite interesting.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Yes.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:56.000
There Aunt May, just to continue in a different vein, I was wondering if you could tell us what you know about the Durex or relations or cousins here.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Some of them are still living in the St. John area I believe.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Yes.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
There was Grandmother Hall was a Durex.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Yes.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
From down here and when she was about 12 or 13 she ran away from home.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:19.000
She had 14 different excuses for doing it and I think most of them were from right down to that were just to hear miserable devils and some of that.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
She just wanted to make trouble.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Is that so?

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:33.000
She said it was because there was some sort of an epidemic down here but she skinned up a river on the boat, the river boat, and got off at Gage Town.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And the family went to a family by the name of Coy and they kept her for quite a while and her father didn't know where on earth she was.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
And he went to the captain of the boat and asked him if he'd seen anything of her.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Apparently she wants to hung around the boat some because they used to haul from the boat you know.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Anyway he said yes he took her up to Gage Town with him and she got off there.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
So Grandfather, great Grandfather Durex went up to see if he could find her.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
And the Coy's hit her.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:11.000
And when he went away they sent her up to Bear Island.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
To, I don't know what was the name of the place.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
She lived up Bear Island and she grew up.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
And she went by the name of Katherine, Katherine something else.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
The name was Katherine Durex.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
But she went by another name, Wilson I think.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:42.000
And then she fell in with Grandfather Hall and when he went to marry her she told him the truth of the matter, who she was.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000
And so he insisted that they marry, she marry under a right name.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
So it was William Hall and Katherine Durex that got married.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
So she changed her religion at that point if not before.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Yeah she was Protestant for the rest of her life.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
She was anything.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:09.000
And anyway they bought a farm at Lower Capital.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
And they lived there for a long time.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Well Grandfather was this kind.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
All anyone else had to do was come to him with a hard luck tale.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
And he'd give them the last cent he owned while their own family went neat.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
And that was to make Grandmother just raise you.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:36.000
She used to knit for sale and she'd wove and she worked outside and she thought what they earned they'd give to their own family.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
They had five, five girls.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
And one of them died in childhood and so she raised these four girls.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
So finally Grandfather said well, Katie, I guess we can't get along together.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
So we just did well if we separate.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Is that right?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
So he left.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
He says I'll leave you the farm and he says I'll go work in the mill.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:06.000
So he worked in a mill run by a man by the name of Burton and somebody else.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
By the way, Neil Burton was married to my cousin.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
It was his father I think.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
It was all the miller and grandfather.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:21.000
And so Grandfather Hall lived and worked in the mill as long as he was able to work.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
And Grandmother kept the farm.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Well she lived there by herself.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Well her girls grew up.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Grandma married Sam Howland as Frank's mother.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
And then two of them came down here and they married back into Catholic religion.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:46.000
There was Aunt Min, Allingham, and Aunt Alice Phillips.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
They found her eventually up there.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Was it her father or a brother or something who eventually chased her down?

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Her husband said one day, Casey said I think you should go down to see your people.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000
And the girls now are old enough to keep house and he says I want you to go down to see your people.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
So Casey came down on the boat.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
And she asked the boat captain if he knew.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
I'm listening to Michael Durich.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Michael Durich.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Yes he says they meet the boat every time it goes down and haul produce to the stores.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
He says they'll be there to meet the boat.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Well she said, would you point them out to me?

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000
She says I'm their sister but I haven't seen them since I was 13 years old.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
And they think I'm dead.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Well he says I'd do that.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Better than that I'll take an introduction.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
So he took her over and he introduced her to the two men.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
And they of course were astounded.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
They knew she was dead.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Her father and mother were gone.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
And there was an Aunt Mary who was an invalid.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
And both Michael and Thomas were married.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.000
So they took her to the house but they didn't take her to see Aunt Mary until they went in and broke the news.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Joyful news.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
So she had a visit with them and then of course she had to go home again.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:23.000
But every year after that she sent everything that she could, had to sell from the farm, she consigned it to her brothers.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:32.000
And they sold it to the best advantage and sent her back whatever she wanted in the way of flour and sugar and what not.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
And always added a little extra out of their own pockets.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
They were very good to her.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
She couldn't write.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
She never went to school to learn to write.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
And she used to have to get the postmasters to write her letters.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
And her postmasters I knew afterwards, years afterwards.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
And anyway.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
She lived up there on the farm for a good many years.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:08.000
And when her oldest girl, two older girls, well for one thing her brother lost his wife and he asked one of his girls to go down and keep house for him.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
He had two small children.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
And the other one came down to learn to be a tailoress.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
And they both married down here.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:25.000
As I say one was Aunt Nenalingham and one was Aunt Alice Phillips and their families.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
I don't know if that means anything around here now or not.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
But Aunt Alice is our southern day, the one from not long ago.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
I think my father used to see a bit of them when he was a boy.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Yes he did.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
He knew James Duritt and Josephine.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Now they were cousins of Grandmother Hollins.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000
They used to treat him and take him for rides in the streetcars I believe.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
James was awful nice.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
He was awful good to them.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
I never knew Aunt Alice.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
But I met one or two of her.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:08.000
I knew Arthur and Lewis and one or two, Rose I think it was, one of her girls.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000
And I have seen one or two of them but not to really know them.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:24.000
But anyway when Grandmother got ill the word was sent down to Grandmother Hollins, Frank's mother,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
that her mother was ill and somebody should look after her.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
And she wouldn't have the neighbors in.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Just by the side you know.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:40.000
And so Grandmother went up and they brought her down to live with them.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
She hadn't much use for Grandmother Hollins to tell you the truth.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
But she came because she couldn't do anything else.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
She couldn't sit there alone sick.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
And she lived with them for all quite a number of years.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
I don't know how long.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000
And I will admit she was not a very pleasant guest.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:08.000
She didn't care what she said or who she said it to.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000
She made life miserable for Grandmother, shamed her face more than once.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
I don't know how to tell you this on the tape or not.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
But when her husband died, when he got so he couldn't look after himself,

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:30.000
he went to live with the other Protestant sister, Hetty, down in St. Mary's.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
She took care of him until he died.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
They never saw one another.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
She old lady didn't go to see him and he didn't come to see her.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:49.000
And when she heard, when he died, Grandmother of course put on black as was expected.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000
And she started to go to church one morning.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000
All dressed in her black, you know, the long veil and all this trim that she liked.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Of course Grandma was prim.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000
And Grandmother's two brothers were over across the road,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
lying out on their lawn on a fine, bright, sunny morning.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Old Grandmother Holl, great-grandmother Holl,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
put her head out the window and she calls,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Lodge, Lodge, yes Mrs. Holl, what is it?

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Did you hear the news?

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
No, I don't think that I did.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
The devil's dead, don't you see his angel in the morning?

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
She said that too.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Poor Grandma that couldn't speak, didn't like Lodge howling anyway,

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
and she brought him up to church.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
And that's the sample, that's just one.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
And Frank said it wasn't living, it was just enduring what she lived with him.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
What did Catherine Durek look like?

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
I couldn't say, there was no picture of her.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
I would judge from her daughter that she probably wasn't a bad looking woman.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Because Aunt Min wasn't.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
I never saw an Alice, but Aunt Min was rather nice.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
I remember that distinct, was a really nice looking old lady.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Well, not so old when I knew her, but middle-aged woman,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
and she had kind of reddish hair, glinted red, you know,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
it wasn't a bright red like yours is, the definite red,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
but it had red lights in it, and she always had high colored rosy cheeks.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
And a very attractive woman, I thought.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
I wonder if the red hair comes from the...

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Comes from both sides.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
From both sides, does it?

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
You see, Grandfather Howland's mother was a graven,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
and they scotch, and they were the red scotch.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
There was ever so many redheads in the family.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000
I see.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
And there was one of them were braw boys, and his mother was one of the gravenses.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
And there was Tom Graham had...

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Oh, he had three redheads.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
There was redheads all the way through.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
And Elijah's oldest girl was redheaded, Elijah Howland's.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Yes.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
And of course, Grandfather had three of them redheaded,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
and when the third one showed up, he says,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
well, by criminy, that's the last.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Not many more redheads out there.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Which I thought was often funny.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
And then after me getting five, I didn't get a redhead.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
But it's come out again in the next generation.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000
It does.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Gene's got two redheaded children.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Yes.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
And you're redheaded.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
I like it, you know.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000
It seems to go together with black hair, doesn't it?

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
Often in our family, at least.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Either one extreme or the other, either black hair or red hair.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Look at mine.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Well, now, Evans got red hairs.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Red hairs, amongst his black hair.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
So had Burns.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
And so has Ele.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
And Eleanor had four, she got gray.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Every one of them had red hairs, but they weren't redheaded.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000
You know what I mean?

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Yes.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Just the odd red hair here and there in their hair.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
You know, I was sick of the piece when Gene turned up to be a redhead.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
And then when she had two redheaded children.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Of course, there's redheads in Laurie's side of the family, too.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Laurie himself was kind of that way.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000
It's nice to be different, I guess.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Oh, yes. Certainly.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Well, maybe that'll do for now.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
I don't want to tire her out.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000
I remember your mother bringing you up.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Bringing Henry up to show Grandfather.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
There now, Pa, she says.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
There's my redheaded boy.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
And he was as fair as anything else, not a sign of red.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
There's my redheaded boy.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Oh, dear God.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Old lady was down at all about 10 o'clock one morning.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
She dressed him in adzebrick.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
The fire was out.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
When Grandma heard her coming, she'd get the big handful of shavings

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
and stuff them in the soul.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000
And before she got time to set them alight, they'd all be down.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
She'd say, Dad, yes, she's waste all those shavings.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
She'd grab both of them out of the stove, put them under the bench again.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
And it was just a continual front.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Who was it? Was it the wine?

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Oh, Rondannan Williams.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
She would be Irvin Williams' mother.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
She's the one who liked the wine.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:59.000
She would be sister-in-law to Frank's grandmother, Howard, old Aunt Rosie.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
She was in Graham.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
And this Aunt Ann Graham was her sister-in-law.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
And she was kind.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
She came down, then up up.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
But she did like her little nickel of wine and kept her weight.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
And so she was helping herself to it.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Get this old devil out of here.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
She'd pick it up on my fourth wine.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Right in front of me, old Aunt Ann.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000
I'd be sitting in the middle of the window.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
I'm bending against you.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
She was a cold-blooded old girl.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Frank said it wasn't living, it's all in Annie.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
It was just existing, what you think.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
What's in these ever more?

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Said something about...

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Of course, Emma was pretty bit younger.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
But Frank, for me, was a very living woman.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
I've always wanted to get this thing straightened out the door.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
I never was clear on it.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
You see, she was a...

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
What have you got on your arm?

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Oh, that's his tie.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
The end of his tie there.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Oh, I see.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Looks like you get tied on your arm.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Is the house still there where James and Joseph came?

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
It's on Main Street, isn't it?

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
It's been fixed up a lot.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
It's been a few steps, I know.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Well, she's got to fix up a lot.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
I don't know about it, but it was a job.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Yeah.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
They've been dead for a long while.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Yes, and...
