00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Panorama, Richard Dimbleby and his spaghetti harvest.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.800
So it seems like my generation were the first group of youngsters who did their homework

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:22.240
and watched TV out of the corner of their eye.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:35.720
And Richard Dimbleby says, and now we are going to Italy for the spaghetti harvest.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:44.240
And a group of young women with the dishes of spaghetti and then we went out into the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:51.240
fields and saw the spaghetti hanging on trees like icicles.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.640
And I'm thinking, this isn't right.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.100
So I watched it avidly.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.560
Next morning's discussion on the playground was very serious about whether it was true

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.640
or not.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:18.440
So we picked up on the fact that the very serious Mr. Dimbleby was playing a joke on

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.720
the nation.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.420
I can't remember the newspaper headlines but I can remember the newspapers had a wonderful

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:39.120
time afterwards.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.680
I remember the television watching and doing homework.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:54.960
Much more interesting than mathematics was Vanessa Redgrave, a Shakespeare production.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.960
She was dressed as a boy.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:07.340
And I can't remember the name of the play.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.660
I think her character was really Viola and it was a swap over one.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:23.340
But Miss Redgrave dressed as a boy with a most lovely cap.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.740
And next day at school everybody wanted a cap like Miss Redgrave.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:31.900
We enjoyed the play.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.180
We did manage to answer up in class.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.500
But it was the cap and possibly the boots.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.660
Let's see, what?

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.700
Oh yes.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.980
I got the sitting room to myself.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:06.660
Anyway, my father was in the merchant service.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.420
He was a master mariner.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.500
He'd been home on leave, which was quite a short time in those days.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:28.020
And he was sailing two nights before a production of Carmen was to be on TV.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.540
And he said, you watch it.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.060
You watch it for me.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:42.140
So I have no idea who the singers were.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:49.580
I can remember having the sitting room to myself.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:57.500
And because my mother wasn't very keen on opera, much more a Radio Luxembourg fan.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:04.900
And so I had the sitting room to myself to watch Carmen.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:13.980
And I have enjoyed watching and listening to opera ever since.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.820
And of course I had a duty thing to do as well.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.900
Having watched it, I had to write a letter to catch my dad at CuraÃ§ao and tell him what

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.420
I thought about it.
