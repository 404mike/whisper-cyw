Marivith Lewis.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Sa ellos sy'n edrych am y dyfod,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
ymŵth Terfry mon, грlwyd legislation delwedd.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
No?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Too complicated.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But you were born in Cardinal, yes?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
No.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
That's not wrong now, is it?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Okay then, Ro.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Can you tell me where you were born and where you went to school?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I was born in Machynlleth,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
but I'd been brought up by an aunt in Cardinal.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So I went to school in Cardinal,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
then in Cardinal,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and then went to Newtown High School.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Okay, so primary education was in Cardinal,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and then your secondary in Newtown.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Okay, so how old were you when you left school?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Fifteen.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Right. Why did you leave? Did you have an option?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
No.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We all left at fifteen, most of us then.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Then I went back to Machynlleth,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
because I had two sisters working in the sewing factory in Machynlleth.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Right. So did you go back to live with them?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
For twelve months.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Right. And did you start work then in Machynlleth?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Yes.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So where was that?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
In Cardwells, sewing for my suspenders.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Okay.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And that was your first job on leaving school?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Yes, first job.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Did you have any training then to go into that factory?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
No, just because there were two sisters there.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Right, so they got you the job?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Yes.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Did they train you?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Yes, yes.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We had a row of trainees.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Right.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So was it difficult?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Yes, yes, yes.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
What was the most difficult thing then?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Like you were a young girl just leaving school.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
What was the most difficult thing about going into the workplace?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Well, it wasn't too bad knowing that you had somebody there.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So that helped.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And you did the sewing for the family.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And you did the same thing for about six weeks.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Which was, you had put the bias binding around the material.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
You had to get that right before they put you on something else then.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Did you pick that up pretty quickly?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Yes, yes, not too bad.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And did they put you on something else after that?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Yes, you'd go on another line then.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I can't really remember what it used to make then, you know.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So it was clothes for Marks and Spencer's, was it?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Yes, yes.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Was it a big factory?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Yes, it was.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I think it must have been an old school.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
It's right by the railway station.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I'm not sure if it's still a factory there to tell you.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And how long did you work there?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Twelve months.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Were there all women working there?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Mostly, yes, mostly.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Did you make friends there?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Yes, mostly.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Did you make friends there?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Yes, I did.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So did you like it?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Yes.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And why did you leave that factory?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
We had an offer of a job in Caerwna with Lor Ashwy.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Right.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And there was a little bit more money.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
What were you earning in the mychynllydd?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I think it was about £150 or something like that.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And then I had £4 a week.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
In Lor Ashwy.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And there was only me and my sister there.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Two machinists in Caerwna.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Right.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
You were the only two machinists?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Yes, yes.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
The first two.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Right.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So did you have to have an interview for the Caerwna job?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
I think it was my sister, Rosina,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
had the interview

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
because she worked in their home.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I see.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And she was a very good cook.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
She worked in their home first.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Okay.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
In the shop.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
I think it's a shop in mychynllydd.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
The black outside, Lor Ashwy.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And she worked in the back rooms there

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
for about four weeks, five weeks.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
So what was she doing?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Sewing.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Tea towels and oven gloves.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And there were like fisherman's tops.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
That's all.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So she heard about the job then

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
because she was working?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Well, it was the ones

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
that were brought up in Caerwna.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
It was them that heard that

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Lor Ashwy was coming there.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And he went there and said,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I've got somebody that can sew.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Because Caerwna wasn't a sewing place.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
There wasn't anybody in Caerwna.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So that's how we got the job.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So why did they pick Caerwna, do you think?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Cheap labour, I think.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So did you move to Caerwna then?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Yes, we moved.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And my sister came along as well.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
So where did you live in Caerwna?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
In where I'd been brought up with them.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
So you moved back to Caerwna really?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Yes, we did.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
So in Caerwna,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
were you happy to leave Machynllyth?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Yes, to go back.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Really?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Yes.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Because of the move to a different job or just different place?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
No, just going back to where I'd been brought up.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Right.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Yes.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So what did you do initially in the Caerwna?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Because you were there quite a long time, were you?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Well, we did nearly everything there.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
They used to have, they used to print,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
it was only tea towels then.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Tea towels.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Tea towels.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And they used to print the tea towels.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
They'd be in huge rolls.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Then we'd be cutting them.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Not just with a scissors,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
a big scissors.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
We'd cut them, sew down the sides.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Then you'd have to pack them.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And they'd go to the post office then.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Right.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
So only tea towels at that time.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Tea towels.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Do you remember what year that was, roughly?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Sixty...

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Would it be 63, 64?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
63, yes.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Something around there.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
So how many tea towels did you have to produce a day then?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Thousands.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Yes.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
It was nearly the same as what you used to be trained for.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
You know with the bias binding.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Right.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
You'd be putting it through like a little bias binding thing.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And you'd just go do one side.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And cut them all.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Then do the other side.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
So did you enjoy the work?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Oh yes.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
It was just like an old shed.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Right.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
There was nothing there.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Nothing there at all.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
So did they bring in sort of facilities for you?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Proper work tops and heating and stuff like that?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
No.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Toilet.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Gosh.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Describe the room.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
The room.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
The room.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Describe the room for me.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Petitioned.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
It was a huge, huge working club.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Which had lost their license.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And it was just petitioned off.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
The main place would be where the printers were.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Then they'd petition it off.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And the machinists would be in here.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
But another petition for the office.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Like two telephones.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Another petition for his...

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I don't know.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I don't know.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Or is...

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
To do the...

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Like black...

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
No.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Ways to do the prints.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Like photography and things like that.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Right.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Printing, you know.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
But it was part of the same factory, wasn't it?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Huge. Just one room was split into about three sections.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Huge. Just one room was split into about three sections.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Right.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
So they provided you with your own sewing machine.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
We had a big sewing machine.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And then we had the big ones.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Yes, we did have sewing machines.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And an overlocker.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
We had one of them.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And an overlocker is the...

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Like the four big...

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
That does the...

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Finishing.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Like that.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
But then you didn't want that for the tea towels.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
But then you didn't want that for the tea towels.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
The overlocker came a bit later when they started doing dresses.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
The overlocker came a bit later when they started doing dresses.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
So were you doing tea towels for a long time before the dresses came in?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
So were you doing tea towels for a long time before the dresses came in?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Yes, and oven gloves and like these fishermen with pockets in the front.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Yes, and oven gloves and like these fishermen with pockets in the front.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
They were like garden...

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Like smocks.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So was there...

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Did they have heating and light?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Oh, the lights, yes.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Oh, the lights, yes.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
There was lights.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
But I can't remember much of heating there.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Did you have to wear a uniform?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
No.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
No.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
But then later on when they started making these...

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Smocks, everybody be wearing them.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Oh, really?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Yes, you'd be wearing them for work, like isn't it.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
But did they give them to you?

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Or did you have to buy them?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
No, I'm sure we used to...

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
I'm sure they used to give them to us.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
I can't remember to tell you the truth.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I'm sure that it used to be like...

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I'm sure that it used to be like...

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
seconds material or something.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Yn ogystal â'r cyhoeddus a'r cyhoeddus?

Nid yw'n oed, nid yw'n oed, amdano'r ffatri mwyaf o'r lles ymlaen.

Rwy'n ddod o ddod o ddod yn y lles ymlaen.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Yn oed, ond roedd yna ddwy o'n oed.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Felly pan ddwyddoch yna yna ddwy, ymlaen at y cyhoeddus, roedd yna ddwy o bobl.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Yn oed, roedd unrhyw ddwy oedd o London gyda Bernard Ashley, a roedd hi'n y manegor yno.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000

Roedd yna ddwy o'n oed yn y ffatri, a Tony Shepherd ei ddyn nhw.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
A dyna yna.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Felly roedd yna ddwy o bobl yn dod o ddod o'r ffatri mwyaf o'r lles ymlaen?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Yn oed.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Roedd hi'n dod o ddod o'r ffatri.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Ond roeddwn i ddim yn ymlaen o'r ffatri oherwydd ein bod yn ymwneud â ni.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Ond roedd nhw wedi eu brosio'r ffatri i fynd i fyny.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Roedd nhw wedi?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Roedd gennym ni'n ddwy o ddwy o ffatri a roedd nhw wedi'i brosio'r ffatri i fyny.

Roedd y ffatri yn ddod i gynnig i chi ac yna rydych chi'n ddod i'r ddwy.

ond nid yw'r un.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.520
Beth oedd ydych chi'n gwneud yn y lle fwyaf?

A phan oedd,

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.520
rwy'n meddwl,

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.520
rydym ni ddim yn cael hyn heddiw.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.520

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.520
Roeddwn ni ddim yn cael hyn heddiw,

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.520
a'u helpu a'u bach.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.520
Roeddwn ni ddim wedi gwneud nid o'r hyn.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.520
Roeddwn ni ddim wedi gwneud nid o'r hyn.

Roeddwn ni ddim wedi gwneud nid o'r hyn.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.520
Roeddwn ni ddim wedi gwneud nid o'r hyn.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.520
A phan oedd yn cael eu peth,

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.520
a phan oedd yn cael ei peth.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.520
Beth oedd oedd yn cael eu peth?

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.520
Mae'n cael ei hun,

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.520
neu unrhyw beth,

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.520
yn y peth,

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.520
ond pan fyddwn nhw'n mynd i'r peth,

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.520
roedd y cantin gwych.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.520
Roedd hi'n fwyaf,

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.520
nid o chwipiau.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.520
Felly, beth o'r ffordd ei wneud?

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.520
Felly, beth o'r ffordd ei wneud?

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.520
Felly, beth o'r ffordd ei wneud?

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.520
Roedd hi'n fwyaf i'r ffordd ei wneud.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.520
Roedd hi'n fwyaf i'r ffordd ei wneud?

Rydw i'n dweud o'r holl gweithredu i gyrraedd.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.520
O'r holl ffactor yma?

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.520
Rydw i'n ychwanegu'r sample ymlaen.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.520
Mae'r ddau o'r holl pwysau.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.520
Rydw i'n ychwanegu'r sample.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:51.520
Yr un o'r sample?

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.520
Mae'n cymryd, mae'n gweithredu adeilad newydd.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.520
roedd angen i'w gwneud o'n gwybodaeth.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.520
Oherwydd os yw hyn ddim yn cyd-u,

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:07.520
mae angen i'w gwneud arall angen i'w gwneud angen i'w gweithio yn y flwyddyn ymlaen,

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.520
a byddai'n gwneud oedden nhw o bryd.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.520
Felly pan dweud y byddai angen i chi gweithio ymlaen,

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.520
byddai'n ei gweithio yn ymlaen.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.520
Ie, ie.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.520
A oedd angen i'w gwneud yn y dda,

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:21.520
felly byddai'n mynd yn ôl i'r bwynt o'r teimau angen,

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.520
a bydd hi'n ei ddweud,

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.520

Roeddwn yn mynd i'r gweithdau a byddwn yn cael ei ddarparu.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:59.520
Roeddwch chi'n cael y ddarparu yn brys?

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.520
Ie, gallwch chi ddarparu nhw'n brys iawn.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:09.520
Roeddwch chi'n brys nhw i'r adnoddau i'ch ffamiliau a'u ffrindiau?

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.520
Rwy'n credu bod pawb yn y ffamiliau wedi cael teitl.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:19.520
Roedd y ffamiliau cyntaf oedd...

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:27.520
Roedd y ffamiliau bach ganddiol bach a'i ffamiliau fel 2 t-towelau.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.520
Roedd?

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.520
Ie, y ffamiliau.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:35.520
Roedd y ffamiliau cyntaf oedd y ffamiliau cyntaf.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.520
Roedd yn ffamiliau fel y ffamiliau ymlaen.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.520
Ond yn y ffamiliau...

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:46.520
Yn y ffamiliau cyntaf fel t-towelau, roedd yn mynd yn fwy.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:52.520
Yn y ffamiliau cyntaf, roedd yn ffamiliau'r cwmpas a'n sôn nhw i'w gyd.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:56.520
O, gwelwch? Fodd y cyntaf wedi'i ddod i'r ystod yna a fydd yn sôn?

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.520
Ie, ie.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.520
Rwy'n meddwl hynny.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:06.520
Roeddwch chi'n meddwl y byddwch chi'n gwneud, oherwydd mae Lora Ashley yn fan hynny'n iconig, yw hynny?

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.520
Roeddwch chi'n meddwl bod e'n mynd i'n ffamiliau?

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.520
Nid.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.520
Nid.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.520
Ond nid oes wedi'i gweithio, nid yn.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.520
Rwy'n meddwl?

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:17.520
Nid.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.520
Mae'n gwybod chi'n meddwl.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:27.520
Yn oed yn dda, roeddwn i'n mynd yn ymwneud i ffrindiau ymchwil a phethau fel hynny.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:31.520
Felly roeddwn nhw'n eu hysgwch ar un ffrindiau ymchwil i chi, yw'r gweithwyr?

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:38.520
Nid yn y cyfnod, nid pan oeddwn yn unrhyw un, pan oedd yn mynd yn y brifysgol.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.520
Rwy'n meddwl.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.520
A beth oedd nhw'n ei ffamiliau ar un ffrindiau ymchwil?

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.520
Rwy'n ffantastig.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:43.520
Roedd nhw'n?

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.520
Ie, iawn.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.520
Mae'n dda.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.520
Roedd nhw'n rhoi ffyrdd?

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.520
Ie, iawn, rhai.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.520
A gallai'r ffamiliau i'n mynd?

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.520
A allai'n mynd i'ch penderfyniad?

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.520
Ie, iawn.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.520
Roedd nhw wedi cael rhai ffrindiau dda.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.520
Roedd nhw wedi cael unrhyw ffrindiau anylau anhygoel?

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.520
Nid, dwi ddim yn gallu ei fathu.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.520
Ond llawer wedi'i gael ar ôl pan oeddwn i'n mynd.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.520
Rwy'n meddwl.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:17.520
Roeddwn i'n bwysig ymlaen, yn y bryd, yn y bryd, yn y bryd, yn y bryd, yn y bryd, yn y bryd, yn y bryd.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.520
A oeddwch chi'n cael ei ffeilio yn y bryd, yn y bryd?

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.520
Roedd yn mynd yn fwy fwy fwy.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.520
O, iawn, iawn.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:34.520
Ond yn oed pan dwi'n mynd i weithio nawr a mynd i'r pwb lleol, mae'n angen i'r ffrindiau a'r ffrindiau.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:39.520
Felly, oeddwch chi'n cael ffrindiau yn y ffatri, a ffrindiau yn y ffatri arall?

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.520
Roeddwn i'n gwybod nhw'n ffrindiau arall.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:49.520
Roeddwn i'n cael, fel, roeddwn i'n cael ffri, ffri, ffrindiau, ffrindiau, ffrindiau, ffrindiau, ffrindiau, ffrindiau.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:54.520
Roedd yn cael ffrindiau o ran un o'r ffrindiau yno.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.520
Mae'n angen.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.520
Ie, roedd yn angen.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.520
Felly, oeddwch chi'n cymdeithio gyda'r unrhyw bobl yn y bryd a'r bryd?

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.520
Ie. Roeddwn i'n mynd i ysgol gyda'r un ymlaen.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.520
Rhaid.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.520
Roeddwn i'n cymdeithio gyda'r un ymlaen.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:21.520
A roeddwn yn ffyrdd iawn oherwydd roedd wedi cael ymlaen o ran y ddau yn y ffrindiau.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.520
Mr. Ashley.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:31.520
A roedd yna, i'r gweithwyr, roeddwn yn cael ymlaen o'nno.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.520
6 o ddau yn cael ei wneud.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.520
Roedd yn unrhyw bobl, ond i'n unrhyw bobl.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.520
Roeddwn i'n unrhyw bobl sydd wedi cael ei gwaith.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.520
A roeddwn yn cael ei gwaith ar y brif.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.520
Felly roedd hi'n cael ddau yn y ffordd o'r ddau?

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:50.520
Roeddwn yn cael ddau o ddau i'w gweithwyr i wneud y ddau.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.520
Felly roedd hi wedi cael ei gwaith yna?

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.520
Mae'n gwaith o ddau.

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.520
O, yn fawr.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.520
Ie, ar ddau.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:57.520
Ar ddau, roedd yn cael?

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.520
Ie.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:02.520
Ar y ddau, roedd gan gynnydd a'r ffyrdd.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.520
Roedd gynnydd o'r ddau yn gweithio ar hynny.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.520
Roeddwn yn llwyr yn gyflym i gael un.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.520
Felly roeddech chi'n ddod i gyrraedd ar y brif o ddau?

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.520
Dwi ddim yn gallu ei gyd.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.520
Dwi ddim yn gallu ei gyd amdano y bydda i.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:24.520
Rwy'n credu bod roedd e'n eu gyrraedd i brynu'r brif.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:27.520
Felly, sut wnaeth ychwanegu am fod yn gallu cael ei ddod?

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.520
O, ddod yn llawer ddod.

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.520
Rydyn ni'n llawer ddod.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.520
Ond rwy'n credu bod un hanner o'r canol yn llawer ddod.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.520
Ie, mae'n rhaid i chi ddod.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.520
Ie, byddai'n dweud hynny hefyd.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:44.520
Felly, fe ddodd ymlaen i'ch ddod o'ch ddod o'ch eich hun?

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.520
Ie, fe ddodd ymlaen i'ch ddod o'ch ddod o'ch ddod o'ch eich hun?

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:21.520
Mi eraill eyorang y bysattais oedd y gynysgar maais, oesnodd dros yr hyn rydw i'm gweithio.

Ond ychwanegwch y carner o fe wnaeth chi gyrda genlyniadol yn y goda?

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:48.520
Mae'n ffordd newydd, ac roedd yn tawrwyr, ac wedi mynd i Denby.

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.520
Roedd hynny i gydag gweithwyr?

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.520
Ie, gyda'i gweithwyr.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:59.520
Felly pan dweud y byddai eich gwerthau yn ymwych, roedden nhw'n mynd i mewn i'r bot, neu roedden chi'n mynd i mewn i'r bach?

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.520
Rwy'n cael rhan o'n bach i mi.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:07.520
Rwy'n cael rhan o'n bach i mi.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.520
Mae'n dda iawn.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:14.520
Felly beth wnaethon nhw i'r carnaw pan dweud y byddai'n gweithio?

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:19.520
Beth oedd y bydau'n bach, neu oedd y byddai'n bach am y bydau ymlaen?

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.520
Nid, rydym wedi mynd i mewn.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:29.520
Mae'n mynd i mewn i mewn i'r ffridydd, a dyna'r pwmpen sydd wedi mynd i fynd i ni ar y ddiwedd.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.520
Roedd yn? Oedd yn mynd i mewn i?

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.520
A phan o'n bach, rydym wedi mynd i fynd i Dynas Mawddoi.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.520
Why?

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:42.520
Roeddwn nhw wedi cael ymlaen ymlaen ymlaen, a...

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.520
Roedd yna ddodd Rodmouth, oedd yn cael ymlaen.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:54.520
Roeddwn wedi cael ymlaen o'r ddodd oedd yn cael ymlaen o'r ddodd, a bob ddwy ddwy oedd yn cael ymlaen ymlaen, a byddwn wedi cael ymlaen ymlaen.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:28:01.520
Oedden ni'n mynd i fynd i'r ddodd, ac wrth gwrs, byddwn i'n cael ymlaen i unrhyw un o'r byddiad.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:08.520
Roeddwn yn mynd i fynd i'r ddodd, a byddwn yn cael ymlaen i unrhyw un o'r byddiad.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:13.520
Ond yn ystod yno, nid oes gennym drinx yn y byddiad.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.520
Felly, fe ddodd yn ôl i ffyrdd o te?

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.520
Ffyrdd o te, dyna'r hyn.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.520
Ond roedd yn gael drinx yn y pub, dwi'n credu.

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.520
Ie.

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.520
Beth oedd pobl yn gael drinx yno?

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:26.520
Port and Lemon, roeddwn yn gael drinx.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.520
Andromen, gwbl, a'r man oedd yn gael drinx. Port and Lemon.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:34.520
A'r llwyth a'r orff, dwi'n credu, oedd o'n oed.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:40.520
Felly, fe ddodd yn ôl i ffyrdd o te?

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.520
Ffartreidd yng nghymdeithas?

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:46.520
Ie, fe ddodd yn ôl i ffyrdd o te, ac yn ôl i ffyrdd o te hefyd.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.520
Oedden nhw'n ôl i ffyrdd o'r holl.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:52.520
Beth oedd yn ôl i ffyrdd o'r holl?

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.520
Mae'n dda iawn.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.520
Yn y llwyth a'r orff?

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.520
Rwy'n dda iawn.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:02.520
Yn y llwyth a'r orff, fe ddodd yn ôl i ffyrdd o te hefyd.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.520
Beth oedd yn ôl i ffyrdd o'r holl?

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.520
Yn y llwyth a'r orff, fe ddodd yn ôl i ffyrdd o'r holl.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:11.520
Roeddwch chi'n mynd i weithio neu'n mynd i ddodd yn ôl i ffyrdd o'r holl?

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.520
Roeddwch chi'n mynd i weithio?

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.520
Ie, rydw i'n mynd i weithio.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.520
Ie.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.520
Yn ystod?

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.520
Nid.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.520
Beth oeddwch chi'n mynd i weithio?

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:26.520
Roeddwn ni'n mynd i weithio yng Nghymru yn llawer.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.520
Mae gennym ffamiliau yng Nghymru.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.520
Felly roeddwn ni'n mynd i weithio yng nghymru yn llawer.

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.520
Ie.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.520
Roeddwn ni wedi cael cerddau caravan.

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.520
Roeddwn ni'n mynd i weithio yng nghymru yn y caravan?

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.520
Roeddwn ni'n mynd i weithio yng Nghymru yn yng nghymru.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.520
O, mae'n teimlo, mae'n mynd i weithio y caravan gyda chi?

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.520
Nid, nid, nid. Mae'n mynd i weithio yng nghymru.

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.520
Yn ystadeg?

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.520
Ie.

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:53.520
Felly, yn y ffactor, yn y ffactor newydd,

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.520
roedd yn dda mewn i'r gweithwyr neu roedd yn cael ymwybydd o'r gweithwyr hefyd?

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.520
Ymwybydd o'r gweithwyr hefyd.

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.520
Roedd ymwybydd?

00:29:58.520 --> 00:29:59.520
Ie, gwasanaethau.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.520
Felly, beth yw'r gwasanaethau arfer?

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.520
Rwy'n meddwl, roedd y gweithwyr yn cael ei gweithio.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.520
Mae'n bwysig, roedd y gweithwyr yn cael ei gweithio.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.520
Ie, a'r gweithwyr yn cael ei gweithio.

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:10.520
O, roedd y gweithwyr yn cael ei gweithio?

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.520
Roedd y gweithwyr yn cael ei gweithio.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:17.520
Ie, ond bynnag, roedd gweithwyrion gweithio'n cael ei gweithio,

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.520
na fel mynd i'n cael gyda'r scissorau.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.520
Roedd gweithwyrion gweithio'n cael ei gweithio,

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.520
bach bach ysglaeol, ysglaeol hawl,

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.520
a ydych chi'n gwybod ymlaen ato,

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.520
a dyna oedd dda, oedd ymlaen,

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.520
dydyn nhw'n gwneud hynny ymlaen.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:37.520
Felly roedd y gweithwyr a'r gweithwyr mewn unio mewn rhan gweithiau?

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.520
Mae'n gwneud unrhyw sections.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:48.360
Ond y cyffredinau, pan oeddwn i yno, roedd rai a rai o ddryfusion a yna'r cyffredinau oedd yn y botwm.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:58.180
A yna'r section arall, mae'n cael y prynterau a yna'r section arall, lle byddai'r drosau yn mynd i'r ddryfus,

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:02.680
ac yn ymwneud â'r pethau i'r lorydd.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.620
Felly, byddai'n gallu gweld yn y sectionau arall?

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:06.280
Nid.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:09.220
Felly, dydw i ddim yn gweithio yn eich section, yna, gyda'r mwyaf?

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:10.220
Ie.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:11.220
Roedd yn gweithio gyda'r mwyaf?

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:12.220
Ie, y section arall.

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:13.220
Y section arall.

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:14.220
Ie.

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:21.140
A yna byddai'n cael y prynterau a'r sectionau a'r section arall yn y bryd.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:24.860
Felly, byddai'n gallu gilyddio â'r unrhyw un yn y section arall?

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:25.860
Ie.

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.740
Roedd hi'n ddifysgio gael y cyfnod?

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:34.660
Ond yna, oedd yna, dydw i'n credu, roedd yna gwaith amgueddfeydd yna, oedd yna.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:35.660
Beth yna gwaith amgueddfeydd?

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:41.300
Rhun, hu- perhaps you can, but can everyone, your milk will go on your own.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:46.160
You weren't able to, you weren't able toARTU777 because you were as young and as

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.160
Listen.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.220
What was something that I was not able to do?

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:54.460
I heard that you weren't in a good situation.

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.820
That I couldn't have a contraction.

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:56.820
Other.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:57.820
It makes you feel better?

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.820
Nid oes.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.820
Roedd e'n mynd yn y mor, a'r hwn yn ymwneud a dyna byddai'n hynny.

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:03.820
Ond fe wnaethon nhw gweithio?

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:05.820
Nid, nid, nid, dwi'n gallu gwneud hynny.

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:08.820
Felly byddai'n siarad gyda'r bobl yn gweithio ar eich ardal?

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.820
Iawn, fe wnaethon nhw gwneud y sample.

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:12.820
Rwy'n dda.

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:14.820
Felly beth o brydau ydych chi'n siarad am y gweithio?

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.820
Mae'r radiu wedi bod yn cael ei gweithio arall ddiwethaf.

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:17.820
Roedd e'n?

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:18.820
Mae'n cael ei gweithio arall ddiwethaf.

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:19.820
Yn ystod?

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.820
Iawn.

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.820
Arall ddiwethaf.

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:27.820
A gallwch chi siarad fel hyn, oherwydd byddai'n cael unrhyw un o'r ystod.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.820
Rwy'n dda.

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:36.820
Ond pan oeddwn i ystod yno, yn y cyfnod,

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:39.820
roedd gennych chi'n siarad am y gweithio arall ddiwethaf.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:43.820
Ond yn ystod yna, dwi'n credu,

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:47.820
dwi'n dweud, dwi'n dweud, dwi ddim yn bwysig,

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:51.820
roedd gennych chi'n siarad unrhyw un o'r ystod.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.820
Iawn.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.820
Ond pan oeddwn i'n siarad.

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:57.820
Ond pan oeddwn i'n gweithio arall yma,

00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:59.820
roedd gennych chi'n siarad am y gweithio arall ddiwethaf hefyd.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:01.820

Roedd hi'n amser iawn.

A oedd yn ymddygiad o unrhyw amser neu unrhyw beth oedd yn ymddygiad y gweithwyr?

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:44.820
O'r ffwrdd?

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.820
Nid.

Roedd e'n meddwl bod yn gweithwyr hefyd.

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:12.820
Roedd hi?

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:13.820

Ond oedd yn ymddygiad o unrhyw amser, e,

dwi'n meddwl bod ymddysg a'r amser yn dod i'n ymddygiad, e, nid oes.

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.820
Felly, ym ymddygiad ymlaen,

Roedd hynny'n oed yn rhywbeth i chi?

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.820
Ie.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:51.820
Roedd hi'n hurtio.

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:52.820
Roedd hi'n hurtio.

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:54.820
A roedden nhw'n ddod oes ymddygiad o'r amser?

Nid yn yr un ymddygiad.

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:06.820
Nid yn yr un ymddygiad.

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:10.820

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:14.820
Roedd yna.

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:15.820
Roedd yna.

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:24.820

Felly roedd gennych chi unrhyw amser?

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:28.820
Nid.

Nid.

Mae'n rhaid i chi.

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:08.820
Do you know what, I can. I really can't remember. Can't remember that at all.

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:15.820
But you were saying that on a Friday, Laura actually finished at 12. The whole factory shut at 12 and everybody came out.

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:16.820
Yes.

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:18.820
And then you went?

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:25.820
Well, your buses would be there or whatever, isn't it? Yes, she was good like that.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:29.820
So when you finished early on a Friday, did you come straight home or did you go shopping?

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:38.820
No, I'd go straight home. I couldn't drive then when I worked there. I used to go home.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:45.820
Andy used to come home on a Friday sometimes. He'd go away on a Monday back on a Friday.

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:48.820
So were you children home early on a Friday as well?

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:50.820
No, three o'clock from school.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.820
So were you able to collect them then on a Friday?

00:36:53.820 --> 00:37:00.820
Yes, yes. It's only walking. Everything's a walking distance in the village.

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:05.820
So when you were working on the other days, you finished at five, did you?

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.820
No, I finished at three.

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:09.820
At three the whole time when you wanted out your children?

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:14.820
Yes, because they were still young when we moved up here.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:21.820
So I always did a nine till quarter to three then, and most of the holidays off.

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:23.820
I always did that.

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:29.820
So before we finish, Laura Ashley, do you want to tell me about the football match?

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:33.820
They did have a ladies' team.

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:34.820
Did they?

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:42.820
Yes, we had a ladies' team. I think somebody hadn't turned up one day and they put me in the goalie, so I just went in.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:45.820
I think I let about ten in.

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:48.820
So where did they used to practice then?

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:53.820
On the local pitch, on Cynonoghol football field.

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:57.820
So did you play then against neighbouring teams?

00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:01.820
Yes, and perhaps a neighbouring factory.

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:07.820
They had factories everywhere. They had factories in Machanllyf, Llanidloes, everywhere.

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:11.820
The whole town. And it could have been against them.

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:16.820
So did they say it was a away game? They used to take you in a bus?

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:21.820
Yes, I think some people used to have cows by then as well.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:28.820
They were desperate that day, they asked me. I can tell you now.

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:30.820
So you weren't in the team?

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:31.820
Oh no, not really.

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:32.820
You didn't want to be?

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.820
No.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.820
But was there a men's team and a women's team separate?

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:42.820
No, there wasn't a men's team.

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.820
Just a women's team.

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:50.820
So the girls that were in the team, they really liked it, presumably.

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:56.820
Yes, I don't think they just did it. I'm not sure if they did it for charity or something like that.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:57.820
Right.

00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:58.820
Yes.

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:04.820
So when you moved up here, you moved for your husband's work, did you?

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:05.820
Yes.

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:09.820
But then you got a job pretty much straight away, did you, up here?

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.820
Yes, in another sewing factory.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:13.820
Right.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:21.820
Working with the Welsh wool tapestry work, which was very, very popular then as well.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.820
And do you remember the name of the factory?

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:25.820
Yes, John Rowe.

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:26.820
John Rowe?

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:27.820
John Rowe Fashion.

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:30.820
Okay. And that was actually in Denby, wasn't it?

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:34.820
Yes, in Denby, above a delicatessance shop.

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:43.820
And you had to go up and up. That was a small place. I've always worked in really small factories.

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:44.820
Right.

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:53.820
Like, not many people working. I think there was eight or nine machinists there as well.

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:54.820
Right.

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:59.820
And two pressers. And that was the same in a cutting room.

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:00.820
Right.

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:01.820
And that was just the same.

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:03.820
How did you get that job?

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:04.820
I just went for an interview.

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:05.820
Right.

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:12.820
And that was another one. I went for an interview in two places. One was a shirt factory that used to be here.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:21.820
But you had to work half a day till five. And then John Rowe let me work again, start at nine and finish at three.

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:22.820
Right.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.820
And that's why I took that again.

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:27.820
How old were you when you started with John Rowe?

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:37.820
Thirty. Something like that.

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:42.820
So by that point, were you a skilled machinist then?

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:44.820
Oh, I never call myself skilled.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:46.820
No. Experienced.

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.820
Yeah. I've never. You learn and still learning.

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:50.820
Right.

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:52.820
I think so. I learnt a lot from that factory.

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:53.820
Why was that?

00:40:53.820 --> 00:41:02.820
Well, it was, you had to, the matching of the skirts and the tapestry had to be exactly the same.

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:03.820
Right.

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.820
I did learn a lot from them.

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:07.820
Yeah.

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:13.820
Did you feel confident when you went from Laura Ashley's to them because of the experience?

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:14.820
Yes.

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:17.820
Was it different to Laura Ashley?

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:22.820
Oh, yes. Because Laura Ashley was cotton and this was wool, thick wool, wasn't it?

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:23.820
Gosh.

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:27.820
You're working with a different material altogether.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.820
So was that transition difficult?

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:34.820
Yes, it was. It was quite hard to work with that.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:35.820
Was it the same?

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:39.820
And the skirts were all lined and everything with the tapestry skirts.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:44.820
And all lining in the capes, the cloaks that they used to make, isn't it?

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:47.820
Tapestry, Welsh tapestry cloaks.

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:48.820
Right.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:52.820
So do you remember what your interview was like? Was it difficult?

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:55.820
Because you'd come from a different material?

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:58.820
No.

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:06.820
I think they must have given me a piece of material and gone on the sewing machine.

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:07.820
Right.

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.820
I think I did a lot of work in the interview.

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:17.820
And I think if you can control the machine and things like that, that helped.

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:19.820
So the machines were the same, basically, wasn't it?

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:20.820
Yes.

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:21.820
The same.

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:23.820
What were the new people like to work for?

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:30.820
Still, very nice. I've always liked all my bosses.

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:32.820
What about the new people you were working with?

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:34.820
Fine, yes.

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:35.820
Were they all women?

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:39.820
Yes, all women there. There wasn't any men at all.

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:40.820
Right, oh really?

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:48.820
No, no men at all. There were two lady bosses and, like I said, about eight machinists.

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:53.820
And there was a buttonhole, the girl that did the buttonholes did the overlocking.

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:57.820
And then there was two pressers. That was it.

00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:01.820
And that was the same again. You had a cup of tea in the corner.

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:03.820
Was it? Oh, no canteen then?

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:12.820
No canteen. But it was in the town because you could always go out at lunchtime to get whatever you wanted.

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:16.820
And did you make friends easily in the new place?

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.820
Yes, still, with some of them.

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:20.820
Was it a nice atmosphere?

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:24.820
Oh yes, it was. I think the smaller the better.

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:28.820
And was there chatting and was there a radio?

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:33.820
Radio, yes, but not too much chatting.

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:35.820
Oh, why was that?

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:43.820
Because the cutting, where they cut, she had a window there. She'd tap in that sometimes.

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:46.820
Really? To stop you talking?

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:47.820
Yes.

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:50.820
Oh my gosh. Were they stricter than Laura Ashley then?

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:55.820
No, not really, but if they wanted something else, you've just got to get on with it.

00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:59.820
And then you start giggling then, don't you? You can't stop it.

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:02.820
And you're trying to put your head down.

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:08.820
She was talking about that when we met in the reunion in the summer.

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:14.820
And she said, we all said, remember that window you had? Tapping at us.

00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:17.820
She was laughing.

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:21.820
So how long were you in the factory here in Rose?

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:32.820
Oh, a few years.

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.820
And why did you leave?

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:37.820
I wasn't well. I wasn't well.

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:44.820
So I was waiting to go in for an operation and I just couldn't sit by the machine then for a while.

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:46.820
And that was why.

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:52.820
I was going to ask about that because when you sit in the machine all day, it must be on your back.

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:54.820
Yes.

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:59.820
Back of your back.

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:04.820
So you feel you've sort of inherited this back problem with your work.

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:06.820
Yes.

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:10.820
So when you left there, is that when you more or less retired from factory work?

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:11.820
No.

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:13.820
Okay. What did you do then?

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:19.820
Yes, I did for a while. I went into working in a nursing home.

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:23.820
But I was sewing as well in a nursing home.

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:31.820
I was sewing for the council in the old people's home, which I'm in there now, but I haven't got my rose.

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:36.820
And I used to work then nine till twelve sewing.

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:45.820
And then I used to go into a care home three till seven or something like that in a care home as well.

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:47.820
I almost worked.

00:45:47.820 --> 00:46:01.820
And then they offered me more hours in the care home, which I'm still doing today, is to look after the residents' clients' clothes.

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:02.820
Right.

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:07.820
And I do the sewing and zips or whatever.

00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:15.820
And then I help ironing or whatever one's doing.

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:16.820
Right.

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:23.820
And me and another girl pick the colours for the bedrooms and the curtains and the bedding and stuff like that.

00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:24.820
Right.

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.820
The boss calls me the housekeeper.

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:31.820
Makes sure there's towels in the bathrooms and things like that.

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:39.820
But being between that, I was sewing in the Tweedmill textiles as well.

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:40.820
Right.

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:41.820
And that's in Denby.

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:43.820
That's still going in Denby.

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:44.820
Right.

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:51.820
I started off just going to help cut out one evening and I stayed there for a few years.

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:52.820
Did you?

00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:58.820
So my days off, I was going there sewing or whatever they wanted me to do, you know, cutting there as well.

00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:00.820
So you were working in the care home?

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:02.820
And part-time in the textile?

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:05.820
I was self-employed in the textile.

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:06.820
Right.

00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:09.820
So if I didn't want to go in, I didn't have to.

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:11.820
I didn't have to go in.

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:15.820
But no, I'm still friends with them, still go and see them.

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:16.820
Yes.

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:19.820
You mentioned the reunion you had a few minutes ago.

00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:20.820
That was with the other.

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:22.820
That was with John Rowe.

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:23.820
Right.

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:24.820
But is that an annual thing?

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:25.820
No.

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:27.820
It was a one-off.

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:31.820
There's a vintage shop in town and it was them.

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:36.820
Somebody had taken one of the capes in and they just put it in the free press.

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:43.820
Anybody who worked in John Rowe, get in touch with us, we're thinking of doing a reunion.

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:46.820
And we had afternoon tea in the chapel.

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:49.820
Best tree, you know, not the best tree up there.

00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:51.820
So did all the girls go back?

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:53.820
Lots of them did, yeah.

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:55.820
There must have been about 20 of us there.

00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:59.820
And we had a good chat, you know.

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:04.820
So have you several kept in touch, because you've obviously moved to a few different places.

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:06.820
Have you made friends and kept in touch with them?

00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:07.820
Yes.

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:10.820
We were in a wedding now with one of them.

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:14.820
She got married for the first time, she was 55.

00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:16.820
On which factory was that?

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:17.820
That was from John Rowe.

00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:18.820
Was it?

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:19.820
Yes.

00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:21.820
And she worked in the factory in Corwen.

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:22.820
Right.

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:25.820
And she did, she was still working Corban High.

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:28.820
And yeah, I'm still in touch with her as well.

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:34.820
So when you look back on all these years you worked in the factory, have you enjoyed it?

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:35.820
Oh yes.

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:36.820
Hard.

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:38.820
Really hard sometimes.

00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:39.820
Why hard?

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:40.820
What was the hard thing?

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:45.820
Cold sometimes.

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:49.820
Your hands, my hands, I do suffer from my hands a lot now.

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:56.820
And I think it's from working, doing the same, isn't it?

00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:57.820
Repetitive.

00:48:57.820 --> 00:48:58.820
Yes.

00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:01.820
It does affect your hands.

00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:05.820
I've always enjoyed it.

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:08.820
So what are your best memories?

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:13.820
All the different ones, isn't it?

00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:17.820
Is it the camaraderie or the actual work?

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:19.820
Yeah, I do enjoy the work.

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:20.820
I do.

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:27.820
But as long as there's no pressure on me, I can go on my own pace, isn't it?

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:30.820
Has that been the case in most of the factories?

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:32.820
Yes, I've never been on peace work.

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:33.820
Never.

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:34.820
I couldn't do that.

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:36.820
I couldn't do peace work.

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:40.820
So do you have any bad memories from any of the factories?

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:43.820
No, no, not really.

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:45.820
No.

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:46.820
No.

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:48.820
And I'm still sewing.

00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:51.820
I've still got sewing machines in the garage.

00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:52.820
Have you?

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:53.820
Yeah.

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:54.820
Just back on a minute.

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:58.820
So you started when you were 16, did you say?

00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:00.820
Yes, well 15 really.

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:04.820
And then I was 15, left school at 15.

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:08.820
I did my 12 months in Cardwells.

00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:11.820
And then I went with Lawroches.

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:17.820
And then you were saying when you were younger, you were a bit afraid to speak back to your boss.

00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:19.820
Did that change over your working life?

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:20.820
Only now.

00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:21.820
All right.

00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:22.820
For about 10 years.

00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:23.820
Is it?

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:24.820
Yes.

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:26.820
So in Lora Ashley as well, you were quite...

00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:30.820
You would accept whatever they said.

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:32.820
Were you ever treated unfairly, do you think?

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:34.820
No, never.

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:36.820
Never.

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:38.820
Do you think you would have spoken up if you had been?

00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:41.820
I don't suppose I would have then, please.

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:45.820
No, I don't think I would have.

00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:47.820
No.

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:49.820
You just get on with it.

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:52.820
And accept it, and that's it.

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:55.820
And what did your husband and your family think about your working?

00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:56.820
Were they happy that you worked?

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:57.820
Yes, yes, fine.

00:50:57.820 --> 00:50:59.820
They wouldn't have preferred you to be back in the house?

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:00.820
No, no.

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:02.820
We all worked then.

00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:09.820
I mean, you were so lucky to have a quarter to three job.

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:13.820
Very, very good for that.

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:16.820
If you could have afforded it, do you think you would have preferred to stay at home?

00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:19.820
Yes, I think you would have.

00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:23.820
But there was nothing much to do in the village, you know.

00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:24.820
In Cardinal, was that?

00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:26.820
Yes.

00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:29.820
So it was quite nice to go out to work.

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:30.820
Right.

00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:33.820
And your children were at the local school then, weren't they?

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:35.820
Local school, yes.

00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:39.820
Yes, that's gone now.

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:42.820
Okay, then Mo, thank you very much for that.

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:43.820
You're welcome.

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:45.820
I don't know what you can make out of it.

00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:59.820
That's one of the first dresses, and it was like two tea towels.

00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:04.820
But instead of cutting it into a tea towel, they cut it longer.

00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:09.820
And then we just scooped the neck and the armholes and we sewed them.

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:11.820
It's shift dress. It's a shift dress.

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:16.820
But it's a mini dress though, isn't it?

00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:18.820
Well, no, it's not.

00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:20.820
Ah, it says knee length.

00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:24.820
And that's you wearing it.

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:27.820
So did they give you that or did you make it for yourself?

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:29.820
I made it for myself, most likely.

00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:32.820
I made it for myself, more than likely.

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:34.820
Do you remember how old you were in that photograph?

00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:39.820
I was married.

00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:40.820
Right.

00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:44.820
I was 17, 18.

00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:47.820
So you just started mailing Laura Ashley.

00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:49.820
Yes, I got married when I was 19.

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:52.820
So that's in between then somewhere.

00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:54.820
And where is that taken?

00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:56.820
That's outside my mum and dad's house.

00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:57.820
Is it?

00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:58.820
Yes.

00:52:58.820 --> 00:52:59.820
Was that near the factory?

00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:02.820
Yes, not far, in the village.

00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:04.820
That's outside the factory.

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:05.820
Okay.

00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:08.820
So you're in this?

00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:11.820
No, I'm not in there. My sister's in there, Rosina.

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:13.820
That's the one on the right?

00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:14.820
Yes.

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:16.820
Okay, and the other two?

00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:21.820
Well, that's her sister-in-law now and that's another girl that used to work there called Jennifer.

00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:23.820
Right. And this is the old factory, isn't it?

00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:25.820
That's the old factory.

00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:27.820
It's still there, you know. Standing.

00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:28.820
Is it?

00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:29.820
It's a mess.

00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:30.820
Right.

00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:34.820
But it's still there. It's an old, like I say, an old clubhouse that lost its license.

00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:39.820
And we used to come in and dole here. We used to sew here.

00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:41.820
Right. All behind those windows?

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:43.820
Yes, behind there.

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:45.820
So this is the back of the building, is it?

00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:46.820
That's the side.

00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:47.820
The side.

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:49.820
Yes, the side.

00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:51.820
So where are you looking out on if you're in the...

00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:52.820
Here, the main roads here.

00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:53.820
The main roads here.

00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:54.820
The main roads here.

00:53:54.820 --> 00:54:02.820
Yes. Yes. It's right on the main road when you're going through the village. It's halfway through the village and it's there.

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:04.820
Okay. So whose car are you sat on there?

00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:06.820
That's Bernard Ashley's.

00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:08.820
Did he know you used to sit on his sports car?

00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:09.820
I don't know.

00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:12.820
Do you remember what sort of car it was?

00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:14.820
It's a sports car. It's a lovely white.

00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:15.820
It's a soft top, isn't it?

00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:17.820
Yeah. Yeah.

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:20.820
So do you know these two other girls still?

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:21.820
Yes. Yes.

00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:23.820
Are they in Cardinale still?

00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:25.820
That one is. I'm not sure about that one.

00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:27.820
Okay, the one in the middle is.

00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:29.820
And that's your sister's?

00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:31.820
Sister, yeah. Sister-in-law.

00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:32.820
Sister-in-law.

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:35.820
Yeah. I don't know, but that's me there.

00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:38.820
You're on the right.

00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:39.820
Yes.

00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:40.820
Gosh.

00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:41.820
Is that...

00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:42.820
Showing legs.

00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:44.820
Were you at the factory then?

00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:46.820
Yes, sitting on the factory wall.

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:47.820
That's the factory wall, isn't it?

00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:49.820
Yes, the road is right behind us there.

00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:52.820
And the factory you were looking at there is up here.

00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:53.820
Right.

00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:55.820
And we're sitting on the factory wall there.

00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:57.820
So is this taken during a break?

00:54:57.820 --> 00:54:58.820
Must have been, yes.

00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:00.820
Or during a break or something.

00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:02.820
Looks like we're happy, doesn't it?

00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:03.820
It does.

00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:05.820
And the nylon overalls.

00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:06.820
That's what you're wearing there, isn't it?

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:08.820
Yes, the nylon overall.

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:12.820
So who were these other people?

00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:14.820
She was the secretary.

00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:15.820
Okay.

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:17.820
Like I say, I think most of them in the past.

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:18.820
Really?

00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:20.820
Do you remember their names?

00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:21.820
Yes.

00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:23.820
Jennifer, Anne and Glemis.

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:24.820
Glemis.

00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:25.820
That's it.

00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:27.820
Yes, I remember them all.

00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:33.820
And if I worked on a Saturday morning, I used to go to work with rollers and a headscarf.

00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:34.820
Did you?

00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:36.820
Ready for Saturday night.

00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:37.820
And did they allow that?

00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:38.820
Yes.

00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:39.820
Really?

00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:42.820
A head full of rollers and a scarf from my head on a Saturday night.

00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:44.820
It's a lovely photograph, isn't it?

00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:46.820
Black and white.

00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:50.820
Yes, the rollers used to be on a Saturday morning.

00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:51.820
Good work.

00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:53.820
So what else have you got there?

00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:54.820
That's the same.

00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:55.820
Okay.

00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:56.820
I've seen that.

00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:59.820
So this is, that's you again, isn't it?

00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:00.820
Yes.

00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:01.820
And whose car's that?

00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:02.820
Oh, I can't remember.

00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:03.820
So you've got a car.

00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:04.820
Yes.

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:05.820
And you've got a car.

00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:06.820
Yes.

00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:07.820
And you've got a car.

00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:08.820
Yes.

00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:09.820
And you've got a car.

00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:10.820
And you've got a car.

00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:11.820
Yes.

00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:12.820
And whose car's that?

00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:13.820
Oh, I can't remember.

00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:14.820
Whose car that is.

00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:15.820
There, Andy.

00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:16.820
And what was this?

00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:25.820
That was when they won the Queen's Award for growth of exports.

00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:27.820
And they gave us something.

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:28.820
I can't remember what we had.

00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:29.820
You had something.

00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:30.820
They gave all the staff.

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:31.820
I can't remember.

00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:35.820
Did we have money or what?

00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:39.820
So this is an invitation, is it, to that?

00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:41.820
Is it a celebration?

00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:44.820
No, we had something with this.

00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:45.820
I can't remember.

00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:47.820
Was it money or what?

00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:49.820
And that was with it.

00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:50.820
Right.

00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:53.820
And when was that?

00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:56.820
1977.

00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:58.820
1977.

00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:02.820
Now the Queen's Award.

00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:07.820
And is this?

00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:08.820
No, that's nothing.

00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:09.820
That's nothing to do with it.

00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:10.820
I don't think.

00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:13.820
That's just our Ruby anniversary.

00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:15.820
He lives in Cardinal.

00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:17.820
He worked for Laura Ashley.

00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:18.820
John Griffiths.

00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:19.820
John Griffiths.

00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:20.820
Where do you work the swans?

00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:24.820
They're in the back there, all together.

00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:26.820
And he's passed away now as well.

00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:28.820
There's my sister again there.

00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:29.820
OK.

00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:31.820
And this is outside the factory again?

00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:33.820
That's outside the factory again.

00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:37.820
Yeah, yeah, like I say.

00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:41.820
He used to do the printing after when he came in

00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:43.820
and he used to do a lot.

00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:45.820
We still see him quite often.

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:46.820
What's his name again?

00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:47.820
John Griffiths.

00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:48.820
John Griffiths.

00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:49.820
Yes.

00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:51.820
And he's got a beautiful house.

00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:52.820
They've all got beautiful houses.

00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:53.820
Have they?

00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:55.820
Or he worked for Laura Ashley.

00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:57.820
Did he have one on the plot?

00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:59.820
No, no, he did.

00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:01.820
What's his name?

00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:02.820
Oh, he's passed away now.

00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:04.820
He was one of the directors.

00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:05.820
All right.

00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:06.820
Myron Rawlins.

00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:12.820
He came from working on a farm and shearing.

00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:17.820
His mam and his sister used to work there

00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:20.820
and they were desperate in the factory one day

00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:22.820
and he said to Bernard Ashley,

00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:25.820
well, I don't know nothing about sewing and material.

00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:29.820
He said, you shear sheep, don't you?

00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:31.820
Yeah, well, you can use a scissors.

00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:33.820
So that's how he got it.

00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:34.820
Really?

00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:35.820
And he was a director in the end.

00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:36.820
Oh my gosh.

00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:37.820
He took to it then.

00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:38.820
Yeah, yeah.

00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:39.820
He was brilliant.

00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:41.820
So did the farm go under or did he just?

00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:43.820
No, he used to work farm hand.

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:44.820
Oh, okay.

00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:45.820
Yes.

00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:46.820
Yeah.

00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:48.820
So he said you can use a shears,

00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:51.820
shears, scissors, you know, you can use a scissors.

00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:53.820
So that's how Myron came in there.

00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:54.820
The whole caboodle came.

00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:55.820
Whole family.

00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:56.820
Yeah.

00:58:56.820 --> 00:59:00.820
The whole family, from grandad to everybody.

00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:02.820
Everybody gone on.

00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:04.820
They were fine.

00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:08.820
But I mean, I only worked there really

00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:11.820
and we didn't work in the big factory for long.

00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:15.820
But it was like family there.

00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:16.820
Yeah.

00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:17.820
Yeah.

00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:19.820
Everybody looks very happy in the photographs.

00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:20.820
Yes.

00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:21.820
Definitely.

00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:22.820
Yes.

00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:26.820
And I mean, when he passed away, you know, they...

00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:27.820
Which one?

00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:32.820
Bernard, Ashley, Jane, the daughter,

00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:37.820
they'd asked John, could he contact a few of the old ones, you know,

00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:41.820
and we were quite near the front.

00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:43.820
Oh, you know, we did hear.

00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:44.820
Yeah.

00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:45.820
Did hear.

00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:49.820
And they invited us all back to Ryder after to the house.

00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:50.820
Oh my gosh.

00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:52.820
So you never forgot.

00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:53.820
Yeah.

00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:54.820
You never forgot you.

00:59:54.820 --> 01:00:02.820
Oh, I put the nice cup, a nice one of the other cups out down there more than...

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:04.820
More than...

01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:08.820
And like I say, well, that's one of their perfumes, an old one.

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:09.820
Ashley perfume?

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:10.820
Yes.

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:11.820
It's horrible.

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:12.820
Oh, is it?

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:14.820
It's old, that one.

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:16.820
And I've got their...

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:19.820
They came to our wedding as well.

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:22.820
And they've written in here somewhere.

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:26.820
Oh my gosh, thank you.

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:32.820
I'd put my Ola Caili mug so.

01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:34.820
You know Ola Caili?

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:36.820
She's in the paper today actually.

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:38.820
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:41.820
From Cambridge.

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:44.820
She's wearing one of her dresses.

01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:45.820
Oh, really?

01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:46.820
Well...

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:47.820
Sorry, can we just...

01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:48.820
Oh, that's just...

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:50.820
I can't remember where they've signed it now.

01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:52.820
They've signed it somewhere.

01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:54.820
Bernard and Laura Ashley.

01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:55.820
I'll read it.

01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:56.820
Let me just scan that if...

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:57.820
It's small.

01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:58.820
Is it small?

01:00:58.820 --> 01:00:59.820
I can't.

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:00.820
But is that...

01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:01.820
That's our wedding.

01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:03.820
Oh, there it is.

01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:04.820
There, look.

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:05.820
Oh my gosh.

01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:06.820
You can't see it.

01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:07.820
Oh, I can see it.

01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:08.820
Can you?

01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:09.820
Yes, I can.

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:10.820
Oh, I can't.

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:11.820
I don't know.

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:12.820
I can scan this.

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:13.820
It's too...

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:14.820
It's too small.

01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:16.820
I can take a photograph of it then.

01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:17.820
Oh, that's what I need to do.

01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:18.820
I need to take a photograph of you.

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:19.820
Sorry.

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:20.820
Oh, God, Blimey, no.
