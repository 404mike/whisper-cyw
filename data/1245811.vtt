00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
looking for someone?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
yes

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
how do you go about

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
looking for someone?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
how have you met all your other

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
partners you've discussed tonight?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
school, college

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
friends

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
this time

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I haven't got a clue

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
whether it's

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
socializing

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
or

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I haven't got a clue

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
do you go anywhere at the moment?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
no

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
because

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the buses are outwards

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
right

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
public transport is a problem for you

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
where would you like to go

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
to meet somebody?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
in town

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
in Newport

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
do you know what sort of places

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
you should go to to meet somebody?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Westbrook, cinema

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
pizza

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
coffee shop

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the market

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
that sounds like some good ideas

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that are done
