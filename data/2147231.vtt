00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So first things, if you could just tell us your name and where and when you were born.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Tell us your name, where were you born and what date were you born?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
My name is Shafqat Rasool. I was born in Pakistan.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Born in Pakistan.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
When were you born?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I was born in the year.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Roughly, your name and passport?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I was born in the year of the passport.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I was born in 1972.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I was born in 1973.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
She doesn't know the year. At that time there were no certificates.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Some girls I knew they had a block.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
They had no certificates.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So 1972, 1973.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
What do you remember about the area that you grew up in?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
What do you remember about the area that you grew up in?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
There were many things.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The house, the family.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The family was together.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
My father was a teacher.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
My father was a teacher.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
When we had vegetables, fruits and vegetables, my father was fond of working.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
They had servants basically to look after the farm and fresh vegetables.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
All the vegetables they had grown from there.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
They had so much actually that they would give it to the neighbors.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
All the fruit and fresh vegetables.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The whole family was very fond of working.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The whole family was very fond of working.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
There were many guests.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
There was a big family.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
There were a lot of visitors.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
A lot of people would be visiting them.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I remember a lot of memories.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
A lot of memories.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:10.000
All the girls would get together and go out and talk at night.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
You were very fond of the village.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Yes, very fond.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We had a lot of love and care for each other.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
They were all people.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Even if they were not related, it seems like they were related.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
They were not blood related, but they were very close.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
We would go out and talk.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
We would go to the village every month.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
In summer holidays, she remembers that she would go to grandparents.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Like summer holidays, when they were off from school.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Like one month with the grandparents.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
They used to have fun together there.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
The nannies would come to drop them back to the parents.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Is there a favorite memory from being there or a favorite memory that you have?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
There was a bloodbath.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I used to walk with them.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
My elder grandmother used to come to the farm.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
She used to go to the farm with her.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I remember her very well.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I think it was a pole hole.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Now they do it electronically.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Before that, they used to have that.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
She remembers that.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
When my mother came to Eid, my grandfather was a poor man.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I remember that.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
She was very young, but she still remembers her granddad coming on Eid.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Bringing Eid to the daughter, which is her mom.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
It's a tradition during Eid events.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Parents will bring special gifts and money to their daughter and grandchildren.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
She said, I still remember that.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
She can visualize.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
She said every weekend, her and her other sister, a maid will go with them.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
They will take a lot of fruit and vegetables for the grandparents and grandmother to go and see her every weekend.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
They will go from school.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
It was near when the meal was two meals.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
About a meal and a half.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Did you walk with them?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
They used to walk.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
It was very safe.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
They walked to the grandparents.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
They used to walk to the grandparents.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
They used to walk to the grandparents.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
It was very safe.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
They walked to the grandparents' house, which is mom's side.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
What made you come to the UK?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I got married.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
I got married and came here.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
When was this?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Do you remember when you got married?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I don't remember.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
How many years have you been married?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
It's been about 50 years.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
55 years ago.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
She can't remember the year, but about 55 years ago.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
How old was she?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
She was 18.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
She was 18.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
When I came to Karachi, I was in Egypt.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I was from Karachi.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
I was from Karachi.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
From Karachi to Egypt.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
My sister was there.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
She stayed there for two weeks.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Did your uncle stay there?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Yes, he stayed there.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
From Egypt, they spent two weeks in Egypt.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Because one of her sisters was there.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Then they came to the UK.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
They came from Egypt.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
They were from the government.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Egypt, okay.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Because her husband was sent with the military or something in Egypt.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
So they thought to go and stay with them and then come to the UK.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
When we came here, we didn't have any weapons.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
We had a lot of weapons.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
We had a train.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
She said they had a train.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Where did they take the train?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
London.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
They had a flight probably to Heathrow.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Then they had a train from Heathrow to Newport.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
She said it was very cold.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Very cold and dark.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
It was very cold.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I didn't know the weather was like that.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
It was not like this weather is better for them actually.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
But she said when they came, it was very bad.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
It was very hard.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
They had no water.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
No carpet.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
No washing machine.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
No washing.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
So everything was washed.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Hand wash clothes.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000
They used to have the napkins for the children.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
We washed with our napkins and all that.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
There was no light.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
There was no light inside.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
There was no light outside.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Outside.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Outside.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And what was the end?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
There was a garden.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
The entrance was inside.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
It was very cold.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
So they used to stop at the entrance.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
It was not a door.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
It was a door.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
It was inside but it was outside.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
It was within the household but it was right outside.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
There was a park.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
There was a big tub.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
There was a big tub.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
We took the water from there.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
I was there.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I was there.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
We had to keep the water in the tub.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
It was very hard.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
It was very hard.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Very very hard.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
It was 10 pounds per month.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
It was 10 pounds per month.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
It was 10 pounds per month.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
It was 10 pounds per month.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
One pound was enough.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
One pound obviously the whole of the grocery was included.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
One pound was enough.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
There was plenty of milk.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
There was plenty of bread.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Bread was very thin.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
It was very thin.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
It was just a shling.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
It was just a shling.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
There was fire in the wood.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
There was fire in the wood.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
When fire would come I would cry my heart out.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
When fire would come I would cry my heart out.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
When she came here, she put the fire and burned.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
She used to be very upset and crying.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
She said they've never done that in Pakistan.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:02.000
She said she's out and put the food in.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.000
No carpet.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
They used to have a cardboard.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:19.000
She used to walk the kids.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
She used to walk.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Uncle used to come to work.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
She used to take the kids to school and she'd go and get them.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Even when uncle used to come for lunch break at home,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
she used to make sure that the food for lunch time is ready.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
She used to go and pick the kids for the evening meal for the children.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
She said it was very easy.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
I was very surprised.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I was very surprised.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
I don't know how many new things she had.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Imagination of the British.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
As they say, the Windrush people say that they thought somebody would be there to welcome us.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
This is how she imagined.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
When she came here, she said it was completely like they were calling us here to work.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
It was completely left on your own.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Especially when the women are coming at a young age and having families.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Not knowing the English.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
What they imagined Britain wasn't like that.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
They used to think, what is Britain?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
What would be like Britain?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
When you came, it was very different.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
She said when I came, she was related.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
She is Samina Lewis's mum.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
She is related as well.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
She said I got married long time after she came.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
They had a lot of facilities by the time I came here and got married.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
But their life was very hard.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Looking after the children, keeping the house warm, giving them baths.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
They had only one room to put the fire.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
They couldn't afford it.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
There was no hot water.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
No hot water.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
The sun didn't hit us.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
No fridge.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
As she said already, no fridge.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
No freezer.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
There were no clothes.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
They couldn't put the clothes out.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Especially in winter.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
They had to make sure that they were in that room where the fire was on.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
They had to make sure that they were in that room where the fire was on.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
It was very hard.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
She said obviously the generation like it would be.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
The one after me, they got a much easier life.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Because when they came, they had no parents.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
When I came, I was lucky.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
They had a family.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
They had no body.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
But our children or grandchildren will have their parents here.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
So we are getting that path.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Maybe a little bit easy.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Fingers crossed hopefully for them.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Definitely because you come in that early and lay a foundation for the next generations to be at ease in the way that they have it.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
When you came, you said that your life was very hard.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
We had no children.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
We were left behind.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
We were the only ones who could do the work.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
You had to work hard.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
We had to work hard.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
But the children were doing the work.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
There was no telephone.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
We had to write letters.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
I had to write letters.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
You could understand some of the letters.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
You had to wait for the letter.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Eight days to get there.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Eight days.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
There was a telephone outside.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Then later on, the pay phone.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Then slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Then obviously people started having telephones.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
And then we had to book the call as well.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
We had to book the call when we got our phone.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
It was not a direct call at some point.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
There was no phone in the kitchen.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
There was no telephone.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
There was only a cooker.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
There was no microwave.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
There was no kitchen.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
There was no microwave.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
There was only the cooker.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
There was no reason to do anything.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
There was no microwave.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
There was no kitchen.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Small kitchen.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Small kitchen.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
People saw that.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
They said, Pakistan is so bad.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
She said, coming here.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
I thought, oh my God, we were so bad off in Pakistan.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
We were so bad off at that time when we came here.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
We were so bad off.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
I was so embarrassed.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
You know, I think because you imagine things when you're young.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
You've got this different picture of UK.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
The life will be like this and that.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
You watch movies.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
It's completely different to reality.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Especially for working class people.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
What did you miss the most then?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
There might have been a lot anyway.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
What do you remember missing?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
You know, you miss a lot of things.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
What do you miss the most?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
What did you miss the most?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
I miss my sister.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
She was sick.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
She said someone is ill if death happens.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
We miss our sisters.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Our parents passed away.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
We miss our country.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Everything is here.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Regardless, we are here actually.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
But your own country is like when we say back home.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
But it is back home, isn't it?

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
This is our house.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
This is what we lived.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
More of our life.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
But she did miss the most.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Her family.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
The family system.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Love and care.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Also, they were very isolated.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
There was a bathroom and a bathroom outside.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
I was like, where are you taking me?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
I was so old.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Our life is very different.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Regardless what they talk about Pakistan media,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
if I'm honest, the life she is saying is much better in Pakistan.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
If you are middle class people, you have a big house

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and every bedroom has a bathroom.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
So much luxury, you can have beds.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
They have a social life as well.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Here it is much better.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
My mum came and she was there.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
My dad obviously worked in the shop.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
He was from a good family.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
But then I think when our parents came here to visit us,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
my mum hated me seeing working and coming home

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
and doing the cooking and all that.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Is that the same?

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Yeah.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Did your friends or family come over as well?

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
When they saw us, they saw us.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
They had to do everything there.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
They laughed a lot.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
When they told us to clean the house,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
I told them to clean the house.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
We cleaned the toilets as well.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
We cleaned the clothes, the dishes, the dishes.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
They have made everything basically.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Here you have to do everything yourself.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
And people do actually.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Not in a bad way they laugh.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
They appreciate that they are better off there.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
But we do believe as I already said,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
where we are going to go, we will be there.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
They came from Koshni.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
When they came, it was very hard.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Very tough and hard.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Did they come together?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
They came when they were 8 years old.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
They were 8 years old.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Who was he?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
He came with his uncle.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
That's quite interesting.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
He studied here.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
He went back to Shantaroh for the first time.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Uncle came, her husband, sorry I just need to say uncle.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
He passed away.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:07.000
He came when he was 8 years old with his uncle.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Which was dad's brother.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
He was in Newcastle.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
He died.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.000
This is how he was brought here when uncle was 8 years old.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
He grew up here.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Then he went back to Pakistan to get married when she came here.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Despite having those roots here,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
like his uncle was here,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
even still when he got married and brought her here,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
still there were difficulties.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
As you mentioned roots,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000
what elements of the culture or the roots did you make an effort to preserve?

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
You mentioned that you used to meet families there.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
What are the things that you try to preserve?

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
What are the things that you still try to preserve?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Whether you find it here or not.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Or any other festival that you do.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
The same thing that we do.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Or do you do it the same way?

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Here we do it the right way.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
We give food to the children.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
We give food to the children.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
We give food to the children.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
We try to do it.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
We give food to the children.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
On the weekend,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
the parents will have grandchildren visiting all of them,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
coming to one house.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
It's an opportunity for all the brothers.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Everyone gets married and they've got their own houses.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
They try to get together at one weekend to the parents' house.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
The children go there.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
They go to the houses.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Even our children have been to Pakistan and they loved it there.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Even Zinia says to me,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
why did you marry my dad?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
I said, sorry, it's too late now.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
40 years ago.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
I'm just going to change the memory card on here.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
And then we've just got one more section.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
But I'll just bring that card in here now.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
I have one more question.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
I was just thinking about, as you mentioned,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
you took your children to Pakistan as well.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Why was that important for them to be able to see home?

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
They asked you about your children.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Yes, they wanted to go.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Why did they want to go and see that our parents are there?

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
All the parents are there.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
They want to see their home.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
They've got their own houses.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Their dad passed away in Pakistan.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
But even before that, they wanted to go and see their aunties and uncles,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
which is mom's brother and sister.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Not all of them are in the UK.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
So it's good for them to go and see their aunties, uncles, cousins, extended families,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
and even the grave of grandparents.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
And our dad is buried there as well.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Sometimes they want to kind of connect to the roots as well.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
They go to the village.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
They want to see.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
They pick up the animals there.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
It's nice.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
It's very relaxing.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
You know, when they do the cane, sugar cane,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
they really love it.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
It's like how the parents or grandparents have lived here.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
It's nice for them to know.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Sometimes the media doesn't kind of help.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
But it is great, actually.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
It's a good break for them to go.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
They don't go because they can't work.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
It's true, actually.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
The people like, you know, they don't go to the village.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
It's true, actually.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
The people who are enjoying their life are in Pakistan.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
People sometimes say to me, go back.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Because my in-laws were here anyway, so I couldn't go back.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
If they had any house, I...

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
And I said to my daughter, what do we do?

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Do we sell probably somewhere, a stall, actually, in the middle of somewhere?

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Nobody will give me a job.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
It's the way they craft, you know.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
I know there are NGOs and all that, but it's just hard.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000
I mean, one thing I could say is I like, which I did not say,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
there is the things we should follow, you know,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:05.000
having like Christian, Muslims, respecting each other,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
systems, you know, like with the benefit system.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
It looks like they've taken it from Christianity and Muslims,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
that we were supposed to give the charity on our wealth and our belongings,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000
and that money should be used for poor people, widows and all that.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
And then also, you know, like how we stand in the queue,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
can't corrupt, actually.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
I can't give someone...

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
The bills, yeah, it starts to build.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
So these are the things that other countries, like my country,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
like if you say Pakistan, has, if I'm honest, actually,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
the worst and the corrupt government in the past.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
And this is where the poor is getting much poorer

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
and rich is, it doesn't matter to them.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Yeah, and it's a great opportunity to build communities

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
and for us to maintain like connections.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
And you mentioned earlier on about, yeah, one, definitely,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000
roots and stories and networks and communities.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
So how, yeah, just to bring it in, how is Age Alive?

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
How did you end up being involved in Age Alive?

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
It's like stay within the four walls.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
It's not easy, especially as...

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
She said she tries to keep herself alive,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
despite she's got the condition.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Just to, but she said coming out to the group,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
it does help us to share.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Yeah, it's like it's their time, two, three hours,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
it's her time for herself being with the group.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
And what do you think about the time with Age Alive?

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Is there one or multiple events that you can remember?

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
What do you think about the time with Age Alive?

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Is there one or multiple events that you can remember?

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
You haven't been there for long, but do you remember

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
how many things you went to and how you felt good there?

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
When I came there, I was there.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
When you go to St Mary's, what do you like there?

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
The exercise, yeah.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
There was no exercise here.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
There was a lot of talking, and everyone was sitting in their bags.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
I think it's just sharing, sharing time, good time

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
with other people.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
I think that's the word.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
A cup of tea, a cup of tea, top of a tea, and yeah, it's nice.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
It's nice to gather, yeah.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000
I think she likes that, so you're not on your own.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
So coming to people and different local languages

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
is respecting each other and feel part of the group.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
And why is that important for black, Asian, or ethnic groups

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
over 50, why is that?

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Why is it important for us to go out and go to groups

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
or go somewhere where we can be respected and welcomed?

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Why is it important?

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
It's important because you think about it.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
You're upset at home, you're isolated, you're lonely.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
That's the reason.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.000
So it helps to deal with the isolation and loneliness.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
She said she does come to, she's only been for a couple of weeks ago,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
but she did say that she's got children who are obviously grown up,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
so she goes one day for one son, and then she'll go probably stay with,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
which is like a family, but it's nice to be part of the group

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
and of the same kind of ages.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
And it's different, you know, it's not like you're going to be

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
in a group for a long time, but you're going to be in a group

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
and you don't feel like someone will say something to you

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
and you'll be in different cultures.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Do you feel that way?

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
No, I don't feel like that.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
No, you're not in a group, right?

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
No, no, no.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
I think she feels comfortable that nobody will say anything

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
because of her color or because of how she dressed up

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
and what her background belief and you know, all that.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
So she feels that because we are all different, but we are all human,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
she feels that she doesn't have to experience any kind of,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
generally she hasn't experienced much of racism,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
but still being with the group, people from the levels,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
we understand each other better and sharing things.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Beautiful.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
And speaking of sharing, is there any family heirlooms

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
or photographs or ornaments that you have kept as well?

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Do you have any family heirlooms that you can share with us

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
or have kept in your own hands?

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
I have kept some old things, like this one.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Anything else? Any photographs?

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Yes, I have a lot of photographs.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
She said that...

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Yes, I have kept them in my hand.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
This is tradition.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
She said they grew up, she said they got rid of all the ornaments

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
and decorations and stuff, but she said the good thing

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
she's got memories is the photographs.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
A lot of photographs.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Why are they important to you?

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
For what is the photo important?

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
When the children were small, they didn't have any problems.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
When they were small, they grew up.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
They had a child.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.020
They were like the

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.020
children of the olden days.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.020
They were small.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.020
She's got the photograph of her own children.

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.020
Her grandson is even married.

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.020
He's got a little baby as well.

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:21.020
It's nice when they come to show them

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.020
the childhood of children and even grandchildren

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:28.020
will have a look at the photos of their parents and grandparents.

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:31.020
It's a good memory to remember.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.040
Sometimes they come to see the photos.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.040
Yes, they do.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.040
Sometimes you're sitting there and you're thinking

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.040
what shall I do?

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.040
You just go into the drawer and start looking.

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:45.040
All the photos of their parents, their sisters,

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:49.040
those who passed away, those who are with them.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:53.040
It's just reminding all the good memories and good time

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.040
they had as a family.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.040
Beautiful, huh?

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.040
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.060
I think I'll ask.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:04.060
Auntie said she'll go now.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:07.060
So you can carry on what you need to do.
