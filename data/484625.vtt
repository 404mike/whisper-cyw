00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.240
Thank you very much indeed.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.440
When did you first come across the Cardiff Mass Carnival?

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:11.720
I first came across the Carnival in the Christopher 500 years of resistance, Columbus.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.760
I just happened to be in town just wandering around and this just came up.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.960
Man real business.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.400
And along I just came to the haze and just saw this just colour and noise that just came straight

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.120
up the road to the haze and I was just blown over actually by the whole thing, the spectacle of it

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.440
and you know these huge, huge structures.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.560
You know I think one of them was my best was the famous, was the in the boats, all the boats,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.000
all the people in the boats, I thought that was fantastic and just the fact that you know you

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.240
could use that and people were moving with it and just and I was moving with it as well so

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.320
that was my first definitely my first experience of carnival and then from there I thought I got

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:07.720
to get involved with this so joined the the Samba band and started clicking away on the old

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.000
what they called?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.640
Go Go Bells?

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.920
Go Go Bells that's the one.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.720
It's okay.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.640
Go Go Bells. Go Go Bells were the first thing I did yes every Sunday evening and that's how I started.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.120
Yes it was amazing.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.040
How about you Sally what was your first point of contact?

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.280
I mean it's almost a shared experience definitely by being a spectator and witnessing

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.960
and seeing it and like Jane said that the right world is spectacle there

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.720
but and I feel like my memory is failing me and I don't know what order this all happened in

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.360
but because I came to work at Rubicon I was very aware then and I and because I came to

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.200
meet with Jane I was very aware of the carnival but I also got involved with dancing with

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.920
Sally McLennan and my Adrian ran the Samba band and she set up a dance group for it

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.080
and I really can't remember in what order it all happened but I was a participant of one of the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.960
carnivals and I think...

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.240
Was the last one called the Tarzan Angels or something like that?

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.200
Oh yeah that was another one but yeah that's interesting yeah.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.700
Right.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.920
I was dancing with June and Sally and Tracy and myself and then Adrian did some music for us as

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.800
well yes yeah so that was kind of an offshoot actually yeah and that was just not very much

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.440
about dancing in the street and for festivals but yeah no so I was a dancer with Sally's group

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.320
and we danced with the Samba band and so I was a participant in the carnival soon after as well

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:41.160
before becoming involved in the making of it but yeah for me it's just yes I think it's something

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.320
and I think I'm quite selfish about this if you see something like that you want to be in it

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.960
rather than observing it and so I was delighted when I became involved in it yeah.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.840
You've both been I think working as a team really wasn't it as animators actually

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.640
trying to help put the bullet in the gun of actually yes I mean you know nine tenths of the

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.880
iceberg is the making of costumes but if on you know come the big day come the day of actually

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.200
showing the work if the costumes aren't kinetic if the dance groups don't dance

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:24.600
with joy then we have no carnival so 1994 at Kittays Community Center you'd have been part

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.960
of the teams then I think I was there as I came in as part of the team then that was when I first

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.440
came that was my first year yes it was yeah and of course that we wouldn't have had a specific

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.520
dance space for it wasn't a specific dance space and it was basically just right everybody wants

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.360
to move we're doing it here now at this point in time and then we had maybe a couple of drummers

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.560
and that was Chris was there that time as well Chris Chris yes that's right and we just

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.480
just gathered everybody together who wanted to dance whether they were going to be dancers in

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.520
or not they would all have to move at some point the music and we just did these huge I remember

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:11.800
huge sessions it was quite impressive and we just took over the space basically and then everyone

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.600
making as it goes to the next space or people making were around the space and yeah that first

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.880
year was quite um having seen hundred years of resistance be 500 years of resistance before

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.880
in the year before it was almost like you've gone part of it but also it's this whole thing

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:36.920
about getting people participating and that's what I enjoyed about it you know just encouraging

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:44.600
people who perhaps haven't moved at all just to step yeah do a few steps and um and feel

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.760
comfortable doing it and just letting themselves go because that I mean obviously carnival that's

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.600
what it's about it's expressing yourself through music and being somebody else maybe for that day

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.560
and if you can help them move within their costume to do that then that's

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.600
yeah that would be a good thing yeah I also have memories of almost collecting people

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:12.440
and it's it's that idea of yes there would be advertised a dance workshop would be going on

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.600
but actually that to me isn't part of what carnival's about it's not this separate thing

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.760
and so actually people would be in the space making joining some people would be dropping in

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:26.040
off of the street literally and all dropping out actually became part of it and it was it was almost

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:32.040
processional in the making you do they disappear they come back so yeah and again that's what's so

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.560
lovely about it it isn't about this advertised thing you come and you do this actually one minute

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.080
you're making one minute you're joining in and yeah there's a fluidity about it well there was

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.120
we talk a lot about access and being inclusive it seems to be that bubble it you know had no

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.400
there's no membrane for people to you know provided they could actually come through the door

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:58.360
yeah they were welcoming and it used to because on I think that's just it and it was all the mass

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.240
camps were in the summer and in those lovely moments when it is sunny in Cardiff I think it

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:09.880
used to spill out didn't it yeah it wasn't just it was spill outside yes yeah yeah but I've got

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.120
memories as well as sometimes the workshops literally happening outside they did yeah yeah

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.480
I was especially when chap today was a lot outside and and it's and also the fact that you know

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:25.000
families would come together and let you get a family dancing especially I mean each kind of

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.680
was different because of the different people that took part in it but quite often there was

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.080
lots of that's what I enjoyed was the family sessions where you'd have everybody have mum dad

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:39.720
grandma if you might be you never know granddad not many grand dads but you know you know but

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:46.680
everybody just having a go that's what I enjoyed about that's quite a lot of memories especially

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:51.560
when we had our children as well I was just about to say our children came around yeah yeah

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:56.280
because we had them yeah they were really young weren't they at that time and they used to get

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.320
I mean they still remember it now so they wake up screaming

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:08.520
no they do they do remember it and they always remember it oh you know remember I used to because

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.760
I always thought well am I dragging them along or they do they want to come along or it's mum

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.000
doing what she does and getting embarrassed by me and things like that but no they've got really

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.960
positive memories and and I think um yeah definitely well for me and it also it forms part of my only

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:30.440
memories of their life yes it really does and because the first carnival I was in because I

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:36.840
was too attached to my children I Laurie was on my back in a in a holder so I danced the whole thing

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:42.680
and made me sorry can we get this now I um went away on holiday and then discovered I was pregnant

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.440
with Finn and then he came along to the next carnival and that's when Natasha looked at so

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.920
Natasha used to look after Finn because it was it wasn't just you know you were there all the time

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:57.400
you were there all the time so you'd have someone to look after them or just to give an eye on them

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:03.960
and we're doing your bit yeah we were looking at photographs recently because Laurie the one

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:09.240
that was on my back is now 22 and and he had remembered his experience and we were getting

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.720
out photographs to show his girlfriend and we found photographs of him with really long hair

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:22.600
and being a monkey did he have a red fez on no no some of the monkeys did yes no he didn't

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:28.040
no he didn't he had long blonde hair and a tail and a monkey face yeah yeah yeah so I was thinking

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:34.600
but it is but I think that's what Jane just said it isn't just about it's a whole family

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:41.400
experience and it is it connects with people and brings out something from I think I really do

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:48.280
the I mean obviously uh parading has been a constant over the past 25 years there's always

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:53.880
been a you know a parading element and the route has changed over the years and the staging again

00:09:53.880 --> 00:10:01.960
has changed over the 25 years but we've just watched a video looking at an ending which went

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:07.000
onto the haze for a bit of a party but that happened on the steps of the National Museum

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.120
of Wales before they put in the handrails which certainly facilitate access for those

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:20.760
with mobility problems but actually took away our stage from us um looking at the video I mean

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:26.840
the groups do look highly choreographed I mean you were clearly involved in all that I mean I can

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:31.080
remember you coming through coming on walkthroughs and the rest of it and we'd be there certainly I

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.880
my mind's like the two of you were pointing and and sort of doing some steps up here and

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.960
on this podium well the following will be happening is it is this all true have I made it all up

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:46.440
I think there was a whole when we started there was a parading and then with it was a vision I

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:53.320
think of Amaru really thinking about this idea of having carnival theatre telling a story telling

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:59.000
a story and and I think that was part of it so you had the element which was moving around but

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.800
actually it was it was thinking about what what were those costumes about what was underlying

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:10.120
what message what what was the theme and underneath it and trying to to replicate that in a sort of a

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:18.360
theatre theatre context I suppose but yeah and to some extent it it worked and then to other

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:28.760
extents everything went into chaos so so I mean the idea so it was like so I don't know whether

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:37.240
we actually got to that point where it it sort of found a sort of a you know a space a happy

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:43.560
yeah happy middle ground and maybe maybe it's something still to be explored I don't know

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:49.720
it's interesting because Jane used the absolute word for me that something came out of the chaos

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:54.600
but and I actually think for us we have a picture in our head but not not a definite it wasn't about

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.880
people being having to be there and I think just in watching back actually is what I saw going on

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:04.120
there's a lot of connecting visually with people and then having that moment of dancing with them

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:09.560
and there was a very very loose structure and selfishly I kind of remember that I was doing a

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:14.840
water section and so we literally used that idea like you said earlier the fluidity will allow it

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:20.520
to be what it is and we had moments of spiralling like you know the idea of water and waves and

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:25.320
fall them back but I can remember the eco I definitely remember the eco mass because there

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:30.840
was that I think that's when it came in the height of putting together some kind of a story it was a

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:36.520
very complex story to it so I remember Amara had it in his head what it was going to be and I had

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.720
little snippets of it and then all of a sudden he said right Jane okay so we know what we're

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:47.160
going to do now I'm going yes and he said because I'm going to go on the stage now and drum so I had

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:52.280
no clue what was going on I had little snippets and then I'm trying to herd people on and then

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.360
people coming off and then people going on and actually not wanting to leave the space so I think

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.800
oh there we are that's it that's where they are that's fine that's okay you didn't get out of

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.160
with and drive them off the steps or something no exactly because they were right in the zone

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:10.600
Amara was in the zone and everybody's in the zone so that was fine but the idea behind it the

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.960
actual story was very very and maybe that's okay then maybe that's just what it needs to be

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:21.400
you know it doesn't need to be any more than that so that I think that was the the most ambitious

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:25.240
one I'm sure that was most ambitious one I want to think I'm just trying to give some of the other

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:31.240
ones but that was when we had the stage as well didn't we we had the steps in the stage and we

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.560
had a flat back lorry because we wanted we needed to we needed to extend it because we were trying

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:42.760
harder to tell whether to be some received meaning yes yeah and I think you know I think it it works

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:48.760
I you know but but do you know it's your perception of what this thing would be we don't I just think

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:53.720
I think that was what's the main thing what what's the performance going to be like and I don't think

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:58.360
it's about taking away the fact that there was a narrative there but actually the whole carnival is

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:03.240
visual is a spectacle and people watching they make up their own stories and actually as a

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.800
participant in it you make up your own story and especially when you're in that moment you really

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:14.200
do yes I've got to say that takes me off on another journey we were really lucky to do workshops with

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:20.440
that guy from Billy's yes and well I will not even say workshops we were kind of experiences I think

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:25.080
that's the first time I felt like I was in a trance totally hypnotized because I think we danced in a

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:31.160
room non-stop for about three hours and yes it was here it was yeah and I actually came out of it

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:37.000
and felt like I had been transported into another space and it was amazing and and that is almost

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.560
something I wanted to be able to share with people allow yourself just to just to be there

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:46.120
and we've been using I've been using it ever since all that material I've been using ever since all

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:51.480
that sort of those traditions the those things he imparted on us which was to do with the music as

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:57.080
well in the rhythms and and yes no that was an that was a really and I don't do this easily but

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:02.040
it's actually getting in touch with your spiritual self and you did he did we were allowed to do that

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:11.480
in that moment and yeah transcending moment there we are if you had a I mean obviously it's a visual

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:20.120
feast carnival but if you had to pick your most striking costume may not be one that you wore

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.480
yourself may not even be one that you well you probably wrapped everything when you were there

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:31.400
what can yes what have you just come to your mind going down the street I mean oh going down the

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:37.080
street I the one that I really remember is when there was the opening for the world cup

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:44.840
that was I it was yeah I I just was there and there was all these people from different countries

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:49.800
or it was a South Africa and different places it was Argentina was the first one wasn't it

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:55.240
but there was lots of people there on the side I just remember just going dancing with was I what

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:59.640
I can't remember what I was wearing a load of daffodils yeah when we woke up we were going to be

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:05.080
loaded daffodils yeah there's bound to be that yeah yeah no no I think we were trying to side with subvert

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.560
stereotypes I hasten to act you know that was our plan but we were all coming down and just seeing

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:15.640
everybody coming down because as you came down past the castle there's a slight slope isn't there

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.480
and you could see everybody in front of you and everybody behind you you could just see everything

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:25.480
and it was just quite impressive I thought I thought that was a really strong memory most

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:33.880
definitely just because you know different audience is the dancing daft I think was in red actually

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:43.400
ah I know the picture of which you speak yes styrofoam yeah I think there's also something

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:48.600
about the scale though because there are there were some beautiful magnificent huge costumes

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.920
and to a certain extent actually the costume was the choreography of it because actually the person

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:57.320
within it just had to shift this thing along the street but then you had the contrast of the people

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.320
we're talking about earlier they're just body painted and actually that allowed for the freedom

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:06.360
of movement so it's just exactly it's almost like that they became the dancing costume themselves

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:12.040
and for me that's one of the strong memories actually yes yeah different kind of traditions

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:16.120
different different points of access different points of ways of expressing yourself really I

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:20.120
suppose variety it's got to be good it's got to be good I think the other the other memories is

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:27.080
is and that must be the same year in Swansea yeah the very first Swansea that was very special

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:35.400
I think it's special because of the place I don't know it just um yeah that was very special I think

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:42.440
it was very good that one yeah very uh I can't put my finger on why it was because it opened the door

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:46.680
in Swansea I think probably probably they've been dying out for some kind of public celebration

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:52.200
you know we showed them what they were capable of so enthusiastic they were so

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:57.000
open to everything and and uh yeah that was great

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:07.880
can I thank you both for your contribution those years ago and your eloquence now Sally and Jane

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:11.320
thank you very much indeed
