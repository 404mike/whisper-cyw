00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600
Hello, this is a project about memories and the people who used to live in Tiger Bay,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.840
Butown, Cardiff Docks.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:20.800
And first of all let me say thank you on behalf of us at HDA for Heritage Lottery for providing

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.240
us with some funding for this short project.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:36.880
This next conversation is with June Wagstaff and this is part one of three relatively short

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.600
clips 15 minutes odd with June.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:49.240
And let me apologize for the quality of the recording.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:57.040
Unfortunately because of Covid we had to do these conversations via mobile phone and

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.680
every now and then the quality is a bit of a problem and that was the case with this

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.680
interview.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.240
But I hope you can still hear her and I hope you still spend the time listening.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:21.880
She is an interesting character, a good person and part of what was the heart of the now

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.880
destroyed Tiger Bay.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:02:11.160
So, right, so you're born and brought up in Nelson Street, yes.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:19.560
Where were they from?

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.320
From the docks.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.320
And their parents?

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:34.120
My grandparents have been, my father's father was from Egypt and my mother's father was

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.120
from Dominica.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.080
So I got caught in the approach.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.080
That perfectly sums up the bay doesn't it?

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:52.080
You know one from Africa, one from the Caribbean, no chance they'd meet except in the bay.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.080
That's right.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.080
Yeah but I don't know if you could understand it.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.080
Everybody comes from now.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:09.040
Nobody settled up to value, said Gary was black or she was white or anything like that

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.040
you know.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.040
We were all so close.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.040
I suppose you've spoken to Gary and everybody have you?

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.040
Everybody, you know Karen Ali and others.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:27.240
But I mean what gets me, let me say my granddad arrived early 1900s from Barbados settled

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.240
in Bari.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:37.320
I get entirely what you're saying but do you think everybody got on, because everybody,

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:44.320
even the white working class people, a lot of them were kind of from somewhere else,

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.320
do you know what I mean?

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.320
From the valleys, from wherever.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:56.320
Well I can tell you my father's mother was from Dorset but my mother's mother was from

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.400
Grange Town.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:09.400
She had quite a few families there you know and we were just a lovely family.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:16.400
I never wanted to be anywhere else, I wasn't anybody else.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.400
My parents were workers so we never went anywhere else.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.400
People said they went without.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:29.480
Not a lot of people went without since I could be, because everybody helped one another.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.480
And you could always, if you were playing with one of the kids, one of the three diamond

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.480
arrows, you could have team one.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.480
And like those, they could have team nine.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.480
I always say I think the women used to cook for the street.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.480
Oh yeah, yeah.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:55.560
My grandmother used to, honestly, it would be either pancakes she'd be making,

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.560
you call them Ralph's Cheesecakes, we used to call them Baked Storms,

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.560
and she'd stand her always then doing a big plateful.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.560
And Victor Park had always used to watch him on a chat,

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.560
and my grandmother would be there, we were there when he'd be doing the bloody Baked Storms.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.640
That's the guitarist, isn't it?

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.640
Yeah, yeah, a bit of a legend, isn't he really?

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.640
Lovely, that's that. Lovely man.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.640
My grandmother used to listen to it, but I don't mind you, I love you,

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.640
but grandma's all my kids too.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.640
There were some characters down there that got off on now.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.720
That's just so excessive about it.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.720
Yeah.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.720
I mean, all the characters are gone.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.720
You know, a lot of the people live where they were born,

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.720
I don't know anybody wanted to leave.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.720
I mean, I've lived so many times.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.720
I've got three parents in the back,

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.720
one of them is a woman, I have good father's children,

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.720
I have the coachman, I have the wife, I have the judge.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.800
I've run up the valley for a few years and I've got that up there,

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.800
but I still love the dogs.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.800
You had quality pubs though, didn't you? Legend pubs.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.800
Well, they've been there too, I never used to close.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.800
Where's the cop closing?

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.800
I never used to close, and if I'd build up

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.800
and his daughter was going out in the night after closing,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.800
they'd say, where are you going?

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.880
I say nowhere, well, we're all dressed up.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.880
Well, I say it's nice to dress up, not when I can.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.880
I don't like to think I was going somewhere else.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.880
But you set the tone.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.880
You set the tone, you dressed up, you looked after yourself

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.880
and it said to all the customers,

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.880
there you go, me and you.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.880
Yeah, they gave a word to me, you know, at one time, in the pub.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.880
Yay, it was lovely.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.960
Did you have a lot of music played in your pub?

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.960
Oh, all live music, live music.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.960
I used to have a friend who used to have the Welsh Jazz Orchestra play.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.960
I used to play for free, but it was special every day

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.960
that I was out of steam.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.960
It used to be compact and they had plenty of musicians

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.960
coming from all over the place.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.960
Oh yeah, we had all kinds of music.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.960
Yeah, I love music.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.040
But I think musicians attract musicians.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:39.040
No one watches musicians better than other musicians.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.040
Musicians, that's right, yeah.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.040
I'm trying to be working in the museum

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.040
in the functionary or something, in my room this week.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.040
They come down, they do all the moon-making,

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.040
they're all on the clinic,

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.040
they've got the only time I could be there, you know?

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:59.040
And play what they wanted to play.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.120
Yeah, and I'm a bit of a singer myself, aren't we?

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.120
Are there?

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.120
I'm a singer, yeah.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.120
Yeah, I love your favourite music.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.120
I mean, I've seen Clank's Immaculate, High Time,

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.120
the Sixth Sense, you know, and I've done all of his songs.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.120
Shadowborn is my uncle.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.120
I've seen lots and lots.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.120
My musicals, of course, they're not as distilling

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.120
as anybody did then, but my lots are all gone, aren't they?

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.200
Yeah.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.200
I'm trying to get this black business.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.200
Why do they leave people alone?

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.200
I love my background, I love my race,

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.200
I love all the people I've got.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.200
Let me take you back a bit. What about school?

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.200
School?

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.200
Yeah, where'd you go?

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.200
Yeah, I went to Samaris of Virgin first,

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.200
and then they moved us up to Samaris New Terris.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.280
Well, my cousin and I were always together,

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.280
but my cousin was darker than me because her father was...

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.280
..he was from Barbados, I think.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.280
He died at three, got killed at three,

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.280
was a lovely, maroon-haired family.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.280
But my auntie Ella lived to over 100.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.280
So she was like, in Samaris, for a shop and that,

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.280
that was her family, but my grandmother was an auntie.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.360
Because my grandmother, well, the sister brought them up

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.360
because their mother died young.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.360
You know, and you might think it sounds funny,

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.360
but that's how close people are in those days.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.360
No, no, I get it entirely.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.360
My gran was the same.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.360
You know, if anyone...

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.360
And there's this thing about cousins

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.360
and whether cousins are family...

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.360
Oh, I have loads of cousins!

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.440
Yeah, you know, it's the people your mum knew,

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.440
your gran knew, they became...

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.440
Yeah, and everybody was wonderful and auntie.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.440
Yeah, and everybody...

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.440
If one of them, something happened to their parents

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.440
or whatever, they'd end up in your house

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.440
for a couple of years.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.440
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.440
We are the one who needs to call Auntie Peggy.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.440
She worked with my auntie, my mother's sister,

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.520
and a cousin who's gone married

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.520
and had a couple of kids, she was under,

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.520
and they were running a farm that I was supposed to leave.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.520
So she came to my auntie's house at home.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.520
And my granny and grandfather accepted her

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.520
like as if she was their own.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.520
I mean, she was with us, well, she's dead now,

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.520
but she was with us all of her life.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.520
Yeah.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.520
All of her life.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.520
And she was like a big sister to me with my auntie,

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.520
was like a big sister as well, my mother's sister.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.600
And they were there because they always went to work.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.600
You know, I'd never known about them.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.600
The social security, I argue.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.600
Because we always worked.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.600
I'd never been on social security

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.600
and I've never touched with my auntie.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.600
It's a funny thing, isn't it?

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.600
You weren't on the sick

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.600
and it wasn't anything to do with a boss or whatever.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.600
It was to do with your own self-respect.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.680
Oh, yes, yeah, exactly.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.680
Yeah.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.680
And my little brother, Dick McCoy,

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.680
he was a rugby referee.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.680
And his friend, he played in the band

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.680
and he was playing as well, and my uncle Jimmy did.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.680
So they would solve the music for the family.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.680
You know, like my grandson,

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.680
my eldest son, so he was playing today as well.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.680
He was a rugby.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.680
He was a winner, isn't it?

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.680
His name was Lewis the Summit.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.760
Oh, I knew it.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.760
Thank you so much, June.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.760
I've had this argument the other day.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.760
Despite the accent, I'm born in London,

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.760
but all my family are from Barry, yeah?

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.760
And that's what he spent all his growing up.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.760
I had an argument the other day with someone from England

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.760
who said, oh, Riz, he'll be from some middle-class family.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.760
Somewhere, I said, he's a baby boy.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.760
He's got to be a baby boy.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.760
And he said, no, no, no.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.840
He's not a baby boy.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.840
No, but I know what I mean.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.840
You have family stuff, family stuff.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.840
Yes.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.840
My son always went,

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.840
and he married a girl from Cathedral Road.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.840
And then when another and father were about to retire,

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.840
my son took over the hotel,

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.840
and he actually bought it off him.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.840
So he didn't get married to me this time.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.840
I think I met Joseph that night.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.920
And then we were in the hotel

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.920
and we were buying and selling a few cars.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.920
And we had a good education event at the Cathedral School.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.920
And also, we had a couple of boys that had a hand,

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.920
but they were big.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.920
But Lewis was a child in the sport.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.920
Yeah.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.920
So that's where Lewis's family came from.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.920
He's my grandson.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.920
The boy's going to be a legend.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
There's no two ways about it.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
But we've generated enough rugby legends,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
particularly from the Bay.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Isn't he just another one of those boys

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
whose blood comes from the Bay

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
who's shown it?

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
I mean, all of the rugby.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Now, at least he's playing rugby union for Wales.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
You remember all the boys who had to go north

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
to the rugby league.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Of course I do.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Billy Belfast, Bimmin, Johnny Freeman.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.080
Colin Dixon.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:43.080
The males would never have been able to tell it.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.080
Nah.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.080
You know?

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.080
And they were working.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.080
Because they said Lewis was incredible.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.080
And they were working men who had to make a living.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.080
Of course.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.080
I mean, today there is a sport

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.080
and they get fantastic money.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.080
But I don't know what the rugby players get.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.080
I don't ask, but I know footballers do.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.160
Well, you know, years ago they had jobs.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.160
And they played on a Saturday.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.160
You know, no sport can add jobs.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.160
Yeah.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.160
Yeah.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.160
I mean, people don't appreciate just how much

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.160
the Bay has contributed to sport.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.160
What with...

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.160
Oh, it was a lovely, lovely place to live.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.160
...the foxes that come from the Bay, the Erskine...

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.240
Well, Joey Erskine is like a cousin to me.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.240
Yeah.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.240
Yeah.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.240
And my grandfather lived with his nana.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.240
We would always...

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.240
My uncle Tate, the rugby referee,

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.240
was his father's best friend.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.240
We would go out together.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.240
And my mother and Johnny Aish,

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.240
my neighbour Kate, they were like brothers and sisters.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.240
My nana took care of all.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.240
She took my mother.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.240
So it's...

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.320
We were all mixed down there.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.320
It was lovely.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.320
I'm so glad I just got down there.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.320
I'm so happy.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.320
One of the things people talk about from school days

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.320
was wits and treats.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.320
Did you go on any of them?

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.320
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.320
Yeah, yeah.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.320
And when the school stopped doing it,

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.320
the kayak trucks started doing it.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.320
But it was always on August Bank all the time.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.400
One wits and then it was August.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:33.400
The church used to put on some lorries.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.400
You couldn't do it today.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.400
But you'd always put on the inspection of the lorries.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.400
You know, they weren't allowed to do it.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.400
Yeah, but for a kid, wow.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.400
It's exciting.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.400
It was fabulous.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.400
It was fabulous. It was.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.400
It was like a family home again.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.480
Don't worry, I can cut it out.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.480
Don't worry about it.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.480
But that thing about, for a kid from the bay,

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:07.480
being able to go somewhere to see a bit more green

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.480
was special.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.480
Although, of course, a lot of people will remember

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.480
the park in the middle of Loudoun Square.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.480
Oh, yeah.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.480
That's the town of Loudoun Square.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.560
Yeah, and it was lovely, the park.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.560
It made us feel happy, but very small.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:29.560
But that's what we had in the paddling core.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.560
You'd catch your feet every time you went in there.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.560
At least you had it, you know.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.560
I mean, a lot of the bigger boys used to swim in the canal

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.560
in the timber float.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.560
Lots of kids got downed there in the summer

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.560
when we were supposed to.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.640
But for future, I think a town would be nice.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.640
Canal.
