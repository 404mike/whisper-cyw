WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
You know me don't you?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Okay it's Friday the 9th of June, one o'clock.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Uh, present Mike Nicholson, Sue Nicholson and...

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Kevin.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Kevin Horder and...

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And Jess.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And Jess.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Bishop.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Jess Bishop.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Welcome guys.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Okay so Kevin, if we start with you, can you just tell us a little bit about yourself?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Maybe your name, where you come from and stuff like that.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Um, Living Bullock.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Living Bullock, which is in Chepstow.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Yeah.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You attend Chepstow Mencap, is that right?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
How long have you been coming to Chepstow Mencap?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
41 years.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
41 years?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
80, yeah, about 82.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
About 82, right, so nearly since the beginning then.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Half after the beginning.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And how about you Jess, where are you from?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Cardicat.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Yeah.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Sorry.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I don't know, that's fine.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And you attend Chepstow Mencap, is that right?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Mmm, I don't know really, it must be a long time ago.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Looks like I can't remember.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Oh, how long you've been coming, yeah?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
It's been a good while, hasn't it?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Well since from the old one, but then they came over a year, so I really don't know.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I don't come up to Mencap very often.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I think it's about 10 years.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Because we move them down there and then we move them up here, so I don't know.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
That's right, and most of it tends to be out where you live and in the evenings, isn't it?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Yeah, that's when you want to come in the evenings.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Yeah, because you live in Cardicat, we tend to come out to you, don't we, when we do the events out there.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Yeah.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And actually Jess, you're the first one that we've interviewed who lives on their own, lives independently.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I used to live with my mum and dad a long time ago, but they're not around, so.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Yeah, so you live in your own flat, is that right?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And if you don't mind me saying, Kev and Jess actually met at Chepstow Mencap, is that right?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Yeah, five years ago.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Five years ago?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So how long have you been together?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
That I don't know, we met at Chepstow School.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Five years, you've been in a relationship together?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Yeah, Thursday night.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Thursday night, yeah.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
That's when John Butter was live.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Yeah.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Yeah, so you met on the Thursday night social group?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Yeah.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Okay, so do you remember the actual night or is it?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I don't know, I think he's got the detail, I don't know.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
You do?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
18th of January.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Wow, so that must have stuck out.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So do you know what you were doing at the time?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
No.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
18th of January?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
That's last year, wasn't it?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
That was when the sports group joined the cooking group when we started to do events together, wasn't it?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Yeah, that was the cooking group on Thursday night with Annie.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So you were in a cooking group originally and Kev you were...

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
You were doing sports with the boys, weren't you?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
With Gary.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
With Gary and the boys doing the sports evening.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Oh nice, and you've been together ever since?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Yeah, since.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I'm not sure if this is going to be edited out but was it love at first sight for the both of you?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Hmm, I don't know, I don't know really, just in between.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
He grew on you, did he?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Yes, and she grew on you, was it Kev?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Well it was a bit difficult, yeah, but there you go.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000
You just have to get on with it because he can't text like he normally does because he keeps playing with his phone too much and wants a new phone.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So he rings and says, I love you, that's all he can do.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Well, we do talk and he says, I love you, I love you too, okay.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:55.000
But, you know, yeah, but sometimes he does it on his phone and says, I love you, and he says, I love you too Kev, and they can keep playing with their phones too much, don't you?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Well that's nice to be told you love, don't they?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
That's so nice.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So what things do you do at Chepstermencap then Kev? Can you tell me a little bit about your time with Chepstermencap?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Just go to the club, to the club.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Chepstermencap?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Chepstermencap? Is that where you first started?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Yeah, in 82.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
In 82?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Yeah.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Okay, tell me a little bit about how that started then.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I don't know.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Am I right in saying you used to be the DJ at the Chepstermencap?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Yeah, DJ, yeah.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
You were the DJ at the Chepstermencap?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
We'd go on the mountain, yeah.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Yeah, you and the boys behind the decks?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Yeah.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So what kind of music do you used to play?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I used to play the band.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
A bit of everything, was it?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So what did you do? Was Saturday club at the Ledger Centre?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Yeah.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Yeah. I remember coming to that as a kid and we used to go for a swimming session, didn't we?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Yeah.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And then play sports afterwards and go for a drink in the bar.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Did you learn to swim at Mencap?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Probably, yeah.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Probably.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
That's a long time ago, isn't it, 82?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Yeah.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So what about you, Jess? Do you remember when you first came to Mencap?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I really haven't got a clue, to be honest, Mike. I don't know.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Would it have been at the social evenings with Annie?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Well, we'd do a lot of different things. We'd do cook, we'd eat and then we'd come to join with you with the best of the gang, try to drink that tune.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So I really don't know how long that go is. I really don't know.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
That's fine if you don't know the dates or anything.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I don't know dates.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I don't know either myself, to be honest.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Are they all marriages, doesn't it?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Yeah.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Well, I've definitely known you since I started working here, so that's a good over 10 years that I've been working with you.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And yeah, so when I've seen you two together, it's mainly been in the evening groups, isn't it?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
So what evening groups do you remember? Can you remember any activities you've done?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Well, I used to do a cookery, we used to do sports with you a lot and then we'd done cookery with the girls quite a few times with the girls.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
And then we went to review, so it was a long time ago.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
That's a year before, I don't know.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
We used to go to the pub for a pint.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Yeah, yeah, sometimes.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
The Hay Wain and Caldecott, yeah.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
We used to go to Chepster one as well, sometimes.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Yeah, the Bent Barn.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Yeah.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Thank you, mum.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
That's all stopped now because of the germs and the Covid.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
It did stop during Covid, didn't it?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Yeah.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Sorry, Kev, what did you say?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Dairy Centre.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
The Lentre Centre?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
No, the other one.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Remember?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
In YB?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Yeah.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Yeah, the sports hall.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
No, the other one.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
It's in the road.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
The other one down the road.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Dairy Centre.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Oh, the Diving Centre.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Yeah.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
We used to go up there.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Go there in the summer because it's nice to sit off the deck in there, isn't it?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Yeah, I remember that.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000
But actually...

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
In the coming times.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Mm-hm.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
You were just saying about it doesn't happen so much now because of the germs and everything

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
because Covid hit, didn't it?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Mm-hm.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000
So were you two in contact during Covid or was it really difficult?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Probably difficult, I think.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
I'm not really sure, to be honest.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Do you, Kev?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I don't know.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
No.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
What makes it worth us then?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
How did you find Covid?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Because you live on your own, Jess.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Did you find...

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
You coped well with it or did you struggle?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I coped well with it because I'd been jabbed up so I didn't catch anything from it.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
So you just got to be careful in what you do.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Did you find...

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Did you experience any loneliness as you weren't seeing anyone as often?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
I was a little bit lonely but now it's not...

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Because I don't normally see people.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Only if I go for a walk and I say hello to people and that's about it.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And there's not many people around so it's quite good very often.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Did you manage with your supermarket because I know you like going to Aspen, don't you?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Yeah.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Sometimes the supermarket wouldn't let us in or only one at a time, wasn't it?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Yeah, because last time I couldn't go out because Dee had done my shopping for me because of the gym, was going around.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
So one of our support workers did that for you?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Because I couldn't go down because the gym was going around so I couldn't do it.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So there was not so much now.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Dee takes me shopping now so...

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
So you can go with Dee?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Yeah.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And is it mostly Dee that...

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:51.000
If Dee's got a day off or something and I'm one of the people like Carol or something like that.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Nice.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
So I know I don't like change but I always go along with it so I don't mind.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
I know you don't like change.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000
No, I don't.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.000
That's great but that's because I presume if Dee's having a day off she lets you know in advance.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Yeah, so she's very good at that.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And so if you've got advance notice, that's fine.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Yeah.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Oh, that's good.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
So you're saying you don't like change as such but so Covid was a massive change really, wasn't it?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Yeah.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Life changed pretty much overnight.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
But you think you coped with it pretty well and came out the other side?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Yeah.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Yeah?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Yeah.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
We visited you quite often, didn't we, through Covid?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Yeah.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
When the booster bus was coming?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Yeah, yeah, we came on more different days.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
You used to look out your window, didn't you?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Yeah, yeah, you used to look out my window and say, what's that down there?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
What's that coming out the road?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Oh god, these gangs.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
It's this lot coming out.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Did you enjoy having the visit from the booster bus?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Yeah, the Scooby bus.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Yeah.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Yeah, it was quite good.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
What about you, Ken?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Yeah, Ken, yeah.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
You remember the booster bus going to Crayf?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Yeah.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
I remember you used to be waiting in your garden as we were coming down the street.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Almost bang on time.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Tempting.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Yeah.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
They don't do that anymore, so.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
How did you find Covid then?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
What did you think?

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
How did you feel during that time?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Very good.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Not very good?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000
No.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000
No?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Did you miss seeing people?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Yeah?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
So you're glad things have got back to normal a bit now, right?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Yeah.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Yeah.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And we've started back up our social nights now.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So we've been doing different stuff from, you know, cinema nights to pub nights.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And we come into the hayway a bit more often.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
So if you'd like to pop over for a drink with us, that would be nice.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Anytime you fancy it, we'll let you know when we're next there.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Michael can get a message to you.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And if you wanted to come over, you could have a meal or a drink.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Yeah, I always give Dee the letters so she'll let you know.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Yeah.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
And then we fancy it.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Okay.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
So what else about Chepstom Encub?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Tell us what you think about Chepstom Encub.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
It's all right.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000
It's very good.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Very interesting.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
What do you like about it?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Well, you've got friends, have a laugh and a joke, you know, that kind of stuff.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
The social side of it, yeah.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Yeah.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
What about you, Kev?

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
What does a week at Chepstom Encub look like for you?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
What do you get up to during the week?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Not a lot.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Not a lot?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
No.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
You liar.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
I know you work very hard.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Yeah, I work Tuesday and Friday.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Tuesday and Friday.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
So can you tell me about what you do on those days?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
I do a bore center.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Yeah?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And what do you do at bore?

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
I go into the dust.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
So you garden at the bore community center.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Yeah.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Where else do you do the gardening?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
At the church.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
At the church.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And what about the road?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
St. Mary's Church over the road, yeah.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
You cut back all the brambles, didn't you?

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Yeah, this morning.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
You've been there this morning?

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Yeah.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
What did you do there?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Cut the grass.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Cut the grass.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Yeah.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And a couple of weeks ago you painted the function hall, didn't you?

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Yeah.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Painted the whole building.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
So you do quite a lot for the community then.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
It's been a long time now.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Doing it a long time, yeah.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
You're very popular in church.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
You have all the jobs you do.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
How does that make you feel doing a day's work?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I'm good.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Yeah?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Proud of the work once you've done it?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Yeah.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
You do a lovely job.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
You make the community center look beautiful when it's finished.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Who do you do that with?

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Richard.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Richard?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Yeah.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
He's the head gardener, isn't he?

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Is he a good laugh?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Hmm?

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Is he a good laugh?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Yeah.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
I always see you messing about for the most part and doing work in between.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
So what else do you guys do?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Anything else?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Kev does a lot of gardening, don't you?

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
That seems to be your main interest.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And Jess, you tend to have people come out and do one-to-one work with you, don't you?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Yeah.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
So what type of things do you do when they visit you in Caldeca?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Well, I see Dionne Friday.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
I work to Penn.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
I go to Penn.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Her husband goes down to the doctors and goes to the bandages.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
She always gave me a ring on Thursday to see what time and say, okay, that's fine.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And she gives me two.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I do my own routine.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
I go for work on a Monday.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
I go for work on a Wednesday.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
I go work with Dionne on Friday.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
The other two days I don't.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
I stay home.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.000
I think Dee was showing me some photos the other day.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
You down at the Equestrian site with the horses.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Yeah.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
David Brooms, you like to go and watch the horses?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Yeah, yeah, I like watching the horses.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Kevin came us at one time, didn't you?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Yes, yeah.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Yeah.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
You went together?

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Yeah, we went with him with Dee.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
So does Dee try and help you both get together?

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Yeah.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Yeah.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Yeah, it's great.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Where do you tend to meet?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
You just have to find the alleyways and find somewhere where I can get to.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Just over the side shops though.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Just over there.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
You go Caldecott Castle?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Yeah.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
What, you meet Jess there, do you?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
That's a nice place to meet.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
We did.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Yeah, that was a long time ago that was.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000
But now I came up here now.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Then coming to go then, yeah.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
So Rich gives you a lift there.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
On the bus.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
On the bus, you go on the bus with Rich.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Yeah.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And Dee, you go with him.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Yeah.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And then you go on the bus with Rich.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Yeah.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And Dee takes you to the castle.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Yeah.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
And you get to meet up.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Yeah.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
That's nice.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
How often do you do that?

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
It depends.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
It depends, as often as you can.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Lovely.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Okay.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Oh, that's good.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Yeah, that's nice.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
And haven't I seen a photo somewhere?

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Who buys the other one chocolate?

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Normally, yeah, normally.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
But it depends, really.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
You buy her chocolate, do you?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Yeah.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
I don't know.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
What's the price of chocolate?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
I don't know.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000
It depends, yeah.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
How much is it?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
It depends.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Yeah.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
But it depends, really.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
You buy her chocolate, do you?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Yeah.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Either for either Christmas or my birthday, whichever.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Nice.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Yeah.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Yeah.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
You just stand by the door and ask about it.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
It doesn't come from my house, because my auntie wouldn't like that.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Only from my door and ask it.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Yeah.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Oh, that's fair.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
That's fair enough.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
It's what I literally get the opportunity to meet up, isn't it?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Mm-hmm.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
You can do it on your own terms.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Yeah.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Lovely.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
So five years together.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Mm-hmm.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Wow, that's a good amount of time, isn't it?

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Yeah.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And you can do it on your own terms.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Yeah.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Lovely.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
So five years together.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Mm-hmm.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Wow, that's a good amount of time, isn't it?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Yeah.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000
You blush in, Cap.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Huh?

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
You blush in.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Yeah, we do.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Oh, that's lovely.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
And it's really nice to have watched your relationship grow over the years.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Mm-hmm.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And it's nice that Chepstam and Cap and your parents and carers have been able to help

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
you meet up, especially as you live in different towns, you know.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Sometimes it can be difficult.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
And so do you have a lot of time to spend with your family?

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Yeah.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
I do.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000
I do.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
I do.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000
I do.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
I do.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
I do.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
I do.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
I do.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I do.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000
I do.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
I do.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000
I do.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
I do.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
I do.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
I do.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And so do you have a lot of input from your aunt?

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Yeah.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Yes.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she does.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
She takes me on a few holidays and, like, going to Canada.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
But we stay in the hotel Monday night.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
We don't fly till Tuesday.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
You're going to Canada?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Yeah.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Flying from Heathrow.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Where?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Oh, wow.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
On Tuesday.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Wow.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
I'm so glad that...

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
It's a long flight, like I said.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Where in Canada are you going?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Um, Brat...

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
I'm sorry.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
I'm sorry.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
I'm sorry.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
I'm sorry.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
I'm sorry.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
I'm sorry.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000
I'm sorry.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
I'm sorry.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000
I'm sorry.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I'm sorry.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Can I talk to you for a minute?

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Hello.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000
On what day are you flying in?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Um, um, Brantford.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Brantford.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Oh, I see.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Yeah, it's like in Toronto.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
I call it Toronto, but it's Brantford, Toronto.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Yeah.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Yeah.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000
So, staying in the house for two weeks.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Lovely.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
It could be hot over there.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.160
That's the thing about we is.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.160
Have you been there before?

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.160
To Canada?

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.160
Yeah, yeah, quite a few times.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.920
What made you choose Canada then?

00:16:51.920 --> 00:17:01.660
Well, I think it was my mother's idea before she went, so it was her idea, really.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:02.660
Yeah.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.380
How many times have you been?

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.140
Oh my gosh.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.140
Long time ago, been on this thing.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.140
Because it was cold at that time.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:15.580
Because it was my Auntie Cass surprise birthday party

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:17.980
when somebody else's friend saw me.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:21.860
Me and my mum and dad came and went down to somebody's house,

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:23.740
friends basement just downstairs.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.580
And had to go and say hello, so and so.

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:28.580
And we all came up and said, surprise!

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.540
Because it was cold that time over there.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.140
Yeah, it was quite good.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.220
But now Jenny told me, I'm going to take you to Canada.

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.420
Oh, that'd be nice.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.100
I can't wait.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.100
So there we are.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:46.740
We've been to Canada and I've got a feeling where you're saying

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:51.060
Bramford, I think that might be where Cara went with himself.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.180
Your dad's cousin.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.260
Yeah, but I call it Toronto.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.220
But I call it Toronto.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.540
But people call it, it's not Toronto, it's Bramford.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.700
Toronto's on the other side.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.220
I still call it Toronto.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:03.140
So part of Canada, really.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:04.060
That's what you know.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.300
Yeah.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.260
Do you buy anything when you're in Canada?

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.460
Sometimes clothes, sometimes I buy sweets.

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.140
Sometimes, depends really.

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:17.380
Because I go to Niagara on the lake.

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:18.260
Niagara?

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.020
Mm.

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:19.700
Wow.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.300
I've been to Niagara Falls because when you go to Niagara Falls,

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.900
you've got this boat that takes you up by the waterfall.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:29.020
Because you go with this mat thing to keep your clothes dry

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.540
or something, you just go near the, oh gosh, it's getting cold.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:33.180
I'm getting wet.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:34.060
No, you're not wet.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.380
Just where the water splashes you.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:37.660
It's quite fun.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.820
Do you know people used to go over that in barrels?

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:41.580
Mm.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.020
Some adrenaline junkies used to get in a little wooden barrel

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.300
and they'd float off the edge of it.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.700
And I have no idea why.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:49.780
That's stupid.

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:50.420
It is.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.300
Especially when you've seen it in person.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.980
You wouldn't want to go over there in a boat, let alone fall.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.900
Well, it was a little boat it was.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:58.980
It was quite fun.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.100
I'm trying to think of what they call that though.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.140
Is it Sea of the Mist or something?

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.220
Something like that.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.660
Lady of the Mist or something like that.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:06.460
Yeah.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.900
And it's a poncho.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.380
You're all given a certain colour poncho, aren't you?

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.100
Yeah.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.180
To protect you.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:15.860
Yeah, it's like a big mac poncho.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.940
Yeah, I think it's either mac or poncho.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:18.860
I'm not really sure.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.900
It's to keep your clothes not too, if you get a little bit wet,

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.260
it doesn't matter anyway.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:23.860
No.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.660
That's worth it for the experience, isn't it?

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.860
It is, yeah.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.500
And Kevin, you've just come back from holiday, haven't you?

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.820
Yeah, Landednow.

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:32.540
Landednow?

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:33.020
Yeah.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:33.980
Lovely.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:37.300
What did you do up there?

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.940
You know, walk.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:39.980
Yeah?

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.220
Where did you go walking?

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.220
Conway.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:46.940
Conway?

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:47.340
Yeah.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.380
Yeah?

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.140
So did you see all the mountain ranges up there?

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.060
Yeah, yeah.

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.460
It's beautiful in North Wales, isn't it?

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.700
Loads and loads of take-hills.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:56.620
Loads of?

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.420
Seagulls.

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.860
Seagulls, is it?

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.500
Trying to steal your food.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.580
They're renowned up there for stealing your chips, aren't they?

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:04.780
You've got to be careful.

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.100
And Weston.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.300
And Weston.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.420
Weston.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:08.900
Weston.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.380
I'm going to talk about Landednow, though.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.020
Did you go out on the pier on the?

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.300
Yeah, a couple of times.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.020
A couple of times.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.820
I thought you would like it.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.140
And the reason why I thought you would like it is just

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.980
what you're about to say.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.780
Where did you used to go on holiday every February?

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:27.900
Weston.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.060
Weston, the supermaid.

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:30.940
I miss it now.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:31.820
I miss it now.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.860
We all miss it.

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.780
Yeah, we all used to go together, didn't we?

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:36.700
Mm.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.740
When was the last time you went?

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:39.860
Last time we went was?

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.940
2000.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:42.620
That's all we did.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:43.340
No, about...

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:44.820
That's all we did.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:45.460
No.

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.820
About five years ago, I think, we stopped.

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.180
No.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:54.620
I can remember, we went to Weston, the supermaid.

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.900
There was a carnival.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.180
That's right.

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.380
I think coming from...

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:03.380
You went on the coach for that.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.460
That was...

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.100
It was at night time, it was.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.340
With Alan Bishop.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.300
With Alan Bishop and Margaret and then other friends,

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.460
because we were in different groups.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:16.460
I went with Margaret and then we have...

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.340
And, what's his name, Alan?

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.500
And then with me, Kimberly and Jimmy,

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:21.980
and one came with us.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.140
And we went in other groups

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:25.980
and we all went to...

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.620
Because there was normally drums and stuff comes first,

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:32.660
and then you've got the big carnival comes along as well.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.900
That's all I can remember, but it is quite good.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:35.820
All the floats.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.940
Yeah, yeah, very good down there, actually.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.980
I didn't realise you went to that.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.460
Yeah, it was organised, it was.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.340
That's why we all went down there.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.180
Yeah.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.180
And we came back late, so...

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.060
Yeah, Chester and Minkup used to organise a trip

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.340
to Weston, the supermaid,

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:55.740
but the actual carnival was Bridgewater Carnival.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.300
I've been there, Kimberly, 10.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.580
Yes, you've been to actually Bridgewater

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:00.980
and Glastonbury as well.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:01.820
Yeah.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:06.820
And it used to tour a few towns, about 10 towns.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:07.900
Yeah.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.220
And you used to choose to go to the one in Weston.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.420
Yeah, it was quite good.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:13.260
And why was that?

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.060
They stopped doing that now, so.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.260
But why was it at night?

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:21.180
Because it was quite easy with some people.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.900
People normally do work during the days

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.620
and some people like doing it at night times

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.100
because it's easier at night time.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.060
So I think that's why we decided to do it at night time

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:30.540
because it's easier.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.860
And it's because they all lit up, didn't they?

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.340
Yeah.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.580
Thousands of light bulbs.

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.620
Yeah, yeah, that's why it's easy to do at night time.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:39.460
Yeah.

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.300
It was quite spectacular, actually.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.740
Mm, it was, very good.

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:46.020
Did you like it, Kimberly?

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.900
I mean, went to Weston, Baywater.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.700
And Bridgewater, yes.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.100
We used to park on a carriage four quarter.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.380
Yeah, car park.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:56.220
The garage.

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:57.060
That's right.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:57.900
I know.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.060
With Willett's.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.620
Willett's coaches.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.460
Wow.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:06.420
And Clive, the driver, yes.

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.900
You've got a good memory, Kev.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.820
A really good memory.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.900
What a nice thing to have done then and remember.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:19.740
Also, I was just talking to someone

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.180
earlier, did you used to go to sports

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.300
in the Special Olympics, Jess?

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.900
God, I don't know.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:34.100
Doing sports on, practice in Swansea or?

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.220
I went to Swindon.

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:38.780
To London?

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:42.260
Swindon, the castle was somewhere.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.740
Swindon.

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:44.580
Swindon?

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:45.420
Yeah.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.580
Swindon, was that with the Special Olympics?

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.420
Yeah.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:49.260
It was.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.940
You've been a, oh wow, can you tell us a bit

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:53.260
about the Special Olympics?

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:57.100
What sports did you do?

00:23:58.260 --> 00:23:59.260
Running.

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:00.100
Running.

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:07.820
Born.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:08.660
Bumbling.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:09.500
Yeah.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.340
Was it boccia or?

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.540
Yeah, anything, yeah.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:14.420
Yeah, boccia, I think they call it now.

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.180
We went to meet the Special Olympics team,

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.740
the Welsh athletes.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:23.220
From the Great British team on Monday

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:25.580
at the Senate in Cardiff, a few of us went along

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:29.900
to like a good luck ceremony before they go to Berlin.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:30.740
That was nice.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.380
So did you enjoy the Special Olympics?

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.780
Was that a good experience?

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.220
Yeah, I swindled in.

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.180
In Swindon?

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.020
Yeah.

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:41.020
So you traveled up there and you competed in the games.

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:42.340
Did you win?

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.500
Yeah, a couple of times.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.860
Yeah, did you get any, what do you get, a medal?

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:46.700
Yeah, yeah.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.620
Yeah, nice.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.060
You look back on that with fond memories.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.540
Who organized that then?

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:56.300
I don't know.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.140
Not sure?

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:00.860
I think, if I'm right, Sarah Griswold was quite instrumental

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.780
in doing a lot of the Special Olympics trips.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:04.620
Is that right?

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.060
I think there was a chap called Tony.

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:08.380
Tony, yeah.

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:11.060
Yeah, I think he used to do it with you.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:14.700
And so Sarah was saying, Jess,

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:17.260
that she thinks she went to Swansea.

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.100
Can you remember doing any sports?

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.220
Did you run or relay anything?

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:24.900
Oh, well, I don't know,

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.140
because Sarah said I don't run

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:29.100
when I jumped on the sand on my bum.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.540
You did the long jump then.

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.620
Well, I don't know, I can't remember.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:33.460
That's what Sarah did.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.060
Remember you used to do the long jump,

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.860
you went on your bum, I can't remember that.

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:38.700
It's quite a long time ago.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.660
Yeah, it was a long time ago, I believe.

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:42.940
So have you ever?

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:43.940
That's right, I used to have run down,

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:46.980
having Swansea, jacking and out of bottoms.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:49.580
So are you talking about the tracksuit?

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:52.820
Yes, the tracksuit, yeah, I still got it.

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:53.660
Oh, Jess.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.220
I'm warning you, but I still got it.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:01.380
I have been looking for someone

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.620
to see if they've still got their tracksuit.

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:07.060
I still kept mine, I still don't know if I still kept it.

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.820
Would you mind us maybe borrowing it for the exhibition?

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.340
Just for a month.

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:15.020
It depends what size it is.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.220
No one will wear it.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:20.580
It'll just be to show what the outfit looked like, really.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:21.620
Only if you're comfortable with it,

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:22.700
you can have a think about it.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.180
Yeah, I'll think about it.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.180
You don't have to answer now.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.020
I'll think about it.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.900
Was it a red tracksuit or was it a black and yellow?

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:32.140
No, it was yellow, it was black and yellow.

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:35.020
Yellow, yeah, that's the one I'm familiar with

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:37.660
and then they had a red tracksuit in the later years,

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:38.500
I think, wasn't it?

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.460
Yeah, I still got my tracksuit, it was black and yellow.

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:42.620
Well, we would love to see it

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:44.940
if you'd be willing to let us see it.

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.540
I'll think about it.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.180
It's a piece of history, isn't it?

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.340
That's kind of what this is all about.

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:54.980
I think we used to share bedrooms, something like that.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.740
I remember, must be a long time ago.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.540
I know there's a bedroom there,

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.380
it must be a long time ago, but I can't remember.

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:02.740
It would have been a long time ago,

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:06.860
but actually, before you leave today,

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.220
I do have photos of everyone

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:14.060
in their yellow and black tracksuits.

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.100
So we'll have a look and we'll see if you're on the photos.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.260
Yeah, because Adrian wears his ponzi jacket now and again.

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:21.940
Yeah, yeah.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.180
Adrian, he?

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:26.660
Yeah, yeah, he wears his jacket now and again.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:27.980
Well, if you've got the tracksuit,

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.060
you must have been part of the team.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.460
Yeah, that's where we went out to ponzi.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:36.260
Yeah, so you did yours in ponzi?

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.420
Yeah, yeah, must have been, yeah,

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:39.940
because Sarah was there as well.

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:41.660
I think they did it in Birmingham as well,

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.340
I know there's a few over the years.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.660
I'll have to look back through the photos.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.260
My sister Wendy did it in the Isle of Wight.

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:49.260
Oh gosh.

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:50.700
And Edinburgh.

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.060
Oh gosh.

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:56.220
Long way away, but I'm thrilled to bits

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:59.340
to think you've still got the tracksuit, Jess.

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:00.180
That's great.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:05.100
So we'll have a chat with you about that later.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.420
Have you got any other memories

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.220
that you'd like to share about Chatsumetha?

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.940
Could be anything, good or bad, funny, sad?

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:15.180
No.

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:18.100
No, anything you can think of over the years

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.140
that you'd like to mention,

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.140
that you think would be important

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.980
for people to hear that you've done?

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.380
No, I don't know.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.940
No, that's fair enough, that's okay.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.020
What about you Jess?

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:32.140
What's that?

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:34.340
Have you got any memories of Chatsumetha

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.380
that you'd like to share?

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.940
Not particularly, just all good fun

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:40.580
and fun to laugh and joke with friends,

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:41.980
not particularly much.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.500
Yeah, so just a good time all right.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:45.340
Yeah.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:48.220
Nice, well I'll ask you some questions then.

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.620
What do you think of the new building we've got?

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.100
Yeah, it's quite nice.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.100
This used to be a wood barn, didn't it?

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:54.940
But then Kevin said,

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:57.500
now you've got wood down there now.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:01.940
Yeah, this used to be a school originally, yeah.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.580
And then it was kind of a-

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:05.420
It's like a wood thing,

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.420
you see a wood by there, wood over by there,

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.580
and then they changed it around.

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.100
It's a glass factory after all,

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.300
not a factory but a glass merchant's.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.660
You've seen any change for wood something over there,

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.460
you said didn't you Kev?

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:22.020
Kev, you said you'd been moving stuff around

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.740
the woods from over there, you said didn't you,

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.300
with the wood stuff.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:26.140
Oh the workshop.

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.780
Yeah, it used to be here but it's moved over there.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:31.140
That's next door, that's where we do all the-

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.580
Oh, that's probably the-

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.740
The workshops at the-

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:36.540
Oh, that's where you swapped it around.

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:38.260
Ah, right.

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:39.460
I didn't know that.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.660
But compared to the Barclay,

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.740
because the Barclay was a lot smaller than this place,

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:43.580
wasn't it?

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:45.260
Yeah, it was, yeah.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.380
Do you miss the Barclay?

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:47.700
Yes, yes.

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.300
Yeah, you've got fun memories there?

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:53.700
Yeah, good things, good dinner.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:54.540
Used to do a lot of-

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:55.380
Good dinner.

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:56.220
Yeah.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:57.060
Yeah, they used to do that.

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.180
Yeah, you used to do a lot of little parties

00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:59.020
in there, didn't they?

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.060
Yeah, we did.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:02.300
Yeah, little fun disco things and whatever.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.300
Good, the best,

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:06.340
thanks for being through the night.

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.020
You're welcome.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:09.420
So there you go there, yeah?

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:10.260
Yeah.

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:13.620
So what do you think of the new space we got here?

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:14.900
Very big.

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:15.740
It's huge, isn't it?

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:16.860
Plenty of room.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:17.700
Yeah?

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.220
Yeah, there was a lot of stuff in there.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.780
We've had a few parties here since it's been open.

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.340
Had some good fun.

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.620
So on a Thursday night at the Barclay,

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:31.740
I believe you made pizzas, Jess,

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.700
in the cookery group,

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.300
and then the boys would come in later and eat the pizzas.

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.140
Yeah.

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:42.460
And that's how you started to combine your evening, actually.

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.060
It went from full-on cooking

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.860
to more of a social at the pub.

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.500
Yeah, it would be hungry after a game of football, wouldn't it?

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:54.620
Yeah.

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.540
Well, it was originally a ladies group, wasn't it?

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:59.660
Yeah, it was a girls group, you know, we do it.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:03.260
Yeah, I think that was when I started doing all that,

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.300
I think doing a girls cookery thing.

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.780
It was.

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:07.700
Yeah.

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.700
And you all used to learn how to cook

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:13.580
and you'd make a dish on the night, which you could take home, couldn't you?

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.380
Yeah.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:17.300
Yeah, we can't do that anymore.

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:18.820
No, no.

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.380
So what about the events that we've done over the years,

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.380
like the fashion shows and things like that?

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:26.220
Yeah, yeah.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:28.140
Have you guys taken part in them?

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.100
No, I don't do fashion shows.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:31.940
It's not my thing.

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:33.980
I could see, yes, when you come to the fashion show,

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:37.300
I don't do anything, so no, no, that's fair enough.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.780
No, and if it's not your bag, it's not your bag, you know?

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:43.500
No, I said no, it's not my thing, so I'm not going to go, so.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:44.500
Yeah.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:49.100
Which is great, and it's great that Dee supports you

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.820
and you do things with her.

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:52.420
Yeah.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:52.900
That suits you.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.500
Yeah, that's what I do, like my routine, so.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.820
You do like your routine.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:57.220
Yeah.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:58.020
That's important to you.

00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.340
Yeah, yeah.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:02.460
Is there anything you guys would like to ask us?

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:03.940
What do you do, Mike?

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.180
What do I do here?

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:05.660
Yeah.

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:07.460
I'm a support worker.

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:08.580
Yeah, I know, what do you do?

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:09.820
I'm a jester.

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:10.580
You live with Molly?

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:11.820
I'm a gardener.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:12.500
You live with Molly?

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:13.700
I'm an actor.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.300
I'm a cinema projectionist.

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.340
You don't look like an actor to me.

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:18.580
I'm a chef.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:21.780
No, you're not, well, that's at home.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:25.820
I'm a carer, but most of all, I'm a mate, I think.

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:29.340
We're just here to have fun, as far as I'm concerned.

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.260
Well, when are you getting married to Molly?

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.420
When am I getting married to Molly?

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:33.700
Now that's a question.

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:34.220
When?

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:36.580
Because every time I come up, you keep wearing that ring.

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:37.580
It's not a wedding ring.

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.220
No, it's not a wedding ring.

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.180
It's just a ring.

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:41.420
It's not on the right finger, that one.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.220
No, it's on the left hand.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:45.020
Do you want to know some exciting news?

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:45.580
Well.

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:47.860
Me and Molly have booked a wedding venue.

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:48.900
Where's that?

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:52.620
In, oh, let me remember the name of it.

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.340
Oh, Molly would kill me if she is.

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:55.700
Oh, gosh.

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:59.780
I can tell you it's called Clock Barn, and it's in, help me out, mum.

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:00.580
Where's that too?

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:01.220
In Hampshire.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:02.220
Or Winster or somewhere.

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:03.860
Hampshire, it ends in a shire.

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:05.380
Oh, so it's a shire, Hampshire.

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.260
It could be the shire in New Zealand for all I know.

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.140
Oh, so we're up there.

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.740
Yeah, so in 2025, me and Molly will be.

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:12.740
Two years time.

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.140
Two years time, yeah.

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.740
That's where you get married, is it?

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:16.940
Yep, that's the plan.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.820
Mike, you know the date?

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:20.740
The date?

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:21.780
They don't know yet, do they?

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:24.980
I'm not sure of the date, if we've got a general time of year.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.500
They've got to go to the honeymoon, yes.

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.220
You've got to find what they'd get married first.

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:29.420
Oh, the honeymoon.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:34.660
After we pay for the wedding, I think the honeymoon would be, I don't know,

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.460
either this hotel over the road or something.

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:38.820
Yeah.

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:41.060
Don't people go abroad on their honeymoon, don't they?

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:41.740
They do.

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:46.260
Oh, they just do a honeymoon, go to the hotel, stay a bit longer or whatever.

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:47.300
That's right.

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.700
What about you two, any wedding bells ringing?

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:50.500
God, no way.

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:51.380
No, no.

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:54.540
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.620
One day, one day.

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:57.620
One day.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.020
So have you got any questions?

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.180
What about you, Sue?

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:03.500
What do you do?

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:04.300
What do I do?

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:04.700
Yeah.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.540
That's interesting.

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:12.740
So I'm actually chair of Chester Mencap, which means I do the paperwork.

00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:22.140
And I'm interested in doing what I do as a volunteer, because I just like knowing all of you.

00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:28.020
And, you know, I love the fact that we go out in the evenings, that we see you in the day.

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:31.620
I just like being involved with Chester Mencap.

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:34.620
But apart from that, I'm retired.

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.180
So I like holidays.

00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:41.260
I've been on the holidays since Covid.

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:42.620
Chocolate enthusiast.

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:45.980
Yeah, totally.

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:47.100
I do pottery.

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:47.900
Oh, nice.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:49.540
But I'm really no good at it.

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:50.980
I discovered that last night.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:52.700
Oh dear.

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:55.060
Does that mean you have to teach her to do it again?

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.220
Her work is beautiful.

00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:57.620
She's been humble.

00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:58.580
Humble.

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:00.140
Oh, I love you.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.980
I just don't do pots.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:05.380
You do any gardening at all?

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:07.220
Funnily enough.

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.420
It's been a nice day.

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:10.820
My garden is looking beautiful.

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:12.380
Do you water any plants at all?

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.220
Because we do have this weather.

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.740
Mark does watering.

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:16.740
Right.

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:21.300
We've planted everything up and it's all in pots, so it's easy.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.980
He mows the lawn.

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:24.140
I like sitting on it.

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:26.460
I've got the most lovely patio.

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.860
You're just lying in the sun.

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.140
Yeah, a couple of times.

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.660
Yeah, I think you've had squash or an ice cream on my patio.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.220
Yeah, a couple of times.

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:35.700
Yeah.

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.260
Yeah, so.

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.100
How many live here for?

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:40.860
How many?

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:42.900
How many live here for?

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:43.660
How many have I lived here?

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:44.340
Yeah.

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:45.140
Yeah.

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:48.660
Well, funnily enough, we moved there.

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:50.380
How old are you, Mike?

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:51.820
32 now.

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:53.620
So I moved into that house.

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.180
I'm 43.

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:56.100
Yeah.

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:56.820
Really?

00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:00.860
I thought me and you were similar age.

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:05.740
So we moved into the house and I got pregnant that night.

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:07.060
With Mike, was there?

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.020
Nine months later, we had Michael.

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.260
Oh, my God.

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.500
Now he's grown up like a weed now.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:13.020
Yeah.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:14.700
He's grown up like a weed.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:18.060
Yeah, when you're a baby, you're like this.

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:21.660
So I always know how long I've lived in my house.

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:24.460
By asking Mike how old he is.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:24.980
32.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:25.460
Yeah.

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.740
Yeah.

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:31.540
So I'm basically a walking time stamp.

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.020
Yeah.

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:34.220
So any other questions?

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:34.740
No.

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:36.060
It's quite nice to be asked the question.

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:36.860
No.

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:38.100
You should be.

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.660
How tall are you?

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:47.820
1.2, because both 2.4.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:48.660
When did I join?

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:49.540
Yeah.

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:53.260
Well, I've been involved for Checks the Men cap all my life.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.020
I've known you guys.

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:55.140
How many years?

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:56.060
Well, 32 years.

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:57.020
I've known most of you.

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:58.060
Yeah.

00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:01.740
But then I came back from university.

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:03.020
You knew me when I was that tall.

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:03.580
Yeah.

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:04.300
Yeah.

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:06.100
You'd have known him from a baby, actually.

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:07.100
Yeah.

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:10.620
Yeah, I got photos of some of you guys holding me as a babe.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:11.900
Oh my God.

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:13.380
I wasn't.

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:15.220
Still as happy as I was.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:16.340
So was anybody else was?

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:17.700
We're not looking us now.

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.700
Yeah, exactly.

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:24.020
I tell you what, Michael's going to take your photo, actually,

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:25.580
with your permission.

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:26.700
Yeah.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:27.780
I like photographing.

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:31.420
We're photographing, and what we're doing is we're sending the photos off

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:34.300
to people who are running this project.

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:39.460
We're building up, well, just our story about how we're doing this project.

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:40.420
So that's OK.

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:41.180
Yeah.

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:47.580
And it's photos that we took, like of Michael as a baby, with you guys

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:52.340
and you, Jess, in your black and yellow tracksuit.

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:55.540
And that's what gives us the memories and helps us remember.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:57.020
Isn't it?

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:57.780
Yeah.

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:00.860
Yeah, we're just trying to build up a picture from the beginning

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.420
all the way to this beautiful building we're sat in.

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:04.340
No.

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:04.860
Yeah.

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:07.700
And what's happened over the last 50 years.

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.460
Because how old are you, Kev?

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:10.740
58.

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:12.620
58.

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:17.620
Right, so you would have been eight years old when, no, six years old

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:19.860
when Mencap started.

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:23.380
And you know Leonie, don't you?

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.940
Because she lives in your street.

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:30.740
Because you used to go to another place rather than Chester Mencap

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:32.060
during the week.

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:33.980
You used to go to Orchard Trust.

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:35.060
Yeah.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.140
About 18 years.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:38.140
About 18 years.

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:39.500
About, about.

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:41.220
Yeah, well that would fit in.

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.460
18 years there.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.140
About 18 years.

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.500
And what did you use to do at Orchard Trust?

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:51.020
Dominoes.

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:52.260
Dominoes?

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:53.900
Dominoes.

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:54.540
Animals.

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:54.980
Yeah.

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:55.900
Oh, the animals.

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.740
The sheep.

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:00.020
There's a photo of you holding a lamb, isn't there?

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:01.020
Yeah.

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:03.740
I got a picture of him up home as well.

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:05.700
He's holding a baby lamb.

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:06.700
With his eyes closed.

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:09.700
I think he flashed something he doesn't know where he was.

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:13.180
He had his eyes closed like this.

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:16.100
Because I think somebody flashed it on the camera on his face

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:17.420
with his eyes closed like this.

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:19.100
If you can find that photo.

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.940
I got it at my bedroom.

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:23.660
Can we scan it again?

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:26.700
Because we're putting a story together.

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.100
Yes, I can remember that now.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.380
You doubt the animals.

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:31.500
And what about you, Jess?

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.180
What have you done over the decades?

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:35.820
Which school did you go to?

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:38.980
Oh, I used to go to lots of different schools when I was little.

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:39.780
Yeah?

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:43.820
Yeah, I used to go to St. Mary's.

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:44.900
And then I went to...

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:46.140
And I was going to be a bit more.

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:49.460
I went to Cottercock College.

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:52.260
Then I went to St. Joe's.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.380
Then after that, I went to Nash College.

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:56.940
And then, all gone.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.980
So those schools that you mentioned,

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.980
they're all Catholic schools, aren't they?

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:08.260
Only one Catholic school was St. Mary's and St. Joe's School.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:10.860
Yeah, those were Catholic schools.

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.460
Yeah, West End School wasn't though.

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:15.260
West End? Was that in...

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:17.940
That's down the bottom of the road.

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:18.820
Yeah.

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:22.140
Yeah, but it was all changed all around, you know, so yeah.

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:23.980
Yeah, yeah.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:26.140
And you went to Nash Tech, I used to call it.

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.500
Yeah, yeah, I took on...

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.060
Well, it's Nash College, it is.

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.540
But I used to go there Monday to Friday,

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:33.900
use the class to press there and back, so.

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.300
And what did you do there?

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.500
Um, we'd do computer work.

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.220
And then do some other classroom upstairs

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:43.060
and do what you want, really.

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:45.260
So yeah, just work there.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.860
Just paperwork or computer work or whatever you do.

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:51.620
And half round you go, do the same thing.

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.820
Then you go home.

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:55.740
Yeah, that's why I come there.

00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:57.660
Good.

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:02.340
But, well, can I take this opportunity, both of you,

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:04.420
just thank you so much,

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:07.020
because you both agreed to this,

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:09.020
and I'm thrilled about that.

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:10.180
No problemo.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:12.700
And I just hope that you both enjoyed it

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.340
and found it quite relaxing.

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.060
Yeah, what about you, Kelly?

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:21.420
Yeah, and thank you so much, you know, it means a lot, so.

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.460
I thought you were about to cry.

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:24.820
I look as if I'm about to cry.

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:25.740
Yeah.

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:27.580
Oh, gosh, there you are.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.500
It has been nice going over old memories and talking about it,

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:34.660
and it's such an important thing to capture.

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:36.940
Because, you know, it's the memories of you guys.

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:40.460
Right, good bowling a lot.

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:41.860
You do go bowling a lot with us, don't you?

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:45.180
Yeah, I mean, yes, yes, too.

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:47.180
Yeah, we used to, well, we'd play Skittles every week, didn't we?

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:48.780
Yeah, we'd have a big club.

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.340
Yeah.

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:51.580
Yes, OK, great.

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:54.020
I think we'll finish there then, guys, if you're all right with that.

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:54.420
Yeah.

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:55.340
Any other questions?

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:56.620
No, no, no.

00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:58.220
Happy days.

00:41:58.220 --> 00:41:59.380
You have to cut a softener.

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:00.580
V.

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:03.060
Happy days, eh?

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:04.300
Cut.

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.060
Leave your mics on.
