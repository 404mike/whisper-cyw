00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360
When I was, I told Karen this story, when I was 13, you know, I was an avid history

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.000
reader and when I went to university I studied history before I did political science.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.360
You know, I'm not a doctoral student even in it, but it was a great interest in.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.240
And so when I was 13 I realized how alone my dad maybe would have felt being in Britain

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.720
with Europe full of Nazis and Soviets and none of them very kind to Jewish people and

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.520
them actively bombing Cardiff and London and it didn't look too good, you know, and the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.160
Americans weren't in the war yet and you start to read things in a less, you know, anachronistic

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.280
way, you know, starting to be a teenager.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.520
And so I asked him, I said, you know, weren't you terrified, you know?

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.840
So he said, he said, what he said was odd, he said that the point was to make the women feel safe.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.520
So they didn't express that.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.640
That's what he said.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.040
That was his answer.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.360
He talked, I mean, the other thing was he kind of terrified me because I was interested in history.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.200
So he talked about, you know, bombings and I mean, you know, not in a purposely terrifying way,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.080
but I'd be reading and staying in the tube and things like that.
