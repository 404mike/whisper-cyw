WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Tell me again who they were. This is just for captions.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
That's a... yeah, well...

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Well, he's William Benjamin. He used to be a shepherd at Glen Hyarin.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Yeah.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
That's Pugh Gwadoli, Tommy Pugh, Thomas Pugh Gwadoli Farm.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Yes, yes.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
By the dead over there.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I would know them all, definitely, but I can't quite see it plain enough, really.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Erm...

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I don't know...

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Really, what it is, either.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
He looks like...

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Is that a... oh, it's faces they've got there.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Yeah, yeah, that's the... she had it with hands, eh?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And she had them on the bench, and there's the wall coming down here,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and then you get something to put up.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
These are what Chappell takes to side around.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Oh, very important.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Yeah, you know, once or twice in the morning, once or twice in the afternoon.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
See, there you go.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Very magnifying glass, you can bring those out, I might know.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Have we got a magnifying glass?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And that, but... oh, God, what I want to see.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
This is a man, that's John Davies, the hermit.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Ah, yeah, is that...

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
John Davies, that would be...

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Tudor's grandfather, would it?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
That's right.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
They were good men and true, weren't they?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Oh, that's it, well, that's from who?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Well, that's photo 12, is it?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Yes.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Yeah, John Davies, the hermit, that's right.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Yes, because I think S1 came from Mary Connolly, the Morgan.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Do you know, I thought it was... it's Nana Throod, I think, to share in it.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Yes, yes, it is, because...

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Oh, that's right, I used to go there as a kid myself.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
They used to live... they used to live in that house there, behind you.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And then they moved to Nana Throod, the Morgans.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Who did?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
That's... that's Goodolly House, yeah?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Yes, but that's where they moved from.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Well, I never...

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
They lived there and they moved to there.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Well, that must have been a very long time ago.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
19... she reckons 1940.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Because that... Tommy Pugh, him there, lived at that house.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Mm.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
When is it, 1914, is it?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
1914.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Hugh Goodolly, he was from... a son from Batalloch.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Which house is that?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
There's one brother here, there's one brother at Abergoogie, one brother at Batalloch.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
That's Goodolly House, that is.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Do you know who... who lived in Goodolly? Where Martin Pugh used to live.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Yes, yes, and my friend Rosanne lived in the Goodolly Hall.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Yes, she lived... yes, that's right.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Yes, yes, they lived there, round the corner.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
She lived in the cottage at the back.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
That's right, yes, yes.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Does it tell you, David, who they are?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Where now?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Does it tell you what the pictures are?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
No, that one relates to this picture.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Oh, that's an old one.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Oh, I see.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Right house.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
That's before me.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
This is from Jill Richardson, her great-grandfather.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Oh, you've got something up there, yeah.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Yes, that's all about Ellen Valley.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
He was Daniel Henry Edwards and he helped run the shop up at Ellen Valley.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Oh, I see.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And Hughes has run the shop, a little shop up there by the Devil's Gulch, they call it now or something.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
This was Morgan's as well.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Oh, that's Nana's house, yes.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
That's the Morgan's at Nanafield.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Yes.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Because that's Mary Connolly's dad.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Oh, Ruben, I see, yes.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And her granddad.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Well, good, you're a little sweet.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Oh, Jesus me.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
He's died, Mike, isn't he?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Good Lord.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Oh, dear, they should have come here at 9 o'clock this morning.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Oh, never mind.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
They'll have a little game.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Yes.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
God, gracious me.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I know him.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Well, it looks like Garonry Davis, John Less's, the relation of John Less, which I know, they just hedged in some mountain.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
What might, Bert Morgan, with salmon across the sea, good Lord.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Good Lord.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
I think that could be Garonry Davis.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Well, Rita Qualley, that's Sir Kinsey Morgan, yeah, of course, well, you know that, Jill.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Yes, I know.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And Short, the man shouldn't name her Short.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
He was the secretary.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Good Lord, yes.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And I remember Kinsey Morgan.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Fred Buffton, yeah, Fred Buffton, yeah.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
He looked a bit familiar.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Gosh, there are a lot of people there.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Are we remembering?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I remember Kinsey Morgan becoming the high sheriff.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Oh, yeah, Kinsey was a big man.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And all the children in Rattner Shire, all the children in Rattner Shire, they were all very good people.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And all the children in Rattner Shire had a brand new, bright, shiny, I think it was a shilling.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Good creation.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Everybody had a shilling.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Good creation.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Yes, when he became high sheriff.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Yeah, and then I remember him.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Jack George, the Slytherin's and Taman.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Oh, look.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Good Lord, yes.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
I know a few of those, yeah.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Fred Buffton, this is a winning street.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
He was a driver, was he? Did he drive for the...

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Yeah, he used to drive a lot.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
He was in an accident with John Humphries's brother.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Yeah, that was a tragedy.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Yeah, he ran into the back of Fred Buffton.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Down the road and he had had a Fred, yeah.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Oh, gosh.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Waiting down here.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I remember waiting down here in the film.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
What was that?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000
About 1920, oh.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Pengraig, yes.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Well, that would be more Newbridge way, I suppose.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Markhamerade, it's a little bit Newbridge anyway.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
There's a little bit of Pengraig in this.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Um...

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Oh, Pengraig again.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Right.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Reeds is there.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
The chapel of Dillon Valley.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Lovely, yes.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Oh, that's...

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
down about Llandle Tholay for that, isn't it?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And then there's the corner shop, of course.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Yeah.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Do you remember Mrs. Griffiths?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Yes, yes.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Molly Griffiths, wasn't it?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Yes, that's right.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Yeah, my mum used to speak highly of her.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
John, hello.
