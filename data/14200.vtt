Landshut Major Coast Guard Training

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In the bottom meadow nearest to the beach at Landshut Major,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
there used to be a pole with cross arms attached to it,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
which represented a ship's mast.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This was used by the Coast Guards to practise rescue procedures.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
One end of a rope was attached to the pole,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
a Boatswain's chair would be fitted onto the rope,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and the other end of the rope would be connected to a tripod

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and pegged down to the ground.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The children of Landshut Major had great fun,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
racing up from the beach to see who could be the first to climb to the top of the pole.
