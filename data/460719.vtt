00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.320
We had an extra neighbour who was an invalid, wheelchair bound, and he was the first one,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.560
I'm sure in the whole village, who had a television.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.320
And he just happened to live next door.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:23.120
So my dad and I used to pop in there several evenings a week to watch it.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.120
A little 15 inch Phillips in the corner, black and white of course.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.480
But, and everything was exciting wasn't it, you know, whatever was on.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.760
The programs were only on in the evening, no daytime television in those days.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.760
If you ask me what stands out, I can't remember, because I would have been about

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:01.920
you know, seven, up to about 15, I can't remember.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.680
But I couldn't get over the excitement of actually watching things.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.840
One of the things, I remember one of the programs that I still remember today,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.440
there was a program about the end of the war, and a news bulletin or a news reel

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.400
on the concentration camps.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.400
And I remember my dad standing in front of the screen so that I couldn't see the horrors.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.960
And that sticks with me today.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.280
If you ask me what else was on, I couldn't tell you.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.160
Because there was no, even then I was really keen on sport.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.720
But I can't remember any sport being on.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.440
Perhaps the FA Cup final, but that was about it, you know.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.440
Oh I do remember, yeah, what I do remember was children's programs.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.480
Andy Pandy, Muffin the Mew, a bit later on, Sucky, you know.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.040
Those, but perhaps those were the only things that were on I suppose.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.360
And the other thing I remember was the, there was always, there was the intermission.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.480
Unless the screen was there.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.320
And you just sit there watching that, thinking what, you know, there's a picture across there,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.440
there was nothing happening on it.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.240
Yeah, that was the one thing.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:41.120
And then I also remember, my dad sang in the Trio O'Kimena West Choir.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.680
And in those days, they used to do BBC, used to do it, only BBC of course.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.320
Used to do an outside broadcast, Kamu is called, out and about or something.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.520
And the choir had gone to Trichnum to watch wheels play in England.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.720
And the TV had covered their trip.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.200
And after the match, it was live, I only remember it was live,

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.800
them interviewing some members of the choir about the game.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.560
And there was my dad.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.920
And they said to him, can you tell us anything?

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.920
And my dad said, well you got so excited, he said, well Wales scored.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.360
I bought a new cap to go to the match.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.680
And I threw it up in the air, he said.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.440
You know, like everybody did in those days.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.800
I lost it.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.960
And I remember him telling the TV interviewer,

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.600
I get in big trouble when I get home from my wife.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.680
Because she only bought me that cap to go away.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.160
So yeah.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.240
And that would have been in the 1950s?

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.440
Yeah, that would have been the late 50s.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.920
Around about, no, perhaps mid 50s probably.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.080
50, 54, 55 perhaps.
