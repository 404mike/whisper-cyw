So, your mother and father when they moved into Savannah, were they farming the land at the time or did they just move in to keep the house going.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Well, my father was a lecturer at the college college powers.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:35.000
But because he, he'd never, he'd never been a farmer, but because he'd been brought up on the farm, and I've got old pictures as one of him on a tractor or sitting on a trailer with one of his brothers on the tractor.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
When they were kids, well, you know, late teens I suppose.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:59.000
He decided that he would farm the land because it was either that I suppose or rented out to somebody else to farm it so he kind of farmed it and mum helped and worked full time at the college as well.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
But he used to love it you know he'd be spending every day like minute he'd be up with the lark.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
He'd be out doing some farming then he'd go off to work and then he'd come back and he'd be out, you know, do some more farming.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And my younger brother was here as well so he'd have been sort of, I don't know, what would it be, 12 something like that.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
12 or 13 so he would be helping as well. And of course he's now farming Savannah.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So he, so dad had a little bit of help but yeah he tended to, he was very busy, very busy man, very capable and so, so yes they did take on the farming.
