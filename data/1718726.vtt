00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760
So the house that you're living in now was part of the estate, the Billit's estate, is that right?

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.720
Yes indeed.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.080
Yeah, built when?

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.600
This one's 1868. So they seem to have building periods with the various estates.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.640
The land here is quite unusual because effectively there's only been three

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.240
three ownerships of the land since the dissolution.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.040
Eventually the crown sold off the land here to a chap called William Fowler who was from Shrewsbury,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.520
he was the provost of Shrewsbury, quite an important man on the council of the marches,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.920
and he was a serial buyer of monastic land. He lived at a place called Harnage Grange in

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.360
Shropshire which was formerly part of Bedford's survey, and he bought in 1665.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:05.760
His family, his successors, were here tottering on and his estate eventually collapsed about 1820.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.600
Then Thomas Wilson came who was a London solicitor, seemed to be quite a go-ahead sort of chap,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.920
and what we can see from the records got himself into a deal with Lord Portman to build a market

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.840
in what we would now call Portman Street in London, and went bankrupt. So he went off to

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:35.120
Australia to Adelaide where he became, he was the second mayor of Adelaide, so he made a new

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.960
life for himself, very successful, and we still have some contact with his descendants in Australia,

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:50.080
and that's a nush within the Phillips family who were mill owners in Stockport, and they were here

00:01:50.080 --> 00:02:01.040
until 1959 when this property was sold out of the estate. The two houses were sold and bought by

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.080
a well-known local character called Mercer Griffiths who lived in the house next door to me,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.200
and she bought both houses. He bought one because she wanted some accommodation for her parents,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.840
and she thought she might live in the other one. Well, this one was £350

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.160
because it had a bit more land next door which was only £300. That's the history of these two houses.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:38.720
The build time is the 1860s which was quite significant because the Phillips were

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.840
obviously very proactive on the estate at that time, which was certainly not true of

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.840
many of the years when the Fowlers were here. The estate seemed to be very badly managed from

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.400
about 1750 onwards and went into a long, long period of decline, but the Phillips were

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.840
initially absent landlords, most of them were absentee landlords most of the time, and they

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.680
really dropped to grips from the 1850s onwards, and they did a lot of building and rebuilding.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:23.360
The first estate houses they built were the Lye who went on to comprise

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.640
their little pairs of cottages.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.880
They would go back to 1840s shortly after they arrived, but their main expansion seemed to have

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:47.680
been in the 1860s when they built schools, they built three pairs of houses like this,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:56.880
this pair which eventually became Piccadilly. I'm not quite sure why Piccadilly, except that

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.480
I think they had connections with what I suspect they had a London home in Piccadilly because two

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:10.480
of their children were christened in St James's Church Piccadilly, Paddock down near the Union,

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.960
and the Cymdee cottage, if you come across Cymdee cottage up at the back end of the valley,

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.880
up towards Brookersany, that's been converted into a single house.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.560
These were 1860s. What was the purpose of the estate building for workers presumably?

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:42.560
For workers, yes, certainly these were quite large by the standards of the time.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.200
The Wernock cottage and Lye cottage was another pair of cottages as you see coming into the village.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:56.240
It's now one, were very small. At one time there was about 12 people living in one of the Lye

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:05.120
cottages which is two up, two down, no privy up the backs of the thing, so it was relatively basic.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:13.440
But these were better. Also in the 1850s they rebuilt the Abbey farms, it was known,

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:20.480
which we now call Home Farm, and that was the model farm for the estate and there were all

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.080
the best practices of agriculture were on display there. There's a splendid range of buildings,

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.720
coach house, coachman's accommodation, stabling, etc etc, wonderful buildings, but sadly

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.400
not fit for purpose anymore for modern agriculture.
