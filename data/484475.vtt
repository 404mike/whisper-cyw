00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.800
Interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.840
The venue is the Swicker office.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.360
Today's date is Friday the 16th of January 2015.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.280
Our interviewee is Adrian Wiggins.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.160
Adrian, for the record, would you please spell your name in four?

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.480
A-D-R-I-A-N

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.160
W-I-W-G-I-N-S

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.520
Thank you very much indeed.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.680
Adrian, what's your earliest Cardiff Carnival memory?

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.400
It's a tricky one that really.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.840
I think my earliest one would be

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.760
when I first started drumming with Sam McGillis

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.240
and there was a guy that came in called Sam Alexander

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.080
who's a very good friend of mine still to this day.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.000
And I learnt the art of Maraca 2.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.760
And one of my earliest memories was

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.480
learning Maraca 2 in this room and somebody coming in going,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.400
knocking on the door, coming in saying,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.120
this is Maraca 2, could you tell me where Maraca 1 is?

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.920
That was good.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.480
I'm just...

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.160
This day is still a good joke.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.920
Yeah, and then...

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.240
I think I had my first blister from drumming Maraca 2

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.240
and parading onto the Hayes,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.640
which is now St David's too, unfortunately.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:47.560
And it's just been gross by the whole Carnival thing and drumming.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:56.520
My first memory of drumming was actually at Channel View.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.520
Walking along with my kids and hearing this drumming

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.640
and it dragging me into the room

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.840
and I didn't realise at the time, but looking back,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.280
that was a door into a new world for me.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.760
And seeing this drumming and thinking, I want to do this.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.080
And I think you were there, actually.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.320
Very probably.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.160
Maybe going, come on in, come on in.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.560
And then that was that.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.680
It's true to say that in terms of the community percussion and the samba,

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.000
I think that both your daughters followed in your footsteps.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.480
All of them.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.360
All my three girls, yeah, they've all gone.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.400
In fact, I could put a group together with them quite easily.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.280
And I've used them as ringers in the past for different things.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.200
I heard of Von Trapp singers, but the Von Trapp drummers is a new one on me.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.360
Yeah, that would be a good one.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.440
So, yeah, lots of memories of Carnival.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.080
And when you contacted me to come in and do this,

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.760
I've been thinking about various things.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.680
And in our conversation before, I'm just remembering when it started

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.560
and when it finished.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.040
And I think the first...

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.680
So when I first started playing was under the tutelage of Sam

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.400
and Chris and Simon, with Samba Glez.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.400
And then I think my first year as a leader would have been around

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.920
about probably about 92 or 93.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.440
And I fell in, fell into teaching, really.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.400
Actually, funnily enough,

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.040
a memory just came to my head, was at Katae's Community Centre.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.000
So I just got so engrossed in the drumming

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.320
and just found that I could pick it up and run with it.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.080
And I think there was one particular day

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.200
Chris or Sam wasn't there.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.920
And somebody came into the room and said,

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.000
Oh, how does that rhythm go?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.440
And I went, Oh, it goes like this.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.160
I don't really know how to teach.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.200
And somebody said, Well, you're teaching now.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.360
And that was the first time I'd ever taught anybody, you know,

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.160
because I just did it. It was just me.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.240
That was the first time I passed on my knowledge to somebody else

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.120
and without realising, you know.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.680
And from then on, I just became a teacher of drumming.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.680
You know.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.280
Obviously, costumes are a huge part of Carnival as well.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.720
And you used to get involved in the making of costumes.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.120
Do any come to mind when you think of, well, on the one hand,

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.600
costumes that you and your percussion band have worn on parade

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.640
or others that stick in your mind from past Carnival?

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.760
There's a few, actually.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.480
I think the most famous one, the ones that looked great

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.160
were the skeleton outfits or the skellies, as we call them.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.280
Took us weeks to make them.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.600
And Sally and myself were just there constantly printing them out.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.480
And I think we printed front and back about 20 skeleton outfits,

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.400
which we then kept hold of and used them for our own performances.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.160
I think that was our first proper

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.200
Carnival performance as repercussion street band.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.440
And yes, so that and we think we also had

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.560
headpieces as well, which are really uncomfortable to wear.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.920
So those are great because they were Lycra leggings

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:02.240
and they glow or fluorescent scully out for printing.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.920
And I think then there was one year where we had to do these barcodes,

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.520
which were the most fiddliest bloody thing.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.800
I had to sew bits of plastic onto

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.640
the same sort of leggings and T-shirts with these really intricate.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.240
It took ages to put these things together.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.040
And really fiddly.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.440
We got them all together and we got out onto the street

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.920
and it was pissing down the rain, excuse the language.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.200
And within about five minutes, it fell apart.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.520
A classic carnival tradition.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.520
Disintegrating costumes.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.200
And we were just I think you were you were actually trying to hold off the carnival.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.320
We were trying to find a window of opportunity to get onto the street.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.280
It was like, right, let's just go for it.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.480
And we got onto the street.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.640
And that was one of my earliest memories of drumming in the rain

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.520
and helped by an ample amount of rum.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.840
And just embracing the weather, you know, and just.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.080
Do you find when it's raining?

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.200
I can remember the first time it ever rained on a carnival.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.080
I think it was 1991 that we were passing the haze

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.600
and Sam was leaving the band at the time.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.280
And he looked at me and fair play to him.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.320
He just started shouting and screaming.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.920
And I can remember him poguing, jumping up and down like a mad thing.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.640
And of course, the band responded to this.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.320
Because the band pushed it up.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.480
It's all like, you know, nothing's going to stop us.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.160
Yeah, all the masqueraders, the revelers and the audience stayed with it.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.840
And I remember thinking, God bless you, Sam.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.040
And you've shown us what our response to rain is,

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.240
which is to go to take it to the sixth gear, to really go completely.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.960
You know, this is the.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.760
Yeah, definitely. I've played.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.560
I've done many a parade in the rain

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.480
and performed abroad in France with my band.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.800
And it's rained and instead of getting down by it,

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.160
you just you up it and go above and beyond and just embrace it and shout

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.320
and give off, you give off the energy, your band responds to it.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.080
The crowd responds to it.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.640
The band responds to that and you just spiral up.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.240
Yeah. Yeah.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.120
I can't stand that. Yeah, yeah, definitely.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.640
So, yeah, I mean, I prefer not to play in the rain.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.400
This is Wales. This is Wales.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.800
It does happen. Yeah.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.840
Obviously, percussion's played the last part of your life.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.960
You know, what do you do now?

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.760
How have you sort of gone from that very first?

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.120
I love seeing the idea of your hearing.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.160
Samba, perhaps live for the first time,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.480
percussion live for the first time, becoming into Channel View.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.760
And that just, you know, it was like it was like an entity

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.680
dragging me into that room and change my life.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.880
The force was strong.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.080
It was and changed my life forever.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.520
I would not be doing what I'm doing now if it wasn't.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.680
I don't think it was a chance encounter.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.840
I think I would have gotten to what I'm doing now. Yeah.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.920
But I do think that I think about it quite a lot.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.640
How? At what point I would have got into it,

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.240
because I'm actually member seeing some of the layers playing in the haze.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.920
Probably a few months before that, and I hadn't long moved to Cardiff.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.400
And just am ambling around, you know, not really having a direction.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.080
I mean, what I was doing, nothing really.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.800
I'd moved from Brecon to Cardiff and didn't really know many people.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.400
And I remember seeing a bunch of hippies, degenerates,

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.160
or whatever they looked like, you know,

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.360
hitting bits of whatever they were.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.320
I had no clue what they were doing.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.080
You know, it's just been enthralled and intrigued by

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.360
by and how it all came together.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.160
And and then that was that.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.080
And I thought, OK, whatever, as you do.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.280
And then and then this one particular day,

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.040
but in Channel View and hearing this drumming and

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.160
and like the entity bringing me in and opening this door to this world,

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.440
which I I'm I am now.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.480
And that was probably.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.880
Well, that's got to be about 24 years ago then.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.680
Or more. That's crazy.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.480
And now I.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.960
You know, I teach Samba as a team building

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.040
session, you know, all over Europe and the world.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.640
And I'm a professional musician.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.480
I like to think that quite good at what I do.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.000
And I'm forever, forever grateful for for that opportunity.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.160
Well, I think on that note, Adrian Williams, thank you very much.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.960
You're welcome. For the interview.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.000
And what? It's just been great fun. Yeah.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.160
Which is great. Thanks, Steve.
