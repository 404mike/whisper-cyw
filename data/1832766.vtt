00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
While still in Aberystwyth, I did come across some anti-Semitism in an extraordinary form.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
A fellow student in my year, Osgur Jan of Jocko's Slam Christ, had been a younger man,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
full of enthusiasm for Hitler and all his ideas and ideals.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
He had been in Germany and worked for the Arab Ice Fiends, but came back from a year or two doing this

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
in order to pursue his studies, and then the war broke out, and he joined the army.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
He was a Spitzes official and joined the army.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And one of the maneuvers that he was on, he had a shot himself in the foot of,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
he shot his big toe off, or his big toe was lost somewhere.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And so he was in the lead of the army, and partly because of his worthwhile convictions,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and partly because he resented the British army for having got him to lose his toe.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:19.000
He reverted to this, or took up again his original ideas of the high-in-faith and racial superiority and all that,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and spouted this publicly when he realized that it upset me, because apart from that,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
we had been colleagues and friends in the same group for only about six or seven hours an hour a year from John.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
He said, well, you know, you're all right. You know the argument, you're all right, it's all the other Jews.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And I remembered there, because of the way he spoke, one couldn't actually argue against him,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
because there was nothing tangible to argue, it was an attitude which was so entrenched,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and so profoundly ill thought out, but certainly at that stage, there was nothing, I felt there was nothing I could do about Stan Price.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So I remember I walked down to the beach, I don't know if you know Aberystwyth, but it's a pebbly beach, not a sandy beach,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and I sat on the pebbles and wrecked into the sea. I was just so frustrated and so upset,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
thinking that here I'd come away from this thing only to meet it again.
