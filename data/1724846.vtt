00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
How about you Stephen?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Well just companionship. It's a friend to get out and about and go on holidays and meet other people.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.000
They help me to show it out. Linda's good on advice, she's really sensible so 50-50 help me to show it out, different ways.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000

And he's pretty good.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Are there any other things that he does to help you?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
He's seen going out and shopping and going out and about.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
What do you like to do together? What do you enjoy doing together?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We like going out with our friends on a Saturday.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And we go to the pub.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We like going out with our friends on a Saturday.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And we go to Cwrn Bran.

We go to Cwrn Bran and places like that.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And we go on holiday together don't we?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Yeah, being at the corner in Ooki.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Ooki Cornwell.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Being at the Cribbs Causeway.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Yeah.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And where do you stay when you go to other places?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Good old town.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Old town.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Old town yeah.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And we enjoy it. It's really nice.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And you travelled down together?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Yeah.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And how did you get there?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Best coach.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Coach.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Best Edmonds travel.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So we get the cart.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Logging is located in Blackwood.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Running Cardiff and he was running Newport.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And then we get to find out when the times the best suit us.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And I was going to take him to Jersey.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
He should never have been there.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I'd been at the Jersey Channel Islands.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
But we were going to go by plane.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
But my brother said she's a bit overweight.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
He wouldn't let her fly out the Canada.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And I was going to go take Linda if that was stopped.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Why not?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Because of the weak situation.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So who set that fact away?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
My brother.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Your brother?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Oh my.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And are there other things that your brother sort of suggest you should and shouldn't do?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I'm not sure.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And when you go on holiday together what kind of things do you do?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
We like shopping.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Shopping.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Things like that.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Yeah.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
He likes his swimming.
