00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Okay, furlough.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Right then, Amy, what's it like to be on furlough?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I was quite surprised that I was going to go on furlough.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I know lots of people across the country were talking about it, but I hadn't known that we were planning it at Sillip.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But when it did come up, I wasn't surprised or particularly offended or anything.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
They were quite careful to make sure that none of us felt we'd been singled out.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It never occurred to me that I wasn't essential to make sure the company existed.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So that bit of it was fine.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It was a bit sudden though, so I just set up this website for the record

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and was planning to do all sorts of things during Covid-19 and the lockdown, which had just started.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And suddenly that was all kind of stopped.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So there was a little bit of feeling of loss there.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But yeah, then it was fine.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I worked two days a week in another job anyway on the Monday and Tuesday.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So by the time we got to Wednesday, yeah, I was sort of looking forward to having the time off.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Right. And what did you do?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I did a couple of things.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I thought I'd have loads of time, like lots of people thought they'd have tons of time to do all sorts of things.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The two things I really committed to were I transcribed five interviews that I'd done with some colleagues in my other job.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And I knew needed to do.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And I like transcription.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I do voluntary transcription for the National Library of Wales.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And I just hadn't been I hadn't had time to do anything like that for a very long time.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So I really enjoyed just doing that for sort of about half a day because it takes much, much longer than you think.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So it's about an hour to do 10 minutes worth of conversation.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Then the other thing that I really put my efforts into was drawing.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So you taught me you started giving me some lessons in drawing, which I've never done before.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And I tried to do a little bit of that each day.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
But at the same time, it was also really sunny.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
It was hot. It was like March and April.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So was it March? No, it was April. It was April and May.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
It was really sunny.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And also our dog, Millie, who features elsewhere on this site, was pretty poorly.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And we were looking after her.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
What's the word to describe palliative care?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And she absolutely adored the sunshine.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So every spare minute we'd have to get her outside and sit in the sunshine and let her roll around on the grass.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And yeah, just spending lots of time with her.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And did the drawing relax you at all?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Or was it a surprise that you enjoyed it so much because you became very good at it?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Not relaxing. I sort of thought of it as work.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
But I did very I really enjoyed it. I was very slow at it.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I was very slow at most things, but I did enjoy it.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So it was a challenge? Yeah.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
What have you missed on furlough?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I don't think I really missed anything.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
It did though, I suppose.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I felt a bit that we had a WhatsApp group with all the furloughed staff.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So we wouldn't literally none of us looked at any emails, except on the specific days and times we had been told we were going to get a message.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And the WhatsApp was nice because I as a remote worker, I don't know many of the other people.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.000
So I didn't contribute much, but it was really nice to kind of hear from everybody and know, you know, feel like you're you weren't alone.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And then, you know, feeling quite bad for the people who were still in the office who had to carry a lot of the weight of the work that we weren't doing.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Do you think there's been any lasting effects to having to change how you work?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I think what's interesting about the experience is that it was like this lovely opportunity to have all this time,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:29.000
but that that also makes you think about your career and what you spend your time doing in the office normally and how important it is or isn't.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And then kind of how much of that is your identity?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And I suspect lots of people have have thought about those, especially people who didn't have a job and another job like I did.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
It was probably in a meta sort of way, a bit discombobulating.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Is that the word? Yeah.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
OK, thank you.
