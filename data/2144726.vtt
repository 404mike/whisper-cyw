00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
I've been with Mencap 22 years now.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.360
I'm a colourful character.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:15.960
I've known Jan Kanch and some of those guys for years and years because Jan Kanch organises

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.880
the Mencap discos and dinners and then they do Gateway in Abera on which I've also been

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.880
to.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.240
But I belong to the Gateway up here in Aberystwyth.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:35.440
She was doing self-advocacy and I was doing advocacy group with the centres.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:44.720
She used to come and be in the buildings and just be an advocate for people that had problems

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:51.520
and you know just be a voice for people to chat to.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.400
So we used to have meeting groups in the centres.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.440
Anything from parking issues to access.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.480
But how they had advocacy came about was through a lady called Claire Turner.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:15.040
She was with People First and that was my involvement during the 90s.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:22.760
I think my proudest moment was being a rep at the old Wales People First.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:30.400
It was about, for me, I always thought it was about working together as a team.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.920
But quite often nobody would like to take out on the responsibility.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.160
So they used to come and see me and I'd say yeah I'll do it but then I realised hang on

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.080
a minute I needed help here to actually make this happen.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:58.840
So that's why I got a bit stressed towards the end and I just thought I've done with this.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.480
I did that for six years.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:09.120
I chaired one group down in Aberon but I thought I couldn't do it anymore because I had to

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.880
have a fish to fry if you like.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:24.880
I'm a keen swimmer and a keen musician and I'm an author, activist.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:37.040
I just hope that I was able to make a change in some way even if it's very small.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.080
I went into Daycentre Services to start with.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:54.800
I did that for 20 years but when I moved up here in 2005 I didn't want to do that anymore.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:04.120
So I was one of the first people in Curydeacon to have direct payments.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.200
If I've got problems I can always talk to Jan.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:19.680
Well I played music for them and I've done some drumming and I've performed for them.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:28.880
They got open day or something or if I get asked would you like to be a part of an event

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.880
they're organising.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.760
Yeah I know Beth and Dylan.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.960
They will often ring and say can we come out, we want to come out and see you.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.080
We haven't seen you for ages, can we have a cash out?

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.080
Yes come on in.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.840
I wasn't very good at learning.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:01.960
However when it was music day and swimming day I enjoyed doing them.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.760
Swimming because it gives me freedom to move freely in the water.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:16.600
Music because I find music therapy for me and it helps keep my fingers going.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.840
We all meet up once a year and everybody comes and it's just oh well we haven't seen you

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.120
for ages, how have you been doing?

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.120
And these events usually go on until about 11.30.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:43.680
This time at the Moody Cow but in the past at Seaglin Christmas summer, well it's Christmas

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:51.560
Christmas dinner, Christmas food or ice cream or something.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:05:01.280
And then they have one in the summer which could be I don't know chicken, anything really.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:10.920
It gives us a chance to meet all our friends again and everybody goes and it is busy, busy.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.600
You can't always move around in there, there's so many people.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.320
They're all my friends as far as I'm concerned.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.800
You know even people I haven't met before.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:34.360
I've always wanted to be out there as a person with a disability even though I kid myself

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.200
I don't have a disability.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.320
It doesn't stop me.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.320
It does not stop me.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:54.680
Hygienx is a physical acting agency that takes people with non-disability and disability

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:04.280
and trains them to become actors and actresses and teaches you about film techniques and

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.920
acting for screen and for theatre.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:16.720
We do all sorts of play games and silly characters role play.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:26.240
At the minute they're working with doctors so they're doing a lot of role play down in

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.560
Cardiff with the doctors.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.920
I've been involved with Unity Festival down in Clenechie.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:46.120
Unity Festival is a big festival that brings all the Hygienx academies together but there

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:52.840
are about three or four not yet.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:59.400
What you do is you work on a show and then you take it to something like the Unity Festival

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.880
and perform it.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.200
So it's a street theatre.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:14.640
You get to meet all sorts of different people and what is nice there, there's always different

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:21.120
tutors that come in because I'm involved with the mid academy up here in Aberystwyth which

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.600
meets every Monday at half nine to half three.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.720
So it's a full on day.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.320
Two years we didn't do it because of Covid.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:45.480
Unfortunately it puts a stop on things because I've done a lot of stuff.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:52.560
When you chat to people and tell them what you do they just go oh bloody hell you put

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.240
me to shame.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:05.000
My proudest moment is being able to be on stages playing or doing dance or doing Hygienx

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.560
or but what does keep me going is music.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:19.520
I've always been surrounded by music and good people.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:25.040
I was lacking in confidence at some points in my life.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:34.320
Both with Menkepke, Deacon, Peoplefest and the groups that I was involved with in the

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:40.920
day centres has given me a sense of confidence.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:48.400
You can talk to Jan about anything and everything.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:56.200
And if she can't help you then she might be able to give you the right people that you

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.600
can get in touch with.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:04.200
She's another person that gives you the tools to deal with whatever life throws at you.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:11.600
It's just wonderful to have Jan and Menkepke ready to give you the help.
