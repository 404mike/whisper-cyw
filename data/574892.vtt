Recollections of Hugh Parry. The Welsh have many common names so they use nicknames to distinguish each other.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In Seattle we had many Griffiths, William Griffith Ballard and William Griffith Ward Street.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Then there was a Williams delicatessen and Williams butter and egg because he had a butter and egg stall at Pike Market.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Thomas Evans Post Office, Mrs John Hughes West Seattle and Mrs John Hughes Queen Anne Hill.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We had a lot of Joneses at the church. There were eight Jack Jones and a Jones the painter.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.000
One John Jones was called Johnny Wine not because he was a drinker but because he came from the Wine Valley in North Wales.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Everybody in the Welsh community knew Annie Jones. She was the mother of Tudor Ted Jones who built the Slow Mo Hydroplane.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
She was a great organiser of everything and an organist at the church.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
She was constantly putting on programs. People would see her coming and run.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But she would track them down and get them to say yes. You couldn't say no to Annie Jones.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
In Annie's later years she suffered some hearing loss and to compensate she'd pull the stops out on the pump organ.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
If you were unlucky and you screwed up in Sunday school you would have to go up there and pump the organ.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Well, if you goofed off and forgot to pump he would run out of air and he wouldn't play too well.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Annie would have a living fit right there in church. I pumped that thing many times.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Thank you.
