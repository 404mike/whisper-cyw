00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600
97 results, the pollution reference results, did you stay up to watch? Were you somewhere

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:16.680
else? No, I didn't stay up to watch. By the end, actually, I felt curiously detached from

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:26.360
it. And it was probably because I'd been so intensely involved in drafting the settlements

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:36.680
that I was tired of it by then. I remember that very well. And up to my eyeballs in legislation

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:48.960
going through, especially about universities. So I didn't stay up and I didn't really appreciate

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.600
the drama of how close it was. I mean, I think I understood the importance of it as far as

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.760
the government was concerned. Because if we had have lost that vote, that would have been

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:11.960
a big early defeat. And whenever later I have criticised the Welsh Assembly, because I'm

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:21.360
quite disappointed in it really. I don't think it's made us a better country. Significantly,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.720
anyway. My wife, Ilyesola, says to me, just shut up, right? You had a chance to voice

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.400
your opposition to it and you didn't even have the balls to vote against it in the privacy

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:46.320
of a polling booth. She knows, does she? She says the same thing to Paul Murphy, but well.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.800
When you woke up the next day, therefore, was it a surprise to you that it had been

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:59.200
carried? No, no, no. I thought we would win it. But I was surprised at how close it was.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.800
I don't know whether it's true or not, but these stories about Ron Davis going home,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:14.120
didn't he? And he started to drive home and ready to resign, presumably. Probably lost

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:23.200
the vote. We'll never find out. No, we will never find out. Finally. He worked down the

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:31.640
hard road, but he really did. He threw everything into it. It must have been a very scary time

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.360
for him, I'd have thought.
