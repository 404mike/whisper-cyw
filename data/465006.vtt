00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.400
Yes, I do. I think I was probably at work in college here because it broke the news,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.120
broke sort of first thing in the morning. And as it happened one of my colleagues, one

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:29.840
of the other lecturers, came from Aberfan and actually lived in the area where the land

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:46.120
slip occurred. And so, you know, there was this immediate link which heightened the

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.640
impact of it. But yes, I can remember it very clearly. I can remember the pictures and so

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:02.400
forth. And as it happened, a few years afterwards, a colleague and I were going down for an academic

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:11.600
board in Cardiff and we went via Aberfan to have a look at the site and where she had

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:24.320
lived and to see, you know, the relationship to the landslips. Yes, that made a great impact.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.000
I think it was bound to do. I mean, it was such an appalling tragedy involving all those

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:44.720
children. Yes. And I think you needed the visual impact particularly to appreciate how

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:54.960
destructive it was. Can you remember anything specific that you saw in the coverage? Well,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:03.920
I can remember seeing obviously shots of the slip itself which actually came literally

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:19.680
to the road where this colleague lived or had the family house. I can remember certain incidents

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:28.000
like, for example, there was a minister from one of the non-conformist chapels who lost his children

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:38.640
in this disaster but who went round other bereaved families consistently and obviously tried to

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:53.440
help in the attempts to rescue, you know. And also later on, the cemetery which was

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:01.640
built for them or set up for them on the hillside above the town where all the children were

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:10.520
buried together. And there was, of course, a lot of follow-up about the collection in

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.040
aid for the families and what was going to happen to it and so forth. So it was something

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:23.960
which was constantly in the news for quite a considerable time. The coverage brought

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:30.280
Aberfan to the world's attention. Yes. What effect did you think that had? Well, I suppose

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:38.840
it must have had a greater awareness of the need for precautions to prevent this happening

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:48.440
again. Whether, in fact, I mean how effective that was, I don't know, but it must have had

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.040
that effect and presumably not only in this country because the same thing could very

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:03.680
easily happen and similar things have happened elsewhere, haven't they? I can't think of

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.360
any specific examples because I didn't know anybody in that world, so to speak. Do you

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.360
think the coverage conveyed the feeling in Aberfan? Oh yes, I think it did. I think there

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:24.520
was a very powerful impact. I mean people reporting from there were obviously, presenters

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:31.600
were obviously upset themselves and you could hardly fail to be, could you, in the circumstances.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.880
Yes, I thought that atmosphere came over very powerfully.
