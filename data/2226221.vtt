00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000
1938, Nazi Germany. As the dust settles in the aftermath of the Kristallnacht pogrom,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.760
a train of child refugees approaches the Dutch border. Evelyn Kay, a young Jewish girl from

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.360
Vienna, sits nervously on board.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:30.360
When the announcement happened, everyone made a noise. They'd stopped the train and turned us off the train.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:39.360
And then the Gestapo got on at the border, and they said if we had any gold, we had to give it to the Gestapo,

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:48.360
otherwise they'd tear us off the train. And I had this lovely signet ring and the bracelets, which I didn't know where,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:56.360
and I put it into the seat of the train, and it had disappeared. I could never find it again.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:05.360
In July 1939, another child refugee, Renata Collins, arrives in London from Prague.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:15.360
When I got to Liverpool Street Station, my foster father, he was there waiting for me, and he was a Baptist minister.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.360
He had a black hat, black suit, black coat, and of course a minister's collar.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.360
And they just took me up to him, I caught hold of his hand, and I went with him.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.360
I can't imagine how a child nowadays would go, but he just smiled at me and off we went.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:44.360
By the middle of 1939, it was clear to many Jews in Central Europe that they were no longer safe in their own homes and workplaces.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:55.360
The annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia, alongside a vicious pogrom in November 1938, prompted many Jews to flee the German Reich.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.360
This was no easy task, since few countries around the world were willing to accept them.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.360
Some, however, managed to escape to Britain and to Wales.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.360
I'm Maurice Brodie, historian at Aberystwyth University.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:25.360
In this second episode of The Holocaust and Wales, we look at the perilous journeys taken by refugees to get to Wales.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:34.360
How did they leave Central Europe? What barriers did they face? And how was their journey into the unknown?

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:46.360
For Klaus Ascher, later Colin Anson, who lived in Aberdove in Gwinev during the war, the spark for leaving was a tragic one.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:54.360
His father had been murdered by the Nazis in Dachau concentration camp in 1937 for speaking out against the regime.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.360
Making the decision to flee was just one of many challenges facing potential refugees.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.360
After my father was killed, it became obvious that there wouldn't be much of a future for me.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:15.360
And all manner of avenues were explored for integrating here, there and everywhere.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:26.360
There was an uncle of my half-sister, and this uncle was going to Cuba and we were trying to get the necessary documentation.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:36.360
It was a scramble by all sorts of people, mostly Jewish people, trying to get out of the country in circumstances when it was being made very difficult to get out.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:43.360
And there was an enormous weight of red tape and many obstacles to overcome.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.360
Some refugees had family in Britain who could help them escape.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:57.360
Laura Confino, who was eventually evacuated to Wales, was living in Frankfurt in 1938.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:05.360
And my father then phoned our family in England.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:18.360
And he phoned them up and he said, look here, you must help her to get Laura to help to come to you, because it would be either now or never.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.360
And so they managed to get all the papers together.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:37.360
And I remember in Frankfurt itself, I mean, there were long queues of Jews all needing to have their papers stamped and everything got ready for them to leave.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.360
And there was a lot of fear and nervousness.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.360
And I remember the queues and you had to stand and wait.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.360
And then it was all very, very stressful.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.360
And eventually I got permission to leave.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.360
The main problem for refugees was to find a country that would let them in.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:08.360
For hundreds of thousands of potential refugees, the door to safety was firmly shut.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.360
In Britain, one of the few ways to get a visa was to find a job as a domestic servant, like a housekeeper.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:28.360
Fanny Höchstetter from Loutheim in Germany managed to escape after her sister, Bertil, got her a job as a domestic servant in the Wirral, where she had managed to flee herself.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.360
Fanny then moved to Llangollen.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:40.360
Bertil first tried to get a visa for the US with the help of a famous relative, Carl Lemle, living in California.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.360
Here's Ernie Hunter, Fanny's son.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:58.360
And Bertil wrote to him and almost by return post, she got a one million dollar affidavit from Carl Lemle, a guarantee that she would not be a burden on the American state.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:06.360
Bertil went to the consulate, the American consulate in Stuttgart, with this document which you had to hand in.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:17.360
She got a number and Bertil realized the number was going to take two or more years to get to because there were annual quotas in addition to the entry requirements.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.360
And she didn't think she's going to last that long.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:29.360
So she placed an advert in the Times for a domestic job because that's the only work women were allowed to do in the UK to get in.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:36.360
And a Mr. Pritik from Heswell in the Wirral took her on as a housekeeper.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:43.360
Another route for refugees to Britain was to find work as an agricultural labourer.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:50.360
Like domestic servants, the British government deemed farm workers to be in short supply during the 1930s.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:07:01.360
For Herman Rothman, who later worked on farms near Abergalla in north Wales, gaining experience in agricultural work as well as fleeing Germany was a bonus.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:15.360
Herman's family intended to send him to a hachshara, a Jewish training camp to prepare young people for life on a kibbutz, a type of agricultural planned community in what was then the British Mandate of Palestine.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:24.360
My parents thought it is a good idea if I would leave and possibly also my brother.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:42.360
And arrangements were made to apply for to be taken either to Israel or anywhere else because they were advised by their German non-Jewish friends that there is no hope for you at all here.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:47.360
There is nothing here, nothing left. Take and go.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:55.360
They then arranged for me to go on for preparation for emigration to Palestine.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:08.360
But they said you go first to England where you will be trained in agricultural work so that you could have a useful profession when you go to Palestine in those days.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:24.360
Herman, who was 14 at the time, benefited from a policy which allowed unaccompanied child refugees to come to Britain without a visa, provided they were sponsored by friends, family or other charitable organisations.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:30.360
This became known as the Kinder Transport, Children's Transport.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:35.360
Ten thousand children were able to come to the UK under this scheme.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.360
Colin Anson was one of them.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:58.360
It eventually became possible through sponsorship of the Quakers, of the Society of Friends, to get me attached to a Children's Transport on the basis of a temporary transit visa to Britain,

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:15.360
which in turn was founded on the fact that I had applied for immigration into the United States, who would accept the application and give you a waiting number because they would accept immigrants but only a certain quota.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:23.360
The British government was willing to accept refugee children but did not organise the transports themselves.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:32.360
This was the task of the Refugee Children's Movement, an umbrella organisation in the UK as well as organisations in Europe.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:43.360
It was mainly Jewish associations such as the Central British Fund for German Jewry which funded the transports, but some children were supported by non-Jewish groups like the Quakers.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:50.360
£50 was needed for each child's upkeep, around £4,000 in today's money.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:58.360
B. Green, who was later evacuated to Wales, came to Britain through the help of a well-known Anglo-Jewish liberal family.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:17.360
In my case, some friends, in fact I think some distant relatives from Munich, came to Sevenoaks where they met up, I think with a member of the Waley Cohen family who were then, had been liberals, active liberals.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:34.360
And this Waley Cohen woman, being a liberal, was acquainted with a Mrs Williams who was one of the leading lights, an old lady by then, who had already agreed to take a girl from Hamburg.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:56.360
And whether she had second thoughts about having one child, and that perhaps it might be better to have two, or whether she was persuaded by Mrs Waley Cohen, who had spoken to these distant relatives of ours, saying, you know, this is a nice girl, whatever she said, she agreed to my coming to her house provided the £50 were found.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:05.360
The parents of five-year-old Renata Collins from Prague had agreed for her to stay with a couple in Porth, South Wales.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:21.360
I knew where I was coming to in Wales, because if you were under seven, you had to have a home to go to. And I'd got pictures, which I've still got, of where I was going, the people, the husband and wife and the father, grandfather.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:36.360
And they had pictures of me. And I've got letters here that I wrote, went back and forth. And I particularly said, obviously my mother typed the letter, that I hope there was no spinach in England.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:47.360
But if there was plenty of ice cream, I would probably be a very good girl. So I don't know how good I was, because there wasn't much ice cream during the war.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:12:01.360
The last main route through which refugees gained permission to enter Britain was for industrialists who agreed to open factories in pockets of high unemployment, known as special areas.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:13.360
One of these special areas was at Treforest, near Pontypriddh. Des Goulton, son of a factory owner and by then living in Prague, remembers the procedure.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:30.360
So, and then in 1939, there came a mission to Prague from this country, and the mission was sponsored by the Board of Trade.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:47.360
And the purpose of the mission was to invite industrialists to come to this country, particularly to South Wales, to start a factory to employ people.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:55.360
So in August 1939, we came to this country.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:01.360
For those refugees who managed to get permission to leave, there were a number of restrictions.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:08.360
The Nazis were pleased to see Jews leave Germany, but only if they left their assets behind.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:16.360
The government imposed a flight tax on emigration, effectively stealing the savings and property of those leaving the country.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:21.360
For many, leaving the Reich meant starting a new life almost from scratch.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:30.360
Children on the Kindertransport were only allowed to bring with them one suitcase and a small amount of money, ten Reichsmarks.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.360
Bea Green's mother helped her pack.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:42.360
So she packed, I know this sounds very funny now, but she packed my dowry in the sack.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:57.360
So I had initialed sheets and blankets and either gowns, you know, with either no duck or goose feathers or whatever, all in this sack.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:02.360
This was my dowry from when I got married. I was 14 years old then.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:08.360
But this is how my mother thought, you know, she had had a dowry, so her daughter must have a dowry.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:16.360
Herman Rothman, a keen athlete, prioritised sporting prowess over practicality when he packed.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.360
I was only permitted to take a case.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:26.360
And my importance to me was that I had my spikes, my running shoes with me.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:31.360
And anything appertaining to athletics had a priority before anything else.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.360
But I had no winter coat and many other things I had to leave behind.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:44.360
The most common way to leave the German Reich was by train, through the Netherlands and onward to Britain by boat.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:50.360
For children on the Kindertransport, only one parent was permitted at the train station.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:54.360
This was often the last time they ever saw them.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:15:01.360
Julius Veil's class was evacuated from Cologne after their school was destroyed during the Kristallnacht pogrom.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:06.360
His father had already been arrested, so his mother saw him off.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:16.360
Yes, I can see it now. I can see us at the main station called the Hauptbahnhof in Cologne.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:22.360
On a platform getting onto a train, I think it was about three o'clock in the afternoon.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:28.360
And my mother was there, seeing me onto the train.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:37.360
And it was a whole class which was then moving to England.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:46.360
And I could say at this point that out of the family I'm the only one who remains.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:58.360
Not today, but due to the Holocaust, where the rest of my family were victims of the Holocaust.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.360
I was the only one who left Germany.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:09.360
Renata Collins was assigned to a Kindertransport organised by Nicholas Winton,

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:17.360
a British bank worker whose efforts helped save over 600 children from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:22.360
Renata was ill when the time came for her train to leave Prague.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:28.360
One of my mother's best friends was our doctor, and she was putting her daughter on.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:36.360
Tanya was about 11 years older than me, so I had chickenpox and a temperature of 104.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.360
And my mother really didn't want to put me on the train.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:44.360
And the doctor said, well, if you don't put her on the train, she won't go.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:52.360
Which is quite ironic because the next train of Sir Nicholas's, they were actually on the train and it was stopped.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:57.360
Renata's Kindertransport was the last to get out of Czechoslovakia.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:02.360
She never saw her parents again.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:10.360
Even after leaving the station, while in Germany trains were still subject to searches and seizures by the Nazis.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:17.360
The promised land for those travelling through Germany, at least initially, was the Dutch border.

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:21.360
For Colin Anson, it was a special moment.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:26.360
Our Funtjer station was Emmerich, where everybody was ordered off the train.

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:33.360
And the SS Funtjer police had a last cruel game with us, saying that we wouldn't be allowed to go.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:42.360
Scattering our luggage about and cutting off people's ties in case they had hidden foreign currency in it and that sort of thing.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:47.360
And then with a laugh eventually letting us back onto the train.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.360
And as the train pulled out, we all felt rather washed out.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:18:00.360
And not very long afterwards, the compartment door was flung open and Mr. Blaschke called,

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:04.360
We are of Hollandish and Borden. We are on Dutch soil.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:12.360
And I've never had such a traumatic emotional shock in my life.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:18.360
Not even when my father died because we were under such pressure.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:23.360
One accepted that one expected the worst at all times.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:32.360
And to have lived under such pressure and grown quite accustomed to it for so long,

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:39.360
made one totally unprepared for the sudden explosive release of that pressure at the moment,

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:43.360
when we were told that we were no longer under it.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:48.360
I thought I had faint. It was an amazing moment. I shall never forget it so long as I live.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:54.360
Bea Green remembers the hospitality of the Dutch after crossing the German border.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:19:04.360
When we finally left Germany and chug, chug, chugged into Holland, the train stopped again once we got into Holland.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:11.360
And these wonderful Dutch women came on the train. They were all big and blonde, I think.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.360
At least that's the impression I had.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:20.360
And they were so nice to us. And it was such an extraordinary experience.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:25.360
And they handed out orange juice and white bread and butter.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:31.360
And you know, I don't think anything had tasted so absolutely marvellous

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.360
as that orange juice and that white bread and butter.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:41.360
The final stage of the journey was usually by ship to a coastal town and then a train to London.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:45.360
Des Goulton left mainland Europe at the hook of Holland.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:52.360
We boarded the ship and we went to Harwich.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:20:02.360
And on the ship there were little children, English children, who spoke English perfectly.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:09.360
And I was wondering how it's possible that such little children could speak English so well

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.360
whereas I couldn't speak a word of English.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:20.360
I remember I came to this country with great pleasure and great anticipation.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:29.360
And I was expecting that I would come to this country and it would be nothing but rain all the day.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:33.360
But fortunately the weather was very good.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.360
In Britain, refugees were now safe from the Nazi's clutches,

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:45.360
even if many had been forced to leave their families behind in Europe.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:51.360
In the next episode, we discover how refugees adapted to their new lives in Wales,
