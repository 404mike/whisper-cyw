00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Love is a very splendid thing, It's the April rose that only grows in the early spring.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Love is the wager's way of giving, A reason to be living, That holy crown that brings the man of King.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It burns on a high windmill, With the morning mist to lull this place, Then the world should sing.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:21.000
When your fingers touch my silent heart, Then thought be hard to sing. Yes, true love is a very splendid thing.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Love is the wager's way of giving, A reason to be living, That holy crown that brings the man of King.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:10.000
It burns on a high windmill, With the morning mist to lull this place, Then the world should sing.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:37.000
When your fingers touch my silent heart, Then thought be hard to sing. Yes, true love is a very splendid thing.
