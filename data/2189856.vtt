00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
So my name is Vicki MacDonald and I'm in Holy Trinity Church, Flandernu, at the Longest Yarn.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:14.320
And I have Susan with me who has a memory of her father and her mother during the war.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.320
Susan, can I ask you what memories you have of your father in particular?

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.120
I know that at the time during the war my father was a conscientious objector

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.800
and he was allowed to go to university in Bristol and study to be a Baptist minister.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.120
He was at that time engaged to my mother who was working in Sheffield as an orthoptist

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:43.200
and both of them spent the war fire watching, not every night. They wrote to each other every day

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.400
and unfortunately they got us to burn the letters later. My father then regretted it.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.560
But I did keep all the stamps.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:01.040
Um, late after my father qualified as a minister his first church was High Street Merthyr Tidwell

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.640
and I was born there in 1946 and given the wonderful name of Mivanui which I am incredibly proud of.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.560
That's lovely and did he, did he, I mean fire watching must have been really difficult.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.840
It can't have been an easy job and it was a very, I mean you were watching buildings

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.600
burn and yes and bodies and things. Did it, did it, did he talk about it?

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.080
He never talked about it other than they'd both done it as their war effort.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:42.080
My dad's eldest brother was a trained teacher and his war service as a conscientious objector was to

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.600
be like a hospital porter but I don't know any more than that about where.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.960
It's very interesting isn't it how they were put to war-like activities in a way weren't they?

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.840
Everybody was involved.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.120
Oh thank you Mivanui. Thank you so much. It's really kind of you and I'm delighted to speak to you.
