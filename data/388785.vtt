Mae'n dda, mae'n dda.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.600

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.600
Yn y ffordd yma.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.600
Rwy'n mynd i'n mynd i'n gweithio ar hynny.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.600
Ie, dyna'r hynny.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.600
Alf Poutney.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.600
Alf Poutney.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.600
Yn ogystal â'r hyn, felly roedd gennym ddwy o'r hyn o'r hyn.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.600
Eric Davies, Alf Poutney,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.600
a...

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.600
Gordon Harris.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.600
Gordon Roberts.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.600
Yn ogystal â'r hyn.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.600
Gordon yn dod yn dda unrhyw amser, ond...

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.600
ond...

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.600
ond... nid, dwi ddim yn gallu ei roi.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.600
Alf oedd y bobl iawn.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.600
Alf oedd y bobl iawn, a roedd yn llwybr hyfforddiant.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.600
Roedd yn cael ei ddwylo.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.600
Yn ogystal â'i ddwylo, nid oedd yn dda oedd y ffyrdd.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.600
Roedd yn dda.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.600
Gallai.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.600
Nid, ond polio.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.600
Ac roedd wedi effeithio fel d racion polio o gymlrwuri.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.600
Roedd wedi effeithio fel y gallai.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.600
When I went to knock while his eyes were gone.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.600
Yndi nonogol i'r bobl iawn o'r Neil Gaugher?

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.600

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.600
He didD, didn't he?

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.600
He get poor eyesight.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.600
ac ar li y altous.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.600
He could ride.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.600
If he had turned vertically there woulda got dogs.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.600
Mae Washington North climbing up the sports shop in Shoesmeaier total nude.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.600
Os bais o fe.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.600
Ac roedd Toy Pe Pingson fe route these bats mate specially for.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.600
Roedd wedi sev addi Blake dough really well.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600
Mae'r bŵer yn dda.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.600
Beth o'r bwysau o'r bach a'r pethau y byddwch chi'n ei fwynhau?

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.600
Roedd yn dda yn dda, ac rwy'n credu bod y pethau y byddwch chi'n ei dda heddiw.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.600
Dwi ddim yn gallu ei ddod.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:09.600
Roedd o'r bwysau o'r helmets, dydyn ni ddim wedi'i gynhyrchu'r byd.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.600
Yn olaf, gallai eich bod yn dda, ond byddwch chi'n mynd i'r ddwy o'r ddwy o'r gweithiau.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.600
Padd was o ran y shackle.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.600
Nid yw'r pethau'n dda'r gwaith iawn.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.600
A'r bach, mae'n cysylltu o'ch gael y bach yma heddiw.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.600
Nid yw'r bach yn dda heddiw.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.600
Ond yn olaf, o ran y bach o'r gweithiau.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.600
Yn olaf, o ran y bach o'r gweithiau.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.600
Roeddwn yn dda yn dda.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.600
Roeddwn yn dda.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.600
Yn olaf, o ran y bach o'r gweithiau.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.600
Dwi ddim yn gwybod yn y byd.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.600
Who had that? Jonesy?

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.600
Keep it, take it with you, I'll do without.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.600
Too smelly!

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.600
Do you remember people getting hurt?

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.600
Yep, well, there's that famous one.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.600
Oh yeah!

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.600
Though they did, but the most famous was Grintana and the Vicar of Condor.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.600
Do you remember?

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.600
No, I don't remember.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.600
Well, Grintana, he hadn't got a box on the Vicar.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.600
Condor used to play and he'd get him midships.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.600
And because Glenn always exaggerated, he said they swelled up so much,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.600
you had to take him up and put him on a wheelbarrow.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.600
But that was...

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.600
Glenn was forever telling Jonesy.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.600
That was a Grintana, but apparently he was very ill for weeks.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.600
Glenn lived on that story for donkeys.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.600
Quite a long time, yeah.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.600
Donkeys years.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.600
As a quick baller, I would pride myself I hit someone.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.600
Especially in the ribs.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.600
You've got the Colin Davis attitude.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.600
That's one I'm there to be hated.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.600
You were the same vintage as Lillian Thompson.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.600
That's right. That's what I enjoyed, was Lillian.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.600
Especially Thompson as well.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.600
Yeah, well, you couldn't get more aggressive than those two, could you?

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.600
No.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.600
Some of the matches, though, that we did play in, Newtown, Llandud, Lewis,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.600
I know that they were particularly venomous on occasions.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.600
Yeah, Llandud, Lewis played hard, didn't they?

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.600
Especially Meredeth.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.600
Yeah, the wicket keeper.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.600
And of course, Chinke from Newtown, Keith Harding.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.600
Horrible little man.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.600
He was always...

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.600
You two were always going at one another.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.600
Always.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.600
You'd see someone back.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.600
Well, I didn't, yeah.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.600
And you wouldn't let him lay.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.600
No, he was a good spinballer.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.600
Very good spinballer.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.600
Oh, the one year, the first year that Montgomery won, Lee, I think.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.600
We had to beat Newtown up there, and we had to get a draw with them,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.600
and beat Chelmarsh, I think, in the final game.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.600
And Montgomery were reduced to about...

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.600
Oh, Newtown batted very well, they made 180 or something.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.600
Montgomery were about 60 for five.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.600
Kinsey was still in.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.600
Gareth Jones came in, and they played a bit,

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.600
and Kinsey decided, he said to Gareth,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.600
You play Harding, I will play Alan Williamson, Brian Jones.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.600
And that's what they did, they stayed.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.600
And Gareth was one of the few who could play Harding.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.600
Well, he spun the ball, John could play it, because he used to go out to it.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.600
No, Gareth could play him, because Gareth could play him on the leg side.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.600
Kinsey used to go out to a 6'3 or 7'2 field.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.600
Well, he used to get me out regularly, Harding.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.600
I couldn't find him at all.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.600
In the end, I decided, because I wasn't fleet footed,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.600
I used to go right back on the stumps and watch the ball,

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.600
and he couldn't get me out then, but when I used to play forward,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.600
I'd add it straight away by going right back on the stumps and watching the ball come on.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.600
Nice little man.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.600
There were a lot of incidents with Newtown, especially during and after.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.600
It got worse after I was there about a year ago.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.600
League cricket.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.600
You had to have a new ball.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.600
The Nigel Owen was working for the Post Office at the time,

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.600
and he didn't finish in time, and they would hold the game up.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.600
Oh, Nigel hadn't come, so Harding had forgotten the ball,

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.600
he'd have to go home for the ball.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.600
He'd bring Nigel, how long are you going to be?

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.600
And he'd come back, there wasn't a new ball.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.600
There was something else.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.600
Oh, that was another employer of theirs.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.600
Rob, our captain of the town, go out and toss a coin.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.600
Oh, the captain hasn't come.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.600
Go out and toss a coin with somebody, and oh, win the toss.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.600
And then the captain would show up.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.600
Oh no, didn't authorise him to toss.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.600
We'd have to toss the coin again.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.600
That wasn't Newtown.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.600
That would have happened once, but we didn't agree to it, did we?

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.600
It used to be the most bad.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.600
It happened more than once.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.600
It happened once, I can remember it happening once,

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.600
and we refused to toss again.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.600
This is after my time.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.600
This was an iterated bad, even, Newtown, there.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.600
Well, I couldn't accept that we had come up and were as good as they were.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.600
They were always the top dogs in MacGonish, weren't they, Newtown?

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.600
Oh, yeah.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.600
Always.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.600
They did have good players, didn't they?

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.600
All their players.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.600
In our time.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.600
Edgar Williams was a very good captain and player.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.600
Because Edward was a captain.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.600
He counted, didn't he?

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.600
Oh, yeah.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.600
He followed John Bennett as captain, I think, didn't he?

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.600
Edgar was a fierce competitor, but he was one of these little tricks about Edgar.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.600
He played it hard and he played it fair.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.600
Yeah, same with football, I believe.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.600
Terrific.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:23.600
Do you think that, I mean, you sort of mentioned sort of chatter and things during the play.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.600
Did that change, do you think, in the time that you were all playing?

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.600
Did it get worse?

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.600
It got worse.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.600
Well, they say I chatted a lot.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.600
I didn't think I chatted a lot.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.600
It did.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.600
Oh, it did.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.600
Well, I didn't mind that.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.600
I enjoyed that.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.600
I thought it was good.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:47.600
Because it can work psychologically to your own advantage, somebody going on.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:55.600
I would hate it coming into the wicket batting in Newtown players.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:02.600
Because the innuendos that you get, you knew what they were trying to do.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.600
And it was very, very intimidating, especially for one so young.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.600
Nigel Owen particularly was a good daft hand at sledging.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.600
Sledging wasn't as widespread as today, probably, but he used to sledge, didn't he?

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.600
Oh, yes.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.600
He's got eyes up the head.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.600
Yes.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.600
I think one or two others, Keith Harding did as well.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.600
Oh, he was always, he was one of the main protagonists.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.600
And the wicket keeper, what's his name?

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.600
He kicked the stump.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.600
Fred Taylor.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.600
Fred who kicked the stump.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.600
He kicked the stump so?

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.600
With his toe.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.600
Yeah.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.600
Because he did come and play for Montgomery.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.600
He played for Montgomery, right.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.600
He went on that tour.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.600
Because he always used to tell me how he used to do it, like, with the stump.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.600
Oh, yeah.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.600
Very competitive.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.600
Very competitive.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.600
I think there were bowlers just as quick then as there are today, but maybe not as many

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.600
as there are these days, perhaps.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.600
I don't know.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:54.600
The only quick ones I can remember is Nigel and Richardson Church.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.600
He was quick.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.600
Oh, he was quick, yeah.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.600
No, not what, oh, of course, Noel Jones.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.600
He gave the impression of being quick because he was a big bloke, like, wasn't he?

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.600
Yeah.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.600
Because he always used to smoke a pipe as well, didn't he?

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.600
The Evercross was quick at Welshpool.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:13.600
Not as quick as Ken Lewis, but Ken Lewis must have been the quickest.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.600
Probably quicker than Nigel, wasn't he?

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.600
Probably.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.600
Nigel got a big advantage of height.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.600
He would always bowl.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.600
The bloody thing was up under your height.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.600
Ken Lewis beat the bowl more.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.600
Yeah, Ken Lewis was a skiddy sort of bowler.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.600
Yeah, and he moved it back.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.600
Like, for a fast bowler, what was Ken?

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.600
Five foot eight or nine?

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.600
He wasn't much taller, was he?

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.600
Yeah, he wasn't much taller.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.600
Nigel was Llyrwood more than that.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.600
So it's, as you say, Malcolm Marshall later times.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:47.600
They always said Malcolm Marshall's bounce was the most hard to deal with because it was lower trajectory than the big six foot six like Garner and Mosh and Ambrose.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.600
So, yeah.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.600
But the big difference, the wickets must be a lot better now.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.600
Well, they are.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.600
Much.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.600
Certainly local cricket anyway.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.600
Some of the wickets we played on were diabolical, weren't they?

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.600
Oh, come on.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.600
Not just here, but in Landbathlin.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.600
Well, Landbathlin is still the same now as it was then.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.600
Really?

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.600
We don't play over there.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.600
Caersers?

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.600
I don't remember.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.600
De Funct.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.600
De Funct.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.600
Is it?

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.600
We had a few run-ins with Fordham.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.600
Oh yeah.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.600
Yeah.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:24.600
Because I was reading some of the old reports that one match was abandoned and your name was mentioned.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.600
Never.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.600
Who was the main one?

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.600
Stafford.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.600
He was.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.600
Paul Stafford.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.600
Oh, he was a nasty.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.600
Beauty Stafford and Paul Stafford.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.600
You've got a good memory.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.600
He was a nasty bit of goods.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.600
Paul Stafford.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.600
Paul Stafford was a good cricket to Herbie.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.600
But he was a nasty piece of goods.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.600
Paul Stafford could be.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:48.600
I remember Herbie had two little boys, Lance and George, you might know them.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.600
They were about Lance Stafford.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.600
They used to have sheep running round on the field then.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:05.600
I can see Herbie running off in the middle of an over to sort these boys out and say, slapping Lance around the yard and saying, God say that, those are not currents.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.600
And he was stuffing his bum in.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.600
Chomping.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.600
Chomping.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.600
Chomping spotlings.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:17.600
Yeah, there was the elf feeling there sometimes.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.600
Now we're out sort of the other way around.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.600
Games where you played, you know, where there was respect between the two sides.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.600
It was a good game to play.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.600
Did you remember Goods Side?

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.600
Yeah, Hardcourt was one, wasn't it?

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.600
Hardcourt was a nice match.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.600
Played in a good spirit.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.600
Wiggins.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.600
Church Stratford.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.600
Oh, Wiggins too.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.600
Yeah, Henry Wiggins.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.600
That was a great fixture.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.600
They had a very good bowling bowler.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.600
Ball right through always.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.600
Guy Mortis was another one.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.600
Yeah, Guy Mortis.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.600
You see, you tend to forget the nice things.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.600
You remember the incidents, don't you?

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.600
In life, not just in cricket.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.600
Do you remember, I can only remember once, somebody turning up drunk to play for Montgomery Cricket Club.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.600
I don't know whether you remember that.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.600
No, I don't remember that.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.600
Wasn't Robinson?

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.600
Tim Robinson.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.600
Gerald Robinson.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.600
Did he, gentlemen?

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:11.600
We went up to Lannadus to play and he was drunk as anybody could be.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.600
He was staggering about.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.600
He kicked the wicket.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.600
He was f***ing and blinding.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.600
And it's the only time I've seen a cricketer sent off the field.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.600
Harry sent him off.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.600
Harry sent him, go.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.600
He sent him off.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.600
Oh, it's terrible.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.600
I don't think we went down very well as Lannadus.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.600
So what were the circumstances behind that?

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.600
He had a lift with someone.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.600
He used to go in the pub, didn't he, before the matches, Tim?

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.600
He used to go in the checkers before we went.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.600
He used to be there two hours drinking.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.600
He could be a good batsman.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.600
He was a good sportsman.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.600
So I remember Tim and John, they were playing in the same club.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:47.600
I remember Tim and John knocking up 120 to win without a wicket going down against Cork over.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.600
Yeah, he should have put on over 100 once.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.600
I remember that, yeah.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.600
Once.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.600
He could be a good wicketkeeper when he was sober.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.600
I shouldn't be saying these things about people, probably.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:03.600
Talking about wicketkeepers, in my time we've had two outstanding wicketkeepers.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.600
Ed Williams, square man, came.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.600
Lanny Boy worked in Kent and played fairly high class league cricket in Kent.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.600
Came back, couldn't get him now.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.600
Well, he lived in Guildfield, but he wanted to play for Lannadus.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.600
Lyn Meredith was Lannadus wicketkeeper, he was a county wicketkeeper.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.600
So Ed came here and he made a big difference.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.600
Well, he made a big difference to me because I became friendly with him.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:34.600
He coached my boys and Andrew in high school.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:43.600
Later we had Phil Stevenson came who had played, who was a very, he was a spiky character.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:51.600
Whereas a lot of us didn't confront unless somebody confronted us, Stevenson went out to confront people.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.600
He would start it.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:01.600
I was always within the rules, but I was not comfortable with umpiring when Stevenson was playing, quite honestly.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:09.600
Did you ever, when you were an umpire, were you ever mindful of what was going on and have to speak?

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.600
I spoke to one, I used to speak to Stevenson quite often.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.600
Look, talking about wicketkeepers, going back to the 50s, Gordon Evans was a good wicketkeeper.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.600
He was a decent wicketkeeper.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.600
Sound rather than brilliant.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.600
But then, you know, wicketkeepers like I remember, wicketkeepers in those days, especially in Montgomery, fast forward bowling,

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.600
you stopped a lot with your pads because they did come straight along the ground.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.600
Yeah, or jumped up at you.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.600
We didn't have thigh pads though in those days.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.600
No, no.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:42.600
It wasn't no. Helmets would come in and it was a different ball game, wasn't it, altogether?

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.600
It was.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.600
It was all right for somebody like John, he was fast on his feet.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.600
And get up or get hit, did you?

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.600
The rest of us were a bit slower on our feet used to get hit.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.600
You weren't slow, Brian. You make out, you were.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:59.600
Old man in your 20s you made out.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.600
It's a laden footed compared with you now.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.600
No, I don't know.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.600
Really?

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.600
You're running yourself down, I think.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.600
No, I was wrong.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.600
Princess of modesty, you think?

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.600
Yes, it is, yes.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.600
I mean, that outfield was so diabolical, wasn't it? You couldn't hit a four, it was hard going.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.600
It must have been.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:23.600
I remember Harry had scored 50 or something and he had blisters all over his hands and some cut in the ball.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.600
Yes.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:32.600
That's because of the job he did. Remember when he said, you walked an inch your nose against Bishop's Castle, was it?

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.600
No, I cut my eye there.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.600
Oh, your eye, was it?

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.600
Yes.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.600
Off the top edge.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.600
Off the top edge of a slow bowler.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:44.600
I did the same at Condover once. I think Noel Jones bowled and I came up, I was straight into the infirmary.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:50.600
I had six stitches across here at Condover. There was blood all over the place.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.600
I don't think I'd played for about a month after.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.600
But apart from that, there was no serious injury.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.600
No, no serious injury.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.600
There was somebody from, got a terrible band down here one day from knocking over.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.600
Do you remember? But there weren't many, were there?

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.600
No.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.600
Very few and far between.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:11.600
I've got one tale that you two will know but Philip knows about.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:19.600
In that we went to, oh, what's that place by Bridge North?

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.600
Rowslake?

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.600
Craven Arms?

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.600
No, no.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.600
Werfield?

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.600
Warfield.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.600
Warfield.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.600
Philip was umpiring.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.600
Oh, yes.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.600
And Jonathan was fielding at Deep Square Lines.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.600
Jonathan Williams.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.600
Jonathan Williams.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.600
Jonathan Williams.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.600
And the ball went out to him and he threw it in.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:42.600
And I was, I think I was watching, I was standing on the boundary by Jonathan when he threw it in.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:47.600
And this ball hit Philip the umpire from the back of my head.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.600
Full tilt.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.600
Full tilt.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.600
And Jonathan never said a word when he threw it.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.600
He didn't shout, look out, or anything like that.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.600
And it laid him.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.600
It laid me out.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.600
Did it?

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.600
It was absolutely amazing.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.600
It really was.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.600
It was such a good aim.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.600
I didn't, you know, I had a lump, but I didn't have a headache.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.600
I did give Jonathan a few choice words.

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:13.600
Was he as, I don't remember him bowling like you, was Jonathan as quick as Chris here when he was a school boy?

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.600
Almost so, when he was at his best.

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.600
And he's the quickest since Chris was out.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:22.600
He hadn't got good, well, control when he was fast.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.600
He learned control later.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.600
He hadn't got the nastiness in him that this man had got.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.600
No.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.600
No, Jonathan was too passive.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.600
And he said he should be more like me.
