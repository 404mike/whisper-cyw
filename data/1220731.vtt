00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480
So you were at school until you were how old? 16. And so we're into the war now. When the

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.360
Second World War started you were what 12? Yeah. Okay. So can you tell me any memories

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.800
of the war? Yes, when the sirens went and we were in school, we had to go down to the

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.440
cellar because that was reinforced. A lot of people had cellars unless they had the

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:33.280
Anderson shelters. We thought it was very, it was great fun at first until we had quite a lot of

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:40.720
these raids. So then we had to take our school books down to the cellars with us and lessons

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.240
were continued down there. And you had to wait for the all clear. Do you know the sound of the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:55.680
sirens? Yeah. Yeah. So you had one when you had to take cover and one when it was all clear. Yes.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:04.840
When the sirens first started they were... But the all clear was just one long note.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.920
Okay. Yeah. So you knew which was which if you fell asleep.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.880
Yes. To denote. Yes.
