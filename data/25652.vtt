00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.500
Track 1, Winford Vaughan Thomas Memorial, The Best View in Wales

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.800
If you are lucky enough to have good weather, and you agree that this is a pretty fantastic

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.120
view then you are in good company, as the man who is depicted on the engraved slate

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.760
panel in front of you described it as the best view in Wales.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.760
So who was he?

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.560
During his life Winford Vaughan Thomas brought pleasure to millions of people.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.480
He will be most fondly remembered for his work at the BBC.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.040
As a war correspondent between 1942 and 1945 he dealt with some of the most frightening

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.320
and thrilling events of the Second World War, including a report from a Lancaster bomber

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.580
over Berlin and another from the Belsen concentration camp.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:58.820
In 1953 he was also part of a team to commentate on the coronation of the Queen.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.740
Later in his life he not only co-founded Harlech TV, now ITV Wales, but he also travelled the

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.860
length and breadth of Wales to fulfil his love of the Welsh countryside.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.700
So this man knows a good view when he sees one.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.620
13 peaks are shown on the slate panel and on a good day you may even be able to make

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.620
out Snowdon.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.220
Winford Vaughan Thomas would have enjoyed the 9km walk we are about to embark on, but

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.700
would have been only too aware of the need to take care when walking in the uplands.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.660
Whilst much of the route is along well defined tracks, some of your journey will take you

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.300
over rough and sometimes steep moorland.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.140
If you are at all concerned that visibility will be reduced due to low cloud or mist,

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.500
then please consider delaying your trip.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.820
Also ensure that you are wearing sturdy walking boots and carry suitable weather protection

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.940
for all conditions.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.440
The weather can quickly change in the Welsh hills.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.060
Navigation aids in the form of a route finding map and compass, plus the ability to use them,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.500
will also be wise additions to the packed lunch and a drink as the audio trail will

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.300
take at least three hours to complete.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.340
So if you have decided to follow our audio trail, you will hear how life has changed

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.980
on these moors over the millennia, and what exciting yet subtle plans the Montgomeryshire

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.820
Wildlife Trust have for their future.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.980
If you would like to discover more about Winford Vaughan Thomas, including some of his most

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.320
memorable recordings, you can download a podcast about his life from the Campaign for the Protection

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:54.120
of Rural Wales website www.cprw.org.uk.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.220
Head down the track past the memorial and through two gates, keeping the conifer plantation

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.840
on your right.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.920
Where the track crosses a little gully, on a right hand bend, head diagonally uphill

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.760
across the open moorland, keeping a fence line in view on your left.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.680
On reaching the top of the ridge, bear right towards a new stile.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.200
Climb this and follow the narrow path through the heather and bilberry to the top of the

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.180
ridge where there is a concrete trig point.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.120
Listen to track two at the concrete trig point that offers extensive views.
