00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
I just quickly run through how we started the centre, why the centre was started.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.200
I suppose briefly, what was it before?

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.360
So I used to do a lot of wildlife stuff anyway,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.680
but at the same time I was doing angling trips, which I hated doing.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.400
Didn't enjoy that at all, I was never an angler.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.960
I liked catching a bit of bass and stuff, a bit of macro for the plate,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:34.800
but not into spending days pulling up fish by their lip to chuck them back in.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.200
Happy to catch fish for the plate, but anything beyond that, I'm not really interested in.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.800
So yeah, I used to go take people over to Ireland,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.680
I used to do lots of wildlife stuff as well,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.000
and then just quickly we had, with the angling I'd taken it as far as I could,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.840
so we were doing offshore wreck fishing.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.560
So we developed it from doing the sort of short, the bucket and spade short trips,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.600
two or four hours, you know doing eight hour trips, and then we did the wreck fishing,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.760
going out to these families' wrecks about halfway to Ireland, about 30 odd miles offshore,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.200
deep water wrecks. This was like what everybody wanted to do on the south coast, that's where

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.080
the, you know, a lot of the boats were doing offshore wreck fishing trips, and we'd found these

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.840
wrecks, big fish, pollock, 18.5, pollock, massive fish, and that's what the anglers all wanted.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.760
And then what they used to do down there, down on the south coast, I can't remember which islands

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:50.400
they used to go to, you know there's the Sillies and all the sort of Channel Islands, so what I decided

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.280
to do was do an Irish trip, so you go halfway to Ireland, you fish the wrecks, and then you go

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.320
into southern Ireland, we'd spend a Wexford, we'd spend a day fishing around Wexford,

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.640
Tuscarock and all that, then back into Wexford, and a three day trip, so you know one day over

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.760
to Ireland, fishing the wrecks, one day fishing around Ireland, around Wexford, Tuscarock,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.320
and then the other day coming back, fishing the wrecks on the way back.
