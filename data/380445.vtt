00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
So when operations were wound down at this loss, what happened to the camera after that?

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.600
And what happened to you? Where did you move on to?

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.480
Oh we went back cargo carrying.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.480
Just general cargo carrying duties?

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:22.000
We left, we left, we left Aberdovey on November the 5th 1945.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:32.720
So we went up to South Bank in London and I think I left it about the beginning, about the 5th of December.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.120
And I went home to Margate in Kent for a while.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:50.320
Then I came back to Balfour in Christmas 1945 because I was, well it became my wife, I was gone with her.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:01:01.280
So I came back to Balfour Christmas 1944 and 1945.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.240
And then I stayed with my future mother-in-law in the Grand Hotel because she owned the Grand Hotel.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:30.000
And then about May 1940 I suppose it was, I had a letter from the captain of the camera saying come up to, where the bloody hell was it?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.680
Up North somewhere, can't remember now.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.120
It would be to your advantage Middlesbrough, up to Middlesbrough.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.120
And when I got, what, what, re-signed this and, oh Christ I don't know, I got about a thousand bloody quid.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.120
I said what's this all about? He said although you haven't been here you're still on pay.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.320
So he said now will you come back cooking for us? Oh I couldn't refuse.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:09.520
So I went back to see the cargo carrying, and they were carrying mostly coal then, till August Bank holiday 1946.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:20.080
When we were coming down from Blyth with a load of coal to London, the base, and I said oh okay captain I've stopped, stopped with you for three or four months.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.160
And I was now going to give up the sea, so I gave up the sea and came to the Grand Hotel both.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:38.640
And there I was until, what was it, 1978 or something.
