00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well thank you Marion for doing this interview.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So I'd just like to ask some questions about your life, especially about Caldecott, but I'll start first of all with where were you born?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I was born in Tiverton in Devon in 1938.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And what were your first memories?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I think my first memories of back in those days was having to draw the curtains to keep the light in.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I don't know why, because at that time Tiverton really wasn't under threat, even though we were 15 miles from Exeter.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We never had air raid shelters and I really can't remember anything really happening during the war.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I must have been lived in the land of... what? Ignorance? Bliss? I don't know.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
But that's all I can remember and having a gas mask to go to school.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And what about the house that you lived in? What sort of house was it?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It was a three bedroom, what would be termed as a terrace, kind of house, which backed onto fields and had a little stream at the bottom of the garden, which invariably you fell in.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Ideal really, idealic, out in the countryside on the outskirts of Tiverton.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And were you an only child?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
No, I'm from a large family.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It was idealic though, even though we were a large family.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And how many were you?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I'm one of 14.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
It must have been hard work for your mother.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:10.000
It was hard work for my mother and my father went to work every day of his life, every day.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And what work was that?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:25.000
He worked at the quarry at Cove near Bempton, which in those days he didn't go to war because of... I forget what they call it.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It was something like a protected occupation?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Yes, a reserved occupation.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
A reserved occupation, so he was in the Home Guard.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And I can remember him telling many a tale about the Home Guard.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And one particular time was they had to share a gun.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Which seems crazy today, but they had to share this one gun and they had a whale of a time up in the hills with the Home Guard.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And it stayed with me to this day.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And so you were in Tiverton, in the town of Tiverton?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Yes.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Yes.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
So what was Tiverton like?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I would say it was quite like Chepstow is at the moment.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
A lovely little town.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
It had about four churches, town hall, typical little country town.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And split into two.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
If you lived up over the hill or you lived beneath the hill.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And it was quite separated like that.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
But it was a nice little town.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And which were you, over the hill?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Under the hill.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
But it was very nice.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000
We had parks down there, schools, churches, shops, fine.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And what brought you from Tiverton to Caldecott? And when was that?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
1967.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
We both worked at that time in the local factory.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:19.000
But by coming to Lanwin Steelworks, my husband could double his pay for moving 100 odd miles.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So to make a better life, we had two boys at that time.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
We came to Caldecott.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
My husband to work in the steelworks as an engineer.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And we bought our first house in Shelley Close.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And that was another big adventure.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So that was a big, I know it wasn't that far, 100 odd miles.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
But it's still a big step to move away.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.000
It was a really big step because not many people had cars in those days.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And we had to buy a car and a house and keep two little boys.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So it was a big, big move for us at that time.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And with no relatives in the area?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Yes, I had a sister who'd also moved over here about two years before.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
So that gave us that little incentive to come, I must say.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So tell us about the house that you moved into.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000
It was a brand new house in Shelley Close, which we bought for Â£3,000,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
which seemed an awful lot of money.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000
But it was an end of terrace, lovely little house, really.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
But then the following year my daughter came along.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
So that made three children.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
She was my Welsh gift, I think.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Yes, we lived there until 1997.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And then we moved to Ebbw Road in Caldecott.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
At that time, Ebbw Road was on the outskirts of Caldecott.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Well, no houses behind us in Wentwood View or down below in Elam Way.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
It was an ideal place to be with the children.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
They could run in the fields, go, well, just run.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And today, I'm afraid to say, it's all built up around us.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
But that's progress, they say.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
So you missed the open countryside?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Because my husband also was born in the countryside, and he loved the fields.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000
He had a cottage in an idyllic little village called Hemiark.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And he just loved the fields.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
So that's progress, or is it?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I don't know.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
So tell us about that house, what sort of house it was.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:21.000
It's a four-bed detached on Ebbw Road.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Sort of house I always look at and think this is a house I would have drawn as a child.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Two windows up, one down, and a door.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And it just reminds me of a house, but I fell in love with it as soon as I saw it.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000
We moved there, as I say, in about 1997, and we've been there ever since.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And what sort of facilities has the house got, perhaps by comparing it with your childhood?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Well, I think I was quite lucky in Tiverton because we always had an indoor bathroom and toilet.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Always.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:08.000
In comparison to my husband, where he had to walk 100 yards down the garden to the toilet, I was a spoilt town girl.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
We had running water, we had it all.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:25.000
So really, my childhood wasn't, I can't say, because I loved to go to my auntie who had an outside toilet with a lovely wooden seat.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And we loved to go up that garden because it was so different.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And in the new house, obviously you had all of those facilities.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Oh yes.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Anything more than you had when you were...

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Well, just a downstairs cloakroom really, which was a bonus with the children not having to run up the stairs.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
A nice big garden, which we didn't have in Shelley Close.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And obviously we still have a nice garden, big garden at the back.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:04.000
And cooking, kitchen and heating and so on, what sort of facilities have you got?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000
We've got all facilities, gas, electric, central heating, it's all there.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
We had that in Shelley Close actually, so we've been quite lucky.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:28.000
So when the children were young, and you were a young mother, so what were your social outlets?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Well, when they were really young, it was really just going out to the rugby club, being part of the landworn social.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000
But really not much social life, a couple of times a year.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:10:04.000
We formed a little children's play group back in those days that we had in St Mary's School in the old hall there.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And our children used to go there.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And at what age were they at that time?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Well, Claire would have been about three, and the boys would have been in West End School by then.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And then they moved on to St Mary's School and then on to the college.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And as with the play group, the organisers were volunteers?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Oh yes, yes. Everybody gave a hand, everybody, all the mothers.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.000
I think we used to pay something like 50p to cover the cost of the hall, and that was it at those days.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:59.000
But I think at that time it must have been one of the first play groups to be established in Cardacot.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And you were a young mother.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
So how did you get to know people in the area?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Through the rugby club and through the play group. And that really was my only avenue to go.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And as the children grew older and went to school, did that change?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Not really. Our life has been wound around the rugby club, I've got to say, over the years.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Because my maxim was, well, you're going to play rugby, I'm not staying home.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
So we all went to rugby. We all went as a family.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
You know, all with a kit on, off we went.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:00.000
So it was all encompassing. It was daytime activities to watch rugby and presumably a social activity.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Oh yes, yes. Obviously the more you meet parents outside of schools, you meet.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And that circle increases all the time. They were good days.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And which schools did the children go to?

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:29.000
They all started off in West End and then to St Mary's in Church Road and then to the Comp.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And stayed in Cardacot schools all the way through?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Yes, yes.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:47.000
So turning to the Cardacot town or village as it was, can you describe how it was, how you remember it when you first came?

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Yeah, it was rather ramshackled as I remember.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
The better side of the street was where Grimmers the Electric shop used to be.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:05.000
But Washburns had a garage and things on the pavement and you could buy most things.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Shop across the road. The mace shop, as I remember.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
There's a grocery down the bottom and you could buy furniture upstairs.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Adam's shop round the corner was like Aladdin's cave.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
You wanted it, you could get it in Adam's shop. So that was fine.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
So did you have to go outside of Cardacot to shop in those days?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Not really. No, you could get your groceries, you could get clothes.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:42.000
As far as I'm aware, very rarely did we have to travel to Newport. Very rarely.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:50.000
And did you find that while shopping in Cardacot you would meet people you knew?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Oh yes. The village, like walking through the village, it's like walking through friends.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Everyone speaks to you and that's how you get to know.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Through your children mostly, in schools and what they do, whatever activities they did as children, you joined in.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And how have you seen it change over those years? Quite a few years of course.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Well it has changed. I mean it was rebuilt, if you like, way back.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Not necessarily for the better because a lot of the small shops went.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Because people then became more travelled, they all got cars and went to Newport.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:51.000
So really the big supermarkets killed the village. That little closeness that you could go down.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Living in West End mostly, the Co-op has been there forever. Clarks of Bookchis was there.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:09.000
You really didn't need to go any further. But if you wanted other things you came up into the village.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:19.000
And you knew you would get it somewhere. Little dress shops were there. And it was all there.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And the children's shopping, clothes, that sort of thing?

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Well I'm sure I must have bought it. Because I couldn't drive at that time.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And my husband would have taken the car to work. So I must have bought their clothes.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Because there was no computer, no shopping by computer or whatever you call it. Online. None of that.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000
So I must have got their clothes in the village. Adams's I think. Was the shop?

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Marjory's.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Marjory's, yeah.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
So school uniforms?

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Adams's, you got that. Or either in the school at that time.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.000
I don't think they were as particular about school uniform back then as they are today.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
And I think school uniform is good.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:24.000
So you said in the school, I mean I guess, the comprehensive school. So they supplied uniforms?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Yes, you could buy it all in the school.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
So was it a shop?

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000
I suppose it must have been. Must have been.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Or Adams's sold what you required. Used to buy things like rugby shirts, ties.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:54.000
I'm sure I must have bought blazers in Adams's. Must have. Shirts.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:05.000
So when the children were growing up and became teenagers, so what was their, how did they exercise their social life?

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000
What were the places they went to and enjoy?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
There wasn't much, was there, really. There wasn't anywhere for them to go.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
When the leisure centre opened up, then yes they could go there.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
But really there was nowhere for the children to go. Nowhere.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:34.000
And you just had to trust that if they went out they wouldn't get into any mischief.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Obviously like my daughter went to girl guides and things, well that was like a little bit social for her.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000
But looking back there was nowhere for my sons to go except rugby training.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:57.000
So it was very poor for social.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Because they're looking to do more social things these days.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Whereas in my day you'd sit on the pavement and you'd all sit around under the lamp and you'd talk.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Until that lamp went out and indoors you had to go.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:22.000
So although things have changed today, and I think children today are so lucky because they can do anything they want.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Anything. And it's there for them. Just grab it.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
What about the school? Were there any social activities associated with the school?

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Any clubs? Any dances? Anything like that?

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Not a lot. Probably the school had the disco. But no, not a lot.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
That wasn't a frequent...

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Not at all, no.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:04.000
So how did they meet when the time came, boyfriends and girlfriends, how did they meet?

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Do you know, I have no idea. I suppose in the village they would... school maybe?

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
I really don't know how they would meet each other.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:26.000
The only place they could go would be to a local pub at that time. I really don't know.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Would they have gone outside of Caldecott when they were teenagers?

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:41.000
No, because there was no transport, no buses. No. They wouldn't have even gone to Chepster. So it was all local.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:54.000
So bringing us more up to date, so how do you think it's changed since those years when the children were younger to now?

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Well it's not changed a lot because the leisure centre, fine, but you can't get into the leisure centre unless you've booked something months in advance.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:21.000
There is a youth club, I don't know how successful that is, and that's it as far as I see. I see children still hanging around the library.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Has that got any better? I don't think so. But what do children want? What do they want? Be entertained all the time? I don't know.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:46.000
And again bringing us up to date as far as what is now a town, of course. So how has that changed?

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
In the shopping area, how would you see the changes that have taken place there?

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Well, if you like charity shops, hairdressers, you've got plenty of that. Betting shops, yes.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
No, it's not changed for the better. I'm quite sure of that.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:22.000
And it's a vicious circle because people shop online. The big stores have taken the heart of the village away as it has most places.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:32.000
So you don't really want to go to the village. The bank is gone. It's just fading away slowly.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
And why do you think that has happened?

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Well, I think people have become more mobile, more cars, or you can get to Newport easily, spitty, everything you could want.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:55.000
And online shopping again. You just pick up your device and off you go. Easy.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
And how do you see the future? How do you think it's going to develop in the future?

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Well, unless they make room for more specialist little shops in Cardacombe. It makes it viable for them to come here. I can't see it.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000
And what sort of things, changes would be needed to make it more viable?

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:31.000
That's a million dollar question, isn't it? What do you want? What do you want? Progress? Is this progress? I don't think so. I don't think so.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:44.000
So turning to your own social life now at this stage, what are your social outlets? And how do you meet your friends now?

00:22:44.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Well, the U3A. I have so many friends in the U3A, through the walking group, the history, all groups. I think after being a member for so long, I think most people know me.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:18.000
So it's good. And in fact, my sister was over the other day and went to the village and her comment was, people speak to you. And she found that really refreshing.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
So you mentioned the walking group. Are there other groups that you?

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:34.000
I like the history. I like to go to history and gardening. And that's all time allows me to do at the moment.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:44.000
So tell me about the history society. What sort of things does it provide for you?

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Well, it provides me with a lot of knowledge, to get a lot of knowledge about Welsh history. As an English person, I know very little.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:06.000
So by going to the history, I can find out a lot more about Welsh history. And that's quite fascinating to me.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:21.000
I've just always liked history, whether it's English or Welsh actually. And just that. I'm fascinated by what's gone on in the past.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Satisfies your curiosity.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
I must be a very curious person, I think. Yes.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
And the gardening club, what does that offer?

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:41.000
That offers you, not gardening with tools, but actually seeing houses, wonderful gardens, gardens you can visit.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:54.000
And it gives you some ideas. And you have demonstrations of how to cultivate your garden. So it brings a lightness into your life.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000
And where do these events take place?

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Well, various club huts, halls, the history in the luncheon centre, the gardening in the cub hut, walking. Of course you're out in the countryside, wonderful.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
And the gardens that you visit, where have you been?

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Oh, goodness me, there are too many to number.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
What are two examples you can think of?

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Dufferin Gardens down in Cardiff. We've just been to Southport Flower Show.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Margam Abbey, we've been walking in the gardens there, that's very nice these days.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Actually at this moment of time there's too many for me to remember.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Heavyslick?

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Sorry?

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Heavyslick we've been to.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Yes, so many.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
And how is that organised?

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Yes, that's organised by the conveners of the gardening group. So they are very popular.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
And they provide transport?

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Yes, it's all provided for. Same as the special events, it's organised for you to go. And it's easy for people who maybe don't have that facility to do on their own. It's very popular.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
And have you taken a role yourself in the U3A?

00:26:46.000 --> 00:27:09.000
I have. I've been on the committee, I've been vice chairman, I've been convener of the walking group. And at this moment of time we've just reorganised the history and I'm going to become treasurer of the history.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:25.000
And if you were to make some summary points or to say something about things I haven't asked about, is there anything you'd like to say about your life here in Caldecott?

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:47.000
My life here has been very pleasant. I can't say that I wanted to, or we said I'd go back to Tiverton, but no, I know an awful lot of people here, lots of friends, and we've had a good life.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Well thank you for that interview.
