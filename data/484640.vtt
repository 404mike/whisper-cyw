Cardiff Carnival Anniversary Project.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.680
Interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.240
Interviewee Tracy Harding.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.520
The venue is the Swicker office

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.360
and the date today is Friday the 21st of November 2014.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.040
Tracy, for the record, could you please spell your name?

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.040
I'll give that a go.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.840
T-R-A-C-E-Y

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.040
and surname H-A-R-D-I-N-G.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.400
Thanks for that. And you got it right, you'd be glad to know.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.240
Yeah. Excellent.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.960
What's your first recollection of the Cardiff Mass Carnival

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.800
as it was then?

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.840
I first recall the carnival

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.480
with young people wearing sailor costumes,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.560
but I can't particularly,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.560
I think it was in Queen Street and Cardiff Castle,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.800
but I can't specifically remember that,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.840
but I was working for what was Cardiff City Council then

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.640
and would have been working at the Children's Festival,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.120
which I believe they took part in.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.520
Absolutely. That would be the very, very first one in 1990

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.120
and it was led by an artist from Trinidad called Katherine Chan,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.400
who thought it would be a good idea

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.800
to introduce Wales and Cardiff to carnival

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.080
by recreating our own version

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.000
of a traditional Trinidadian masquerade,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.520
which was based on sailors.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.240
So it was a sailor bar, so you quite like it.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.840
I can remember those costumes distinctly.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.960
What was quite interesting for me is that,

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.440
in fact, we didn't go, the route wasn't Queen Street,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.600
but in fact, it was St. Mary's Street.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.080
At that point, St. Mary's Street wasn't pedestrianized

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.920
and also had a divider down the middle

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.800
and we'd managed to close one side of the road.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.360
So we're parading up one side of the road,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.040
whilst the other side of the road actually had cars in it.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.280
And I just remember thinking, very dangerous.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.560
No, it didn't.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.600
I mean, it meant that half our potential audience

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.240
in that area couldn't see what we were doing

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.120
because there were cars passing in front of them.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.560
But there we are.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.040
Early days, we sort of evolved and developed from there.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.080
So having seen it in its original formation

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.080
when it wasn't intergenerational just for kids,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.280
you then, of course, took the carnival plunge

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.520
and became a participant, am I right?

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.400
I did.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.400
And I think, actually, it was through that children's event

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.080
and I worked with children

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.800
at Time in the Play Service in Cardiff.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.320
I became involved by making gigantes,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.400
which are huge, huge puppets.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.440
I think they were about 20 foot tall.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.440
And I remember one of them was a fish

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.360
and I think the other one was a lion.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.320
And we made them with the children of withies

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.320
that we soaked and then used this very thick cling film

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.560
that had to go and buy specially

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.560
and sort of thick tissue paper as well that we covered.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.840
So it created quite a strong structure.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.400
And then we painted the whole thing.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.840
And paraded through Cardiff.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.400
I think we ended up on the museum steps

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.000
and the children carried these huge, huge puppets

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.360
together with myself and another play worker called Wes

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.800
who came from the Riverside Play Center at the time.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.640
And I think it was the Riverside Play Center

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.800
that we worked with particularly

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.840
and possibly Grangetown as well.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.640
Was Wes also known as West Ham?

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.960
He was, that was West Ham, yeah.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.040
That was West Ham, I mean,

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.880
the man with the loudest voice in Cardiff.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.480
He only had one tone of voice.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.880
Even if he was whispering a secret or,

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.320
he could only bellow,

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.840
which was rather fascinating to me.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.480
Even when a bellow wasn't required, it was very loud.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.080
No, I remember him well and affectionately.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.920
Yeah, so Westy and I took the kids through Cardiff

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.360
and there were these huge, huge puppets.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.520
And nobody died.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.880
No, thankfully.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.280
Not carrying those.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.280
They were quite weighty things.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.880
Can't really remember what happened to them afterwards,

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.080
but they were quite spectacular at the time.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.160
I'm sure everybody applauded.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.000
Yeah.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.440
I've got good memories that I associate with them.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.600
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.600
What happened next in your carnival journey?

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.760
Well, I think,

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.160
I think I then became a terrorist banker from hell

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.200
and worked with Warped and Twisted with Tom and Ali

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.200
and Marega Pulsar, I remember particularly.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.640
And we created these costumes

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.760
that were like big black clown trousers

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.400
and they had a wire right through the waist

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.240
so they stood out from your body

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.360
and they have braces to keep them on you.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.760
And we had white vests and black bowler hats

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.520
with white horns curling out of the bowler hats.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.880
I think our faces were painted

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.680
like skeletons or something like that.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.600
And we were wearing roller skates

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.600
and we made the costumes in Kutais Community Centre.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.800
And then we had to roller skate

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.560
from Kutais Community Centre around the corner

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.640
and over the bridge to head into Cardiff City Centre.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.880
And I can remember coming to the bridge

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.240
and thinking, goodness, how am I gonna skate

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.280
down the other side of this bridge

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.520
without crashing into somebody in front of me?

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.160
So I then quickly realised that actually the way to do it

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.040
was to skate from side to side

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.920
rather than just to go straight down

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.040
and plough through the rest of the carnival.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.840
So that's what I did.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.640
I managed to get to the sort of bottom of that bridge safely.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.400
And then the idea really was to sort of skate around

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.560
and kind of skate up to the crowd

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.120
and almost kind of like terrorise them

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.920
as a terrorist banker.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.560
And kind of just skate around doing that really.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.760
It was great fun.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.720
Thoroughly enjoyed it.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.760
And yeah, I loved roller skating.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.000
So it was brilliant for me

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.520
and I was quite a good roller skater.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.360
So you could do turns and everything.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.800
So yeah, it was good fun actually that one.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.080
I enjoyed that.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.120
It sounds wonderful.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.440
And of course, this is all social comments about,

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.920
well, some of the downsides of banking

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.880
well before they introduced these austere times to us.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.000
So I think you probably foresaw that in some way, didn't you?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.760
I mean, obviously, you know, predictions

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.960
of capitalism gone wrong.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.520
Yeah, definitely, definitely.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.560
I think there was an alternative name for those as well,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.760
which I can't really say for the record

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.120
because it's a bit rude.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.120
I'm not sure we can work it out.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.640
Is it rhyming slang?

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.480
It was.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.960
Yes, I can imagine.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.280
It began with the letter W if you're listening to the future.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.680
You can work that out for yourselves.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.520
Yes.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.800
But yes, it was very much about all that.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.800
So having skated in 1995,

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.960
you took your skates off and became a carnival dancer.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.800
Am I right?

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.680
I did, yes.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.880
And became a leaf, I think.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.040
So from a terrace banker to a leaf is quite extreme.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.480
But yeah, wore a big green pointed leafy hat

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.160
and danced with some of the other professional dancers

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.680
in Cardiff, because that's what I did at the time.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.320
I was a dancer, danced professionally and taught dance.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.320
And I danced with June Campbell, Janet Fieldsend,

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.400
Mareaga, Polzar, Miranda, Fernandez,

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.400
Sally McLennan, Sally Verrell.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.480
There were a few of us that were sort of in a group

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.800
and we all sort of danced together

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.000
and choreographed this particular dance

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.280
that we then as part of the carnival,

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.960
danced and paraded through.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.560
Would you have been parading to the music

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.360
of one of the samba bands powering you along the streets?

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.840
I think it was.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.600
I'm not quite sure which samba band it was.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.600
I don't know if it was Cardiff Samba or Adrian Samba Band.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.880
I can't remember the name of it.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.480
No, they were basically Brecon.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.320
They used to come down.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.120
Oh, maybe Brecon, yeah.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.600
So yeah, there were a few samba bands,

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.200
but yeah, we definitely would have done it.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.040
Got it.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.800
Would your group have performed on the finale

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.640
on the steps of the National Museum as well?

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.080
We did.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.320
I don't know if it was,

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.640
was there a stage there at that time?

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.360
Well, the steps themselves actually formed a stage,

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.040
but for that year,

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.120
we actually even brought a flatbed truck in front of it.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:14.960
That's right.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.680
To give another, to add an addition.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.000
Yeah, we danced on the flatbed truck.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.840
Fantastic.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.240
I can remember doing that.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.280
Lovely, and I don't believe anything fell off, did they?

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.160
Which is- No, no.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.440
Yeah, I remember there was some kind of staging

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.280
and yeah, it was the flatbed truck.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.280
It was the flatbed truck.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.240
It was all we could think of.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.720
How can we, it's a functioning museum until five o'clock.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.240
How can we actually introduce another element into it?

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.720
And the only thing I could think of

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.000
was actually to bring a flatbed truck in.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.280
And so we added, you know,

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.400
you had all the other surfaces

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.280
that people could work off and show there.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.920
So I thought, hang on, let's try that.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.080
It worked reasonably well.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:50.920
Definitely.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.400
And we used to get big audiences as well.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.240
We did massive audiences.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.800
And I know, very appreciative.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.560
I mean, the cheers for the costumes.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.600
And then particularly at the end,

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.960
when we tried to pick out the name of the theme,

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.360
the overarching theme of that year in fireworks

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.120
from the top of the museum.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.040
And that was the final moment.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.480
And people used to go completely ape-frozen.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.280
And you know, well, those were the days,

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.120
is all I can say.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:14.960
Absolutely.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.240
You were better.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.360
You probably wouldn't be able to do the flatbed truck

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.200
staging now.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.840
And the paratheques are largely out of the question as well.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.600
I mean, those are the days where health and safety

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.840
was a bit more lenient.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.440
Whereas now, it probably wouldn't be allowed.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.960
So I remember we had a particular dance sequence,

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.720
which is why we performed that on the back of that truck.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.560
Got it.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.760
So I remember distinctly, yeah.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.120
And being professional dancers,

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.520
I mean, what you had to offer was of a high order.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.360
It was, yeah.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.120
I mean, the whole point of that car would be that

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.520
there are people who have no previous experience.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.480
There are people who are experienced dancers.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.320
Yeah.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.160
There's room for everyone.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.840
I think that's one of the good things about the carnival

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.040
is that everybody could take part.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.640
There was no restriction in any way.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.480
And it didn't matter whether you were professional

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.640
or you weren't professional

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.240
and you just wanted to be part of it.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.440
You could take part in that.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.600
I think the joy of it is voluntary, you know.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.480
And we've always made it quite plain from day one

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.160
that nobody should ever do anything

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.680
that they don't care to do.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.120
I mean, there are people who've contributed

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.520
to the making of costumes over many years, but whom,

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.640
some have then come over to the performance,

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.200
but who've said, I don't care to you.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.120
And it's like, that's absolutely fine.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.160
You know, there's no right or wrong in carnival.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.000
There's just right.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.040
So everyone is free to do what they want to do, you know,

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:31.880
which is good.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.720
It was good.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.440
So yeah, so, and they were great fun.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.720
I mean, they were just, you know, you met new people.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.120
It was, and it was just fun.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.920
The whole process was fun and exciting and colorful.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.480
And, you know, just, it was great.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.280
It was just, you know, just something to enjoy really.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.920
I look at the smile on your face.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.760
It's all coming back to you, isn't it?

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.600
I know, yeah, it was.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.440
I mean, it was high energy.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.760
Yeah, definitely, it was really high energy.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.560
And it was just, it was just great fun.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.480
It was brilliant.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.640
Yeah, really good.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.680
So yeah, so I did that.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.640
And I kind of changed my job there

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.000
or changed what I was doing.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.280
And I became the Arts Development Officer

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.400
for the Vale of Glamorgan Council,

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.040
which I'm still doing quite some years later,

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.160
I think 18 years.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.560
18 years later, there we are.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.560
Bit of a time gem.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.000
But I think early on, I think because of my contacts

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.040
that I had in Cardiff and stuff,

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.400
I was able to sort of draw some of that

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.880
into the Vale of Glamorgan.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:40.880
And I can recall that we did some work

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.600
with Barry Carnival,

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.440
which had kind of dissipated really.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.320
It had sort of come to the end of its life

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.320
being a lot of flatbed lorries.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.120
There were lots of legal issues with that at the time.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:56.960
Health and safety issues as well.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.200
And times were changing.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.960
The health and safety, the insurance.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.280
There was loads of sort of issues.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.920
So they couldn't do what they'd done before sort of thing.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.880
So we sort of introduced the mass carnival

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.280
to Barry really, and did a big workshop

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:18.120
and with a lot of the community there,

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.280
all ages, young people, older people,

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.880
and ended up parading through Barry Town Centre

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:30.880
along Holton Road and right down to Romney Park,

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.840
I think where the parade sort of culminated

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.840
with small performances and different shows

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.080
and just showing the costumes

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.840
that people had made and everything.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:45.680
So.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.520
I remember you had very good weather as well.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.340
It was lovely.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.180
It was very good.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.000
In our 25 years in Cardiff,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.240
we have suffered the odd damage, as you can imagine.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.360
Definitely.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.400
But yeah, yeah, I think it was pretty good weather

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.240
on that day as well.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.840
I've got some quite, some good photographs

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.240
of that as well, which I'll have to dig out for you.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.080
I look forward to harvesting those

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.400
and putting them online in the archive.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.240
Yeah, yeah.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.800
I can remember the Barry carnival where, as you say,

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.280
Swicker had sort of been invited in

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.240
and encouraged by yourself to try and put some new impetus

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.640
and sort of, you know, intergenerational

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:23.280
and community arts approach into it.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.440
And some of the old guard who were actually

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.400
in their 60s and 70s found it very hard

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.640
to accept this approach.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.440
And it was quite sad on one level

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.400
because I remember they used to meet on a Sunday morning

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.960
and it took me a long while to encourage

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.640
some local teenagers from Barry to join me

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.440
to come to potentially be on this committee.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.920
Unfortunately, some of the elders on this committee

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.160
were so horrible to them that after one meeting,

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.040
they said that whilst they loved what we were doing

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.440
and would continue doing that,

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.800
they weren't prepared to sit in a room

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.920
and effectively be abused by some old guard

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.480
who didn't understand that things change.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.520
Yeah, yeah.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.480
So, I mean, and ultimately, sadly,

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.160
the Barry carnival died out, didn't it, Mealy?

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.480
It has really.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.720
I think in the last couple of years,

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.360
some of the local groups, theater groups,

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.120
and some people from the community have started

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:31.120
to rekindle a similar sort of event,

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:38.080
but sort of parading and walking through the town center

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.040
and creating a sort of bit of an arts festival,

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.640
which is now Barry Arts Festival.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.800
It's been running for about three years, probably,

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.080
where they have sort of evenings of music, entertainment,

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.200
workshops for young people,

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.720
and they do have a little parade

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.760
that comes through the town center as well.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.920
But that's only sort of rekindled itself

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.680
in the last few years.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.880
But there was a big time period, really,

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:10.680
where there wasn't a carnival, really, as such.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.560
We've had other events and things.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.920
It was motorized, whereas our approach

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:19.160
has always been walking and.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.000
Or pedestrians.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:20.840
Yeah, pedestrians.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.320
Yeah, it did help us to make it accessible to people

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:29.160
and to avoid pumping out diesel fumes all over everything.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.480
And all the legalities, like we've mentioned.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.560
And I think, so the traditional carnival,

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:40.560
I think, took quite a long time to kind of peter out, really,

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.280
and it was difficult for people

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.040
to accept something new and different

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.240
and something that really hadn't happened

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.680
in Barry ever before.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:53.240
So it was quite a big thing to kind of take on.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.280
And for those older people as well,

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.160
they've been used to organizing something very specific

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.640
that they knew how to manage,

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.560
whereas that was quite new to them.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.480
And people don't accept change very well very often.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.080
They say, oh, it's like me.

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.960
You know, so, like my.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.040
You know, yeah, I think it worked really well.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.920
What did happen in the end did work really well.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.840
And, you know, it was a lovely event,

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.520
but, you know, times change and things have moved on now.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.040
So, yeah.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.720
Tracy, thank you for all your carnival stories.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.720
I wish to award you verbally the badge of merit

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.920
of carnival hero.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.200
And yeah, thank you very much indeed.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.040
Thank you.
