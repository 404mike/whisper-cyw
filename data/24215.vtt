00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The sound of prayer.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Core. Cult. A fingertip of a lifetime of touch.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
These destitutes were robbed. Pickpocketed of fine gold thread.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
A sensuous and shiny line that makes each holder god.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The master of touch and time.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
A hand holding out, highlighting the particles of dust in the new air.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
A blind god feels these like silver pricks.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Stars glinting on the outskirts of his frame.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
He is the one with sea.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The one whose eyes are tunnel shaped and stretch out over the sky.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Feeling the sparrows and the sea anemones,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
he touches each spine of the sea urchin,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
plucks one and plunges it into the watcher's eye.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We are blessed with blindness

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and shaken out into all the dimpled corners of the solid world.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
In the rigid pearl hollow of a seashell.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
In the canyon bark branches of an oak tree.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Even on the surface of a newly pressed car roof.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
This is where we stay, in the very feeling of touch.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Like the sense of one's own skin against cloth.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Or unseen flesh pressed silently to air.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I believe in this feeling.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The only tangible answer to two hands clasped together.
