00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Castellano is from South America. I come from South America.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm a Latina.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Ok, so who is it I'm asking? Just for the introduction, if you're happy to say your name, your date of birth and where you were born, if you can say that in English and also in Castaneda?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Yeah, but you say Spanish if you want to.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Castellano. I know there's a lot of people.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I say Castellano sounds much easier than Spanish.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It's Castellano. We say Castellano because you pronounce the double L.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Ok, Liano.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Yeah, Liano. Because here they pronounce the double L as one and they say Castellano.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But because Castellano is another word, so we say Castellano. The pronunciation is important.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Because you can change the meaning, doesn't it?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Exactly. It's the same as, I cannot pronounce, like the sheep and the sheep, which is the big boat and the little animal.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I had to, I had to get it. You know. I mean Spanish is easier because you say Oveja y el barco.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Ok, so ship and the sheep.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And the sheep, the sheep and the sheep. And then they say, oh I don't know, you know the big, big sheep.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Big sheep, big whatever.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I don't know what. Ok, so please, can you tell us your name and where and when you were born?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Did you want to have my name as the married name or the single name?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It's entirely up to you. It's entirely up to you.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Yeah? Well, it's now because I'm married, so I will say that's Victoria Salas Senese.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I was born on the 26th of August 1947 in a place called Villazon, which is in Bolivia, South America.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Now, do you want me to say in Spanish?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Sure.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So we can just talk about you growing up in Bolivia, of course. Do you remember the area that you grew up in?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Yes, yes. It's called Villazon.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:39.000
It's in the 25th of May, that was the street where I lived. I was very close to my school, where we used to walk to school.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Yes, I remember very much. I do go at least every year I go back to my country because I miss it.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I miss my people. Yes.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And what was that experience like being able to grow up there and walk to school as well?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Very happy. I grew up in a very happy home, a very loving home. My mother was a workaholic and she brought up five children.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000
She worked very hard for all of us. All my sisters became professionals and all.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And I married to Jan. So I was 17 when I arrived to this country. And I came in 1965 when I arrived here.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:46.000
But yes, I remember my childhood very, very happy. Completely happy. I have no regrets. And I miss it all. My family. We were very united family and friends.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Yes, I do miss it. It's a saying that I have and I said, but I left Bolivia. But Bolivia hasn't left me. So I'm always coming back to it.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Is there a particular memory or memory you can share with us on growing up?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Growing up in the memory, the happiest is playing with my friends in the street. And I always remember that.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.000
They were allowed, but in the quiet when parents were busy, we used to sneak out and just the neighborhood, the children.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And they used to be a place, they used to be a San Juan they call. They used to burn wood outside in the streets.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So we used to go and jump all the fires with the children. We used to be, and this was the most memorable. I was really very happy.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And was there other kind of games that you can remember as well?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Yes, the scotch, what they call it, jumping on there. We used to flatten the tops of lemonade and all the little ones.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And we used to take up to the station and we used to put them on the line. So when they're drinking, we used to flatten them.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:24.000
So we used to make holes in it and then we used to make it for playing. And like a band, we had our own little band of things like that we used to make.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
That's incredible. That's quite clever as well actually, knowing that the train had gone through and then innovating and making it.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Yes, we used to put them and say, how can you flatten this up? It takes ages with a hammer.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000
So I said to them, what does it take them to the left? Because the train used to pass halfway because we live in the front there with Argentina.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.000
So the train used to pass and it had to stop. So of course we used to run and then put it all of a sudden underneath it.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Loads of them. When the train started, we used to watch, you know, they don't jump out. But because the train starts slowly, slowly, slowly.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So when the time it passes, they were all flattened. So we used to make the holes and put the strings in and play with it.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Always to put it in our face and pretend that we were Indians and then we used to dance. They were really brilliant as my childhood.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Even if it's about dancing, is there a certain event as well that you remember going as a family or as a group of friends?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Yes, we did. When I was in school, I used to pick a lot. I was being represented in a lot of things.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And I was very clever in my school that when it came to the end of the year, they used to put a big table at the entrance of the school.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And they used to put all my work there for the parents to see. Because I was very careful in writing.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I used to do drawing and all. And they used to put as an example of what we'd done. And they did that.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And then from, because we started from school, we have over there six years, school six years, college before you can pick to go to university.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.000
It's not like here, inside the college, university. Over there you had to do the school, college, and then you pick for university.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So six years. So I would say, I mean, but now at my age, I could say, yes, I was clever because I jumped from the fifth of the school.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:43.000
I jumped into college. I didn't do the sixth. I just jumped straight in. Like some, they have to repeat the class. I jumped.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So, yes, that was very, I can tell now, I am very observant and very attentive. I am very eager to learn. I love learning.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And I think that comes from when I was little because my mom said that when I was three years old, I used to read the newspaper.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:20.000
So, yes, I do many things. I said, God maybe hasn't given me that intelligence to be a professor or have a degree or masters, but he has given me a lot of talent in my hands.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:32.000
You name it, I do it. There is, my husband would be in the cabinet, I learned from him. I painted and decorated when I came to live here. That was my official, painted and decorated.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:45.000
I done curtains. I do anything. Do you want me to do it? I do it. I paint pictures. You know, and then over there when I was small, I used to, they used to call me the princess of the poetry.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And every Thursdays I used to be on the radio doing my poetry. And I was having a show off the way I used to do my poetry. I like to put everything into it.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:12.000
So when I used to go to the frontier, there is a bridge like that, to go from Bolivia to Argentina. The gendarmes, which are in Argentina, they recognize me. And they used to say, here comes the princess of the poetry.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And was there also like traditional, was there also traditional events?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Yes, I played football for college over there. I have played football. We went to different colleges to play and we used to win.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And I did have a lot of photographs, but because I moved so much in here when I arrived, that I lost some of them.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:51.000
But then when I was 14 over there, I was elected beauty queen of my country. And that was the first, the year. And then I done it for two years. They had it one year after the other.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And then when I went to Argentina then, I passed to Argentina in Buenos Aires. I went to study there.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And also there, they asked me if I could represent, there was the river plate, the club river plate in Argentina to represent them. So I had to go again.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:26.000
I wanted to be a nun. I love God so much. I wanted to be a nun. But my parents won't. So they accepted the first time when they went to my house to ask him, ask him to say, because they elect you.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
You don't go and say, oh I want to represent, I want to be, no, they elect you. They look at you and they elect you.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And they went and asked my parents if I can take part in this event, which they accepted. I didn't want to because when I had to put on my costume I was walking like this.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I didn't want to. But then after that I thought, oh well, I competed with my teacher and I won.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:11:04.000
She was older than me. I mean she had the body of a woman. But at that time I looked older. And yes, I won. And I passed them all.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:18.000
So lucky. And then the next year they asked me again. And then as I said, when I went to Argentina, they asked me, they asked me directly, they didn't ask my parents, they asked me directly if I would like to represent the river plate, the club river plate.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:29.000
I got photographs, you know, I got photo stuff there to show that I was. And they put me in this big car, things that we had to, they drove all the way to the stadium.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:43.000
So you have to go, you know, wave in and all that. Then you got the people who elected. They don't elect you. At the door you have to buy a ticket, a number.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And you say, I want to, you said I want to for Victoria. And then the people that come in, that's what they do. So at the end of the day, you go to the night to go to the dance.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And in there then you all sit down because nobody knows anything. And then they started taking how many tickets they sold for how many. And I won.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000
I won again. So I had the walls with my dad. It was lovely. That's memorable things.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And then as I said, when I went to Buenos Aires and River Plate and we went to do this thing around and everything, they did the same.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:28.000
You know, they started, they all sit down. They called the name in third place and so and so and second place and so and so. And then Cammy says in the first place say Victoria Salas.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And I'm, oh, again. But this time I was just, you know.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Comforting, right?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
More comforting. And I don't know.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Yeah, I had all that. And then I've been elected and so many things. And here, when we arrived here, I've been on television, salsa dancing.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
I've been a teacher of salsa dancing in Cardiff.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And you said you came here 17.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
I was 17. It was 1965 when I came here.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Okay. Yeah. And because I married to an officer of a ship.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
He was a first officer of a ship in Buenos Aires.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
I married him. Came here straight to Newport.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And I arrived on a plane. I came on a plane after.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And we lived in Malpass Road for a while.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
But our relationship, it wasn't as good as.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
We don't get on.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
We were black and white. You know, there was no gray.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
There was nothing in between to compromise or to try to get together.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
No. It's either this or it's either that.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And me, coming from a happy home, you know, I'm a very happy person.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
I'm very positive. And I was thinking, you know, this is not for me.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
I couldn't. So I sit down and said, look, this is not working.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
And bear in mind, I had two children.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And I was married at 17. I got at 18, 19, 20.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
At 22, I had my second child.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And at 22, about 23, 24, 25, 26, I was divorced.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
So I couldn't take my children because they had no family here to take them.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Or nothing.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
So I had to live on my own.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Find a place to live.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And I started working.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And learning and working.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And, you know, I came okay.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
I did okay. I had my ups and downs.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And I always think of God.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I think He has given me the two sides of the coin.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Because I came from a good home.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Which we had maids.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
We had nothing to do.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
And I arrived here, which I had to do it.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
You know, because, and it's like saying, once you become a mother, you stop being a woman.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
So I had to dedicate to my children.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
You know, everything for my children.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And then I had to go to work.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
We stopped working in the evenings.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
I didn't need to, but I had to do something.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
You know, I'm not a person to sit.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
I had to do something.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
And then after I had to leave my children with him.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Until I got to, we went to court.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
And I said, well I want my children.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
They won't have them because I had nowhere to take them.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
So I had to rent a room in Mendy.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
So I just dedicated to work.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
As I'm a hairdresser as well.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
A professional hairdresser.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
I got my diploma because I learned that over there.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
I told you, I'm a woman of many, many talents.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
And I had that.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I started working in the day as a hairdresser.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
In Mendy.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
And then I used to work in the night club as a barmaid.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And then I started working when night clubs up here.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
I used to work there as well.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
In the evenings I used to go out and work.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
So I just worked and then I needed to learn.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
I started learning more.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
I never went to school to learn English.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000
I learned on my own.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
But just asking people, please could you correct me.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Because I'm not sure if I am saying okay.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
And yeah, if anybody would say anything to me.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
I said, oh don't offend.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
I said, I'm not getting offended.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
I'm grateful that you corrected me.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
As long as you correct me the right way, that's fine.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Yeah, I came out.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Then I met my second husband now, Italian.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
And we're 42 years married now.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
And we have one child.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
You know he's 40 now.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
He lives next door to me.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Because he said, mommy says I love you so much.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
He said I'll marry you and I'll never leave you.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000
And I said to him, I know because I said you didn't want to.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000
You didn't marry me.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
He said you didn't love me because he lives next door.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
He lives next door to me.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
So yes, life has been good.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Near port, Wales have treated me with respect.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
And maybe in a way it's because I talk to anybody.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
My husband said you talk even to the birds.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
I mean when I'm passing by as in pigeons.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
I said excuse me ladies.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
My husband said you talk to anybody.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
I said I don't want to talk to you because you're going to be okay.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
And I said yeah, I said I have to.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000
You know, I didn't have no guidance of anybody.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
I have nobody to tell me I'm doing right.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
So I lived my life if you like.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
The best I could.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
And then when the pandemic came and we had to be locked.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
I started reading the Bible.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
And it changed me.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
And it changed me.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Made me understood a lot of things that I wanted to know.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Why?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
I didn't question God because he knows what he's doing.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
But I needed to know because I think God, you have given me a talent.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
But you haven't given me the place to try to work it out.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
You know?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Where my life has to be.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
And yes, it has changed.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
I had a good life.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
I mean I'm a decent person.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
I am not one of those.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000
I never smoke or drink, go to night clubs.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Never got the attention to be anything like that.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
It's the way we've been brought up.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
And I'm thinking I'm a mother.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
I had to respect myself.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Because I don't want anybody to see my children.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
I said, oh your mother, this is why your mother that.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
So that's why I brought my children.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
And I'm proud to say my children are good children too.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
That's fantastic.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
And I'm happy that you said it about learning.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Like wanting to learn.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000
And how all of your experiences were giving you.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Giving you like these moments to be able to learn something.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Yes.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
And then apply it if you wanted to as well.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
And then you have to take time to grow in the way that you needed to.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
And even, you mentioned earlier on about,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
I was going to ask whether it's from your mother in being at work.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Knowing that you need to work and regardless.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
That's right.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000
And how you ended up putting that for yourself.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Ready for the children as well.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
It's like they say, and what I learned from my mother is.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
You cannot teach your children.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Your children would learn by seeing you.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
We are the example to our children.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
So what I saw my mother.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
She was a great colleague she was.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
And she done everything to keep us good.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
I mean I couldn't really say.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
I couldn't have wished my mother was with me.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000
You know.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
And do things together with it.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
When she didn't work she dedicated her time to us.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
You know.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
And she used to be a wonderful cook and making cakes and all that.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
And I learned everything from her.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Which idols, idols I usually like.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
I bake.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
I do cakes.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
I sell.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000
My grandchildren won't have from anywhere else cakes.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000
I have to make them.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
So yes.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Life has been good to me.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Why is that important as well.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
To just be an example.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000
And you just said a little bit about the children and the next generation just learn.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
But why do you think that's very important.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
And why we should be carrying that on in terms of tradition.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
So young people can learn.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Well I think it's important to have a good example.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
And I think that's what I learned from my mother.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
And I think that's what I learned from my mother.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
And I think that's what I learned from my mother.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
And I think that's what I learned from my mother.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000
And I think that's what I learned from my mother.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
But my understanding is because to be a better person.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
To be a good person.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
I teach them to respect.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Regardless the gender, color, religion, whatever.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Regardless the gender, color, religion, whatever.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
I always teach my children to respect.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
You want to be respected.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
You have to respect.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
You know you cannot buy respect.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Respect has to be how you treat people.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Respect has to be how you treat people.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
And I always say to them they have to work.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
And I always say to them they have to work.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
They have to be good people.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
You have to help.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Who needs help?

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
You know you have to because this is me.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
I cannot see anybody.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
I have to be there.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
You know and I think can I help you?

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
You want anything?

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000
My neighbors they are ill.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
I'm there.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
You want to be good shop?

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
You know it's always thinking this is what God wants us to do.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Now I learned that and I'm thinking I'm not doing it for me.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
I'm not doing it really for them because that's what he wants.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
And it's like you say you're doing this to this person.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
You're doing it to me.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
And I'm hurting Jesus.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
And I cannot do that.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
You know it's not in my hands.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
So yes and I teach my children.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
And I thank God that they are very good.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
My kids they haven't been involved in anything.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Police or drugs or anything like that.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
I know they don't drink excessively.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
They don't smoke any of them.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
And it's because what they see at home.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Exactly.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
I'm going to read this here as an example.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
And speak about example as well.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Did you have an expectation of what Newport was going to be like?

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Before you moved here?

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Yeah.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Well when I arrived it broke my heart to leave my family and my country.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
But I was excited because I was young and it was an adventure for me.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Something different.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Something new.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:54.000
When I arrived in London they picked me up and they brought me.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000
And they took me.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
My husband was living in Lamberne.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
And they took me there.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
And I didn't realize how narrow the things had to go.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
And when the car was going I was like this.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
And he was still laughing.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
He was going and I was like oh he's going to go through that tree and all.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
And then when we arrived to the house I realized how little the doors are.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Because back home we have double doors.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Wherever we have.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
You go to the light room and you have double doors.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
And my bedroom was massive back home.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
I had my bed.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
I had all my stuff that I used to make.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
And I come in here and I thought this is doll's house.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
And people live in doll's houses in here.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
And the snow was up there when I arrived.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000
And I was expecting my first child.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Because I was expecting when I arrived like that.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
But I arrived in October and in November the 9th my child was born.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
In Lydia Baynon.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
It was called.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
I don't know what they are now.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
But it's not hospital Lydia Baynon in Ask.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Yeah he was born there.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
And because the snow was so far.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
And they put me into this room and I see the snow in there.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
And I just started crying.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Because I had never seen snow before.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000
And I thought she was so beautiful.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
And then all the squirrels were coming down.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
And I felt like Alice in Wonderland.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
And I thought so beautiful.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000
And I think how so different countries.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000
They have so many different things.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
And that's when I started getting deeper into learning more about things.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
About the Vikings.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000
How the Dachshund has come to be.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Why is English people which they are not pure.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Because they come in from what they call the Anglo-Saxons.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
And things like that.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
And then I started getting into history.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
And I love it.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000
I love it.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000
And I said to my husband when I watch it tell you.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000
I said I'm not watching to entertain me.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
I'm watching to learn.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
So yes.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000
And did you gather friends as well actually.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
In your experiences.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Whether it was wanting to learn or the things that you watch.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
The places that you go.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Were you able to start building friends.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Yes I have.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
I came in a new port.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
And I was learning only Latin.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Because nobody here speaks Spanish or anything like that.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
And as I said I couldn't speak much English myself.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Because I had to learn.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000
So yes I met one girl.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Somebody told me that it was a Colombian girl.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000
I met her.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000
And we embraced and we cried.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Because she also thought she was the only one.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000
So she lived in Malpas.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
So we were not far away from each other.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000
And yes we got together.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
And then from then on.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Then she started doing other things.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
When she met other Latins.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
When she introduced me to them.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Then I met more Latins.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000
I introduced them.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000
So in the end we had.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000
We had what you call it.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Isla Latina.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000
I don't know if you ever hear it.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
We used to go to.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000
What is the other place where they all go.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Eaton Road.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000
We used to go to Eaton Road.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000
We had a place there.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
We used to do parties.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
We used to gather there together.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Yes and the council.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
He used to give us.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Pay for us all the stuff that we used to do it.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
And yes that's where we came to be.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000
And we started learning from each other's cultures.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
With Colombia.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Argentina.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
It was only Bolivia but it were El Salvador.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
There were different countries.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
And then we used to gather together.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
And say each of you can we take a plate of your own country.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
So we used to put everybody will take something and put at the table.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Also then we used to eat.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Yes it was really nice.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Yes and that's like that's that culture and like preservation as well.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
It's a good way fantastic way to share culture and to carry it moving.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Is there other ways that you were able to do that as well.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Definitely for your children or other communities.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Yes when I came when I came when I didn't brought anything with me.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
It's only late when I started going back to my country.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
I started bringing little ornaments of my country.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
You know I got ornaments.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Yes I do have some and I introduced it to them.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Even ornaments from Argentina because we lived near frontier.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
And yes I brought it.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000
They call it a caucho.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
It's like the Americans they have the cowboys.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000
The Argentinians have the cauchos.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Which they get the cows you know in the countryside.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
There's such a site is beautiful site that is.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
The way they dressed and everything.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
The proper cauchos you know.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
And yes I brought things like that too.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
And I talked to my children about my culture my country.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000
You know about the Incas.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000
You know because that's what it comes from the Incas.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
And I said my mother used to speak Quechua.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
And she used to speak Aymara.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Which the Aymara is there actually before of the Incas.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
And when the Incas came there was the Quechua introduced.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Which is the original as Welsh will have the Welsh language.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000
So they had.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
My mother used to speak French, Spanish, Quechua.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
So she was quite clever as well.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
She's you know learned from her.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Yes that's what I do to my kids.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Incredible.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
They have to know they have to know your roots.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
And I always said to my husband I'm not going to die in this country.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000
I want to go back. I want to go back.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
But now that I went back last February.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
I was disappointed because everything has changed.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
There's so much. Everything has been closed.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000
Families and friends they passed.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
I don't like to say they died because we don't really die.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
We transcend it. We go to another level.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
And I always said we you know they all gone.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
It's not the same anymore.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
And this year I didn't because I should have been there now.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
I should have been there for a month, month, two months ago.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
But I should have been there.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
But then my poor husband I leave it always on his own for a long time.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
And then I said I promised him not to go.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000
And he said you say that every year.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
I said no. Every year I said I will not go next year.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
But I never promised.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
And I said you know my promises. I never break them.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
So I said I promise.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Even if I'm itching to go.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
And I think I should be there.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
And I said no I promise.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
And I'm not going.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
But I do get contacted with friends through the internet.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
You know through Facebook.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000
And we see through the camera each other.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000
Yeah it's a marvelous invention.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Truly.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Yeah I still get contacted with them.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
And my family and my friends.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
I went to the last time I went I told one of my friends I found her.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
And I said I was coming over.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
And she said when you arrive in.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
And I told her.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
And she said come over.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000
And he said I will wait for you.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000
And I did. And I didn't know that she passed on.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
And there were quite a few.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
We started from kinder to school to college.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
They were there.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000
All grown up.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
We all embraced and cried.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000
And no you don't remember this and remember that.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
It was also a little brilliant.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Brilliant brilliant.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
You know I got such a good memories.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Happy memories.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
It's something that you're not there.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
You're not going to repeat it.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
But it's all here.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
It's all there.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
And then goes into your heart.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
And so loving and thinking you know how lucky I have been really.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
To have such a good friends.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
And my family.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
So yes.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
And that experience and how important it is to just have gratitude.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Isn't it?

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
And to have them.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
And to be able to share it with others that have had experience and bring it together.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
So I wanted to just speak about Age Alive.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Is that here?

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
How did you end up coming in contact with Age Alive?

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:18.000
It's only just now that I'm beginning to try to get into them.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Because it's not very long that I joined them.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
But as I said I am a person that I don't like.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000
I don't like discrimination.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
As I said to you that regardless of whatever respect has to be.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
As I said you could be a master in whatever.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
You had your diplomas and you had this and you got that.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
But you're ignorant in respect.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
You know you could be yes I can do this and I can solve this and solve that.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
But what is your everyday life?

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000
How you treat people?

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Just because you are going to be a master or you go to thousands or whatever.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Or you live in a castle or whatever.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
That does not give you the right to look down to anybody.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000
Because in the eyes of the Lord we are all equal.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000
The Queen didn't bleed blue.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000
You don't bleed black.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
I don't bleed any brown thing.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
I have blood that is red to everybody.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000
And therefore we have feelings.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Same feelings that you have I have.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000
You can cry I cry.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
I laugh I laugh.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000
So therefore I said where is the discrimination and why?

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
It has no right anybody to discriminate anybody.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000
And that gets me.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Because I'm thinking please Lord do something about it.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000
There's nothing that you cannot do.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Why all these things happen?

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
And if I happen to be there and hear somebody say I have to step in.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000
And I say how on a minute who the hell do you think you are?

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
To talk at this person that way.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Look in the mirror yourself first.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
I always give him something for him to think about it.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
And I said to them you want to be respected.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Learn to respect first.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
If you don't know what respect is, it's an addictionary.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
I recommend you to have a good study of it.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
So yes.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
I was coming out of the church one day.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
And this lady was going up.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
I don't know if she was Indian or whatever.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000
From India or something.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
And she was coming up with a bag.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
And she said to me hello.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
I said hiya.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000
And he said are you coming up from there?

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000
I said no.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
I said I just come from the church.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000
He said would you like to join in?

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
He says come in.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
She says we bring food and we bring this.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Oh that's lovely.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
He said I'm taking samosas.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
And I looked at her and yes she done a lot.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000
He says have one.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000
I thought oh lovely I took one.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
And he says samosas.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
You know.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
And he says samosas.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
She's driving me so that I can't go there.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
And I said to her well I cannot make it today.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
But I said well I will come one day.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000
But it passed weeks.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
And it's I don't know if you believe it like when you hear something telling you.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
I do.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000
I'm very spiritual as well.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
I can tell you that.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000
And it's always the ghost belief that I guess somebody's telling me that I should go there.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000
You know.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
And I said to my husband you know what I said Wednesdays.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000
I said the lady I'm sure she said Wednesdays.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000
I said I'll come because I go to mass.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
And then when they end the mass I can see the people going.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
So I was outside you know thinking should I go in.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
And what do I say.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000
What are they going to say.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000
You know and all that.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Because I look and then I think well there's a lot of black ladies we go in.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
The way Indians with the way they dress that they will go in.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000
And I said well I can't.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
They will say me what happened.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
I thought oh well never mind.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000
I'm Victoria.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000
I thought I'd come in.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000
I opened the door.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Good morning everybody.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
And then Troy called me.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
He went.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
And I went in and introduced him.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
So I said well I cannot remember who invited me here.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000
But I said you know I.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000
And then they all welcomed me.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000
And I they made me at ease.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
And then I thought oh I like this.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
So they from them and then I started going.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000
You know to them.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
But I don't say anything.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000
I don't express any opinion.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000
I just sit back and listen.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
I'm learning.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
I study people's you know who your personalities and all that.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Yeah I don't.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
I don't.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000
And I said to me you have to say it and you can't this and that because you're one of us.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
And I think okay thank you very much.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
But I still in the background.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000
I don't.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Because if I might say something somebody else they don't agree.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000
So I think you know I better shut up and then see what everybody's doing what's happening.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000
It's only when sometimes they say do you agree.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Then you say OK.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
I don't agree.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Yes OK.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000
So what does it mean to you as well.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
What does it mean to you.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000
They do a lot of hard work.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000
And I think they are on.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
I was there in my page.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.000
You know they are on my page because what are they trying to do is what I believe that she should be done.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000
And maybe because I haven't got the knowledge to for me to go forward and do what they do it.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000
But as I said I'm learning.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:50.000
And as I said it's respected and is trying to help the people that they need.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
And you know whatever I get on.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000
I think anyway I don't know whether they agree or not.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000
But I think I get on with them.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000
It's like my husband said who could not get on with you.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
She said you know I mean the way you are.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000
You always talk.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
I go on a plane.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
I talk to the people who they go in.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000
And we go into laughs by the time we arrive there.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000
It's like that.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000
If I'm waiting at the bus or something and I'm always talking to the next one.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000
You know.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000
And it's cold isn't it.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000
You start with something and then we laugh.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000
That's life.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
You only hear one's wife doing it.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
You know.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000
And I think if everybody would think that.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
We only have one chance.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Any problems you have in life it can be solved.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Except death.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000
That is one thing that you cannot solve.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000
You can go on holidays for a month or two.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000
But you know you're coming back.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000
The one who died is not coming back.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
And it's good.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Said so.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000
Otherwise he takes his breath away and that's it.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
So I always say to them why.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Why not being happy.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Why not being positive.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000
At the end of the day you're not doing it for the person.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
You're doing it for yourself.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000
You know.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000
If you have love in your heart.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000
You won't have nothing else to give.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000
You won't have anything else to give.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Yeah.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
If you are nasty and you're always with some negative stuff like that.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
I said that's what you give.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000
That when people I see people like that.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000
And I think of course she's got a very sad heart.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000
You know.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000
That's what I'm thinking.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
I wish we could change her.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000
Yeah.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000
And I'm quite spiritual.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000
I talk to God.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Every night.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
I talk to my angels.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000
And I tell you one thing why I believe so much in the miracle.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000
In my house.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000
You know the steps to go upstairs.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000
I was on the fifth cleaning.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
And you got the cord got stuck.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
Now bear in mind I was cleaning standing like this.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000
And it got stuck.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000
So I went like this and pull it.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000
And the cord pulled me back.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000
And I went diving like that.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000
Now when I did this.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
There's the radiator here.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000
That's the front door there.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000
And the space from there to there.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000
The houses that we have.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Now with the way I landed there.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000
I should have banged exactly.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
But I promise you.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Someone was holding my head like this.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
I felt my head was like this.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Because when you back.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000
What it goes is your head first.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000
Your head you got.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
It's your head.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
When I landed I landed it.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
And I felt a hand because my head was like this.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
And I thought.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Thank you God.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Because otherwise if I would have been completely cold there.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
When my husband came back from work.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000
He would have had to push the front door.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000
To get me out of the way.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000
And that was early in the morning.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000
In Spain I had my car.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000
I went around the corner.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
I don't know whatever happened.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000
I felt an explosion.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000
And then I thought oh.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
I could feel the car going and I break and all like that.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000
And suddenly I could see people running and all that.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
And I opened the door to go.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000
Everybody said are you okay?

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000
I said yeah I'm fine.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Your neck?

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000
No I'm fine.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000
When I look at my car.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000
It was completely gone.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000
The tires exploded.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000
All the chairs where I was seated.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000
All it was open completely.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000
It was open.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000
I don't know how.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.000
And everything from there was high in.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000
They had to call the.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000
What do you call it?

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000
They took my car and they took away.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000
And all the scratches.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000
And I was thinking thank God.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
I always thank God because I think he's the one who looks after me.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
And here at the hospital when I went to have x-rays.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
My husband says Vicky the way you fall and all that he said.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000
Because I was 60 when that happened.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
And that's our bones at that age.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000
It started getting just a bit.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
And I got to try this.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Which makes it even worse.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000
And when I went in there I had my x-rays and everything.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000
They can't see no one's scratch.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000
And he said to me somebody's looking after you.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000
He says at your age you should have at least something broken.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Or something.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Nothing.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000
On the x-rays.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Nothing.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.000
And it's me praying when I go there.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000
I just pray and pray.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000
And the first thing I always say thank you Lord.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Thank you so much for this.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000
So.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Thank you.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Thank you so much for sharing.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000
And for expressing this.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000
Which I have never really talked to anybody so much about it.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Because I don't think many people are interested in somebody's life.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
But I think it is interesting really to find out.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000
That's why when I go to these people.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000
They age alive.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
I ask them little questions about their cultures.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
And you know how do you feel about it.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000
And all this.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000
And quite a few of them have come when they were young.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000
They all think the same.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000
They like to go back.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000
You know.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000
I always say to my husband I don't want to die in this country.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000
And I don't want to die here.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000
I want to go home.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000
I want to go home.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000
I said that is my home.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000
I have to go home.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000
But now I thought come on Victoria think about it.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000
My home is here now.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000
For 58 years that I've been here.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000
And I'm thinking it is my home here.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000
I have my children here.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000
My grandchildren.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000
I thought maybe you had a reason to bring me here.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000
I'm a very strong believer in things happen for a reason.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000
It always happens for a reason.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
A friend of mine is supposed to go away.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
His wife decided to do something.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000
She went back.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000
And they missed the coach.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000
He was mad.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
And she said yeah but I can help it.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Halfway there.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000
This is a time years ago.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
The coach had an accident.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000
There was no survivors.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
See.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
There is a reason why they bring you back.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000
And I always say to my husband if you want to do something.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000
But suddenly something happened.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000
I said don't hurry for anything.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000
I said there is a reason why it's happening.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000
I said listen.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
What God says your eyes look your ears listen.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000
I said they telling you.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Do you know they wake me up at 3 o'clock in the morning.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
And I never understood why I wake up every morning.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000
At 3 o'clock in the morning.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000
And then I realized now and they said the God wakes you up.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Because I'm spiritual.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000
Maybe.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000
And I think now I understand.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000
So what I do I get up and pray.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000
You know pray for the world.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Pray for the people.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Pray for everybody who is vagus.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
And I said to them give him strength and carry on.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000
I talked to them.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000
And some of them I said.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Why are you in this business.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000
And I said but why are you in this street.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000
And these stories they tell you.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000
It's so hard.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000
It's you know you can cry.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000
And a lot of people they said oh because they have drugs and because they drink it.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000
And I said before you judge anybody.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Find out why they drink.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Why in drugs.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Why is he I said in the cold.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000
And I said and he has to feel the cold.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000
But I said if he drinks.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.000
And he passes.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000
He will feel the cold.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000
And he said look and when I talk to the people that's what they tell me.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000
And they said I don't want to.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000
I don't like it if I have a place where to stay.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000
But he said with this I fall asleep.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000
And don't feel nothing until I wake up the next day.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000
And it's so sad.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000
That shouldn't happen.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000
It shouldn't happen.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000
You're never going to know unless you have those conversations and ask them.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000
It's like you mentioned earlier on about that.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000
The respect as well.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Exactly.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000
And he was the same.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000
He was a what do you call it.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Selling magazines.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000
And he was only I think he was 18 19.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000
And I started talking to him and I gave him clothes of my sons.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Because they were more or less the same and all.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
And my son he had to buy something that he don't want it and all that.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000
So I used to get the clothes and I used to give it to him.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000
I said darling I said if you don't want to.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
I said you can give it away to somebody else or sell it.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000
I said you have a lot of money.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000
No he said no thank you so much.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000
And then he says what was your name.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000
And I said Victoria.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000
And I said what was yours.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000
I think it was Paul.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000
And I said okay Paul nice to meet you darling.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000
I said you take care of yourself.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000
I give him money to have breakfast or what have you.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000
And I haven't seen him for a while.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000
And then suddenly Victoria.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Victoria.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000
And I turned around.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000
I said I'm your Paul.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000
I said why couldn't you look good.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000
I said why.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000
He said I got a girlfriend.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000
I got a place and I'm going to be a dad.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000
That was lovely.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000
I said I'm glad I said now.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000
Be a good father.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
Yes I said you want it.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000
I said you pretend I'm your mom.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Yeah I said and I'm telling you be a good father.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.000
Stay away from the streets.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000
I said you didn't like that.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000
So think you don't want your child to be in that situation.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000
So I said as a father you have to fight.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
I said because now you stop to be a man.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
And now you're a father.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000
Think not on you.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000
Think of where you go there.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000
That's precious.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.000
And that is a gift from God.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000
I said don't ruin it.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000
Don't throw it away.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000
I said I respect your wife.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000
I said communicate.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000
You don't like what she's doing.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Let her know.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000
No shouting.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000
No screaming but with words.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Respect.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000
You respect her.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000
She will respect you.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000
So what life will be is how I practice.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000
I'm passing on to you.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000
I've been down.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.000
I have been in a marriage.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000
They didn't work.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
And I have been gone down.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000
And I said but I come up because determination.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
And you think you have to love yourself first.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Respect yourself first.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000
And then it will be easier to give to the rest.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000
And the rest will see in that.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Will come back to you.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Now if it's a person who will insult you or say something.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Rather than you tell him oh the words that you use.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000
No you come down and say oh God bless you.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000
Simple.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000
You know what a person will do.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000
He will feel like that.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000
Because he's aggressive.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.000
He's all these.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Are you calm?

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000
Because all your emotions come from here.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000
And if you learn to control that and pass that into that.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Which is the intelligence.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000
And I said you just say anybody say anything.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000
God bless you.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.000
And you will be happy with the words on their mouth.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Or not.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Do you agree?

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000
There you are.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000
So have I answered all the questions?

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Indeed you have.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.000
And more.
