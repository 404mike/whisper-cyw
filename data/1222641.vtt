00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360
He ran the Cardiff border shkita. Again, in Cardiff we used to do our own shkita.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.560
So there was a ritual slaughtering took place in Cardiff and it was under the guidance of Rabbi

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.160
Rogoznitsky. When I was growing up there used to be a ritual slaughter in Hebrew called a shokhet

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.160
and they used to be employed by the community on a full-time basis, shokhet in Cardiff. Even

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.280
to digress even further, in Myrtha Tidvill they also used to do their own shkita and there was

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.160
a minister called there, the minister I can remember, the minister of shokhet was Reverend

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.520
Fine and his son who lives just around the corner of his called Rabbi Fine who was a minister in

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.760
Southgate and Cockfosters. So yes, there was rituals. My father was very adamant that had to

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.720
keep on going. There was a ritual slaughtering done in Cardiff. We used to have our own shokhtim,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.000
the literal slaughterers and many of those have got family or are still in contact with

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.720
and are in London. So Grape was a child that he was involved in. We're not just talking chickens

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:03.440
here, no, we're talking animals, cows. To the extent that when I was already in my 18th because

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.720
I was driving a car and my parents were away once on holiday and I happened to be at home and I was

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.600
giving the Rabbi, Rabbi Rogoznitsky, a lift back from Cathedral Road Synagogue one morning and he

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.480
said to me, Adrian have you got any time to spare? And I said yes. Why? He said I want to go and

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.160
check up on the shokhtim, on the slaughtering. I said fine. So I said but Rabbi you're old and

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.560
the Rabbi suffered from Parkinsonism and he couldn't walk very well. I said well,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.320
Rob, how are you going to get in and out of the slaughterhouse? He said don't worry,

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.880
I'll sort that out. So we went there. The shokhtim that day was a Rabbi Smith from who lived in Brighton

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.600
and we got there and he said go and tell the slaughtermen I've arrived. We went to tell the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.200
slaughtermen we've arrived. They then came out with a chair. They put the Rabbi on a chair. They took

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.000
him all the way through on the chair. This is before I'd even had breakfast in the morning

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.880
and I then watched as they slaughtered at least two cows and then checked them because part of

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.480
the process of when they do the slaughtering you've got to do certain checks. You've got to check the

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.560
no blemishes on the lungs as an instance. So I watched as they slaughtered these two cows.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.280
Another aside, a little smaller side, this Rabbi Smith who I just mentioned was a shokhtim, was an

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.520
old gentleman and he the shokhtim, my father in charge at the time, the slaughtermen said at one

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.080
point refused to work with him and they said Rabbi Smith I'm very sorry you're too old. We don't

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.880
trust you anymore. You're going to do damage. So he said to them that's fine. He said will you work

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.240
with me if we have a competition and I win? And they said what type of competition? So he said if

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.480
we have a push-up competition and I win, he said that you bring your fittest man and I will do

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.360
push-ups on the floor against him now. If I win, I stay on. If he wins, I will leave immediately.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.200
Rabbi Smith was working the next day. He used to walk regularly from Stanford Hill to Golders Green.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.600
He was a very fit gentleman. He might not have looked fit but he was. I also remember being in

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.960
the Rabbi's house talking about shkita when in order to do shkita you have to use what they call

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.920
a chalif which is a special ritual knife. That knife is going to be razor razor sharp and have

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.040
no indentations. You check that by running it against your thumbnail. Again the Rabbi was an

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.000
old dodgery as I would say. I had all respect for him. He wasn't dodgery but that's the way I describe

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.160
him and he then ran his back of his nail against this knife to check it was kosher and it was there.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.800
So that's my story about shkita. Where was the slaughtering taking place? The slaughtering was

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.160
taking place in Cardiff in I don't remember where the slaughterhouse was. I thought not mistakenly

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.640
it was in town somewhere. There was a slaughter. It was a non-Jewish slaughterhouse which was a

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.680
section and in order to do Jewish slaughtering you have a pen and the animal is then turned upside

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.640
down in the pen and its neck is sliced. And that was done in I remember going there. I can't

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.080
remember exactly where it was. I think it might have been in Canton. I can't remember offhand though.
