00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Black men in court, that's Afro-Caribbean, Arab mainly and African.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is part two of the Cardiff riots.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Black men found guilty in Swansea court as a result of their role in the Cardiff riots.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Well despite 15 men being taken to court, some with very obvious injuries,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the court acted in a reasonable and fair way towards them.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The press may have placed all the blame on the black people of Butetown and Grangetown,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
but the court did not.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The offences punished were largely unavoidable in terms of punishment.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
They were mainly gun related in relation to violence towards the police

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and shooting directly into the crowd.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Black men found guilty were Mohammed Ali, Ali Abdul, Ivor Gabriel Lenzman

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and Mohammed Qaid, also known as Ahmed Khalad.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So only four men were found guilty.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Others found not guilty or no evidence presented were Ismail Mohammed, Cham Ali,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Sali Abdullah, Sayed Ben Sayed, Farah Mohammed, Mohammed Hassan, John Tucker,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Mohammed Sharif, Issa Mohammed, Mohammed Abderi and John Abdullah.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So the four black men who found guilty were sentenced to prison in Swansea court.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The four men were, as I say, Ali Abdul, who was age 26, a fireman on the merchant ships.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
He was given four days imprisonment for assaulting Frederick Gregory, a police constable.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I should add he'd already been in prison for nearly seven weeks.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Sub-waiting trial.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Ivor Gabriel Lenzman was age 21, a ship's cook,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and he was given a three year prison sentence for shooting at Sydney Jones, William Clark and James Coombs.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Ahmed Khalad, known also as Mohammed Qaid, age 25, a ship's donkeyman,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
was given 15 months hard labour for shooting at John Porter, a police constable.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Mohammed Ali, age 27, was given three months hard labour for shooting at Henry Brotherton and Ernest May.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Except for John Abdullah, who is listed as a shopkeeper but was also a boarding house owner,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
all of the black men were in the merchant navy at the time of the riots,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and therefore it's extremely likely that they were also involved in World War I.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Now, thanks to the Cardiff Story Museum, we know that a number of people were compensated

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
for loss of goods and damage during the riots, the bulk of those being in Butetown.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Some of these were among the men that appeared in court.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000
The figures I'm going to quote show the actual amount received and the modern equivalent in 2017,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
according to the National Archives in London.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Mohammed Ali, now he was found guilty in court and was sentenced to three months hard labour.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Nonetheless, he received £67.10 compensation, a modern equivalent of £1,961.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And so we can understand that in a real context, what we're also going to do is quote,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
what that meant if you were a skilled tradesman, that's the high level of salary.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So that would have been 204 days wages for a skilled tradesman at that time.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:55.000
John Tucker received £30, that's the equivalent in 2017 of £886.26, 92 days wages.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Mohammed Sharif received £14, £421.34 in 2017 money and 43 days wages at the time.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Now, John Abdullah, who owned a shop and boarding house, which was the centre of a lot of the damage,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.000
received £175. Now that's the equivalent of just over £5,000.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And it was 531 days wages. Issam Mohammed received £12, £348 equivalent, which is the equivalent of 36 days wages.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Ismail Mohammed received £7, £203.14 in 2017 and 21 days wages.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Saeed bin Saeed received £4, £116.23 equivalent and 12 days wages.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Fahra Mohammed received £5, £145.29 equivalent and 15 days wages.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Sali Abdullah received £6, the equivalent of £174.35, 18 days wages.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And Mohammed Hassan received £5, the equivalent of £145.29 and 15 days wages.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So although the events were savage and caused some serious physical injury to the black merchant seaman,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
the treatment they received in court reflected the fact that they did not start the riot.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Also the compensation amounts were significant at that time.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So despite the press consistently, for most of June, placing the blame for the Cardiff riots on black people living in Cardiff,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.000
that was not the conclusion reached by the court. And they received compensation for loss of belongings and damage to property.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:02.000
It's interesting to note that even that these events occurred 20 years before the start of World War II.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And despite racist attacks, brutality by white mobs and overt threat to their families,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000
these black people returned to the sea in World War II to assist Britain.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:25.000
In World War II, at least 645 Arab merchant seamen serving on the British merchant navy died.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Of the 479 men who listed their last known address, 242 sailed out of Wales.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.000
30 from Barrie, 12 from Swansea, 10 from Newport, 189 from Cardiff.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Our research shows that 330 men born in the Caribbean died serving on the UK merchant navy in World War II.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
56 of those listed their last known address as Wales.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
3 from Newport, 11 from Barrie and 42 from Cardiff.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
These men left at least 35 wives behind in Wales.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Also there were sisters, daughters, brothers and mothers listed in next of kin.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Now this shows that the riots, racism, attacks, failure of government, unions and others to support men,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.000
none of this changed their commitment to settling in Wales and becoming black citizens in an often unfriendly environment.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:41.000
This is really important because for those of us who are black but of mixed race,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
third generation nowadays and fourth and fifth generation,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:59.000
the statement of intent made by those people during and after the 1919 race riots,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:07.000
after having been involved in World War I and after a tremendous loss of life in World War I within their community,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
that statement is why we are citizens of Wales today.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Now in chapters 17 to 20 we'll show the brutality of the environment in the United States,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:31.000
an environment that also had race riots in 1919, an environment ruled by Britain's closest allies.
