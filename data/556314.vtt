WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.800
So I'm with Brigitte and we're going to talk about your memories of the Siempris disaster,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.140
the oil spill and what were your first memories of, how did it first affect you?

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:33.300
How did it first affect me? What I remember is seeing the news about it the night when the

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:42.580
storm or something happened and that boat that ran aground and then I had a call from some friends

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:49.700
in France who said to me, oh we've just seen a program about the tanker in Pembrokeshire and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:57.740
etc and we're so sorry to hear that and I was saying well nothing's happened yet but on the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:06.580
French news they had a lot more information than we did and that was my first memory.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.220
What were you doing at the time in Temby? What was I doing with my life you mean? Well we were

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:26.620
living in Havertz so it was quite a busy household. James was working in the hotel and I was working

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:40.700
as a French teacher at the time and kids were little, we were on the beach all the time with

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:55.900
them and it was really quite scary to watch it happen and think but surely you know can't

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:05.620
they do this or why don't they do that? You know everybody had that way that humans have which is

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:18.660
to deny what we're seeing with our own eyes or blame or think there must be a better solution

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:28.980
and it was it was really quite hectic, didn't know what to think. So you just walked down to

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:38.100
the beach? And so it took I don't remember exactly how long it took, the oil didn't arrive in Temby

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:51.220
straight away, maybe took a couple of days or something and the morning it arrived in Temby,

00:02:51.220 --> 00:03:04.540
yeah we walked down to the seafront and just looked at this crowds of people all ages,

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:14.980
you know everybody was there and people were crying, that was the main thing we could see,

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:26.100
people were had tears rolling down their faces, old men, teenagers, children, you know everyone

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:38.700
was just so horrified and grieving, there was a shock and it was horrible,

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:55.700
I've never experienced grief at that scale, I've never been such a you know a whole population and

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:10.620
even those who weren't there you could feel the whole county was in shock and at the time I was,

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:23.100
I don't know if I started studying counseling but certainly maybe I was 96, yes I had and

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:35.460
obviously just feeling that grief and feeling the natural kind of response to grief which is to

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:49.660
gather up and talk with people and comfort each other and you know all of that, so in the same

00:04:49.660 --> 00:05:06.020
way as if somebody had died, it felt like a natural thing to want to be together and not

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:16.020
just together in our houses but together by the sea because it felt that there were all these

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:27.300
animals that had died, millions of things big and small and birds and shells and you know

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:45.260
it was very strong, strong that feeling that there had been a massive death of creatures

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:56.140
and obviously for us humans the consequences of that that we understood or didn't understand

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:09.340
or knew about or didn't know about but we could feel the impact and so yeah I went home and took

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:17.140
my you know it was before computers, before we had computers in our own homes, before we had mobile

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:30.420
phones so I just took my diary and my phone book and just ran every single number that was on there

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:43.060
and told people if they wanted to meet up on Castle Hill, maybe a couple of nights from then,

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:57.060
I was in the fun all day just and then people saying I can't come but you know I'll light a

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:06.580
candle or light a fire in the garden or and so it happened here but I was away, it was also happening

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:18.340
in other places and then that's what happened. So how many people came? I don't know, there was

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:30.340
quite a lot of, hundreds, probably something like that, wow, a lot of people and we're just

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:40.020
looking at the sea. Was it quiet? Yeah it was it was quiet and it was yeah it was quiet and it was

00:07:40.020 --> 00:08:00.540
quite sombre and it's like you could feel something quite powerful really and then I remember feeling

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:24.460
a bit not so happy at one moment because the local of VÃ©ca kind of took three paroles, decided to say something

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:38.100
and I don't remember what he said but suddenly there was a sort of religious something which

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:55.100
I felt wasn't very sensitive because it went way beyond anything human and I don't know,

00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:02.060
I thought it was a bit of and at the same time I can see the temptation you know you gather people,

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:10.500
you need a speaker and there wasn't one and so he did that and I'm sure for a lot of people it

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:21.420
was the right thing to do. I find at times like that you have to be sensitive to the language

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:33.100
that you use so that people don't feel excluded but then we're all very used to things like that

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:41.140
happen so people who wanted to listen and people who didn't just moved along a little bit and it

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:56.300
was fine there were lots of kids, lots of families. How long did it last? Maybe an hour,

00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:08.620
something like that. We were there for quite you know quite a few hours obviously we were

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:19.900
there beforehand and then stayed on talking with lots of people. I met Kara Wilson whom I had not

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:28.900
met before and we got talking and then ended up doing this event in the Queen's Hall together

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:43.860
with also Beatrice from Manabeel Castle. She was involved in our little group and Emma was I think

00:10:43.860 --> 00:11:00.820
Kara's sister-in-law. Yeah just four of us. We got a little bit of funding, invited these people

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:06.700
to come and do these workshops and took part in that. Tell me a bit about the people that came

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:18.220
who did the workshops? There were young people I've just reread the you know the posters and

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:25.260
the bits of paper that I kept from then and it's better explained on there than but I just remember

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:35.380
that they were part of a sort of international youth sustainable ecology kind of green group

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:48.500
and they were touring Europe with display boards and information and they were running workshops

00:11:48.500 --> 00:12:01.740
in schools and community halls and on issues of ecology and so we got them to come to Pembrokeshire.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:09.300
They were here for maybe four or five days and contacted lots of schools, primary schools,

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:21.940
quite a few answered and were keen and so they hosted them and the group delivered sort of art,

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:33.020
drama workshops. I remember one I think it's the one they did in 10B because I think one of my

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:44.340
nieces was in the class where they did it and it was something where they were pretending to make

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:52.220
the noise of the rain in a rainforest so they started maybe getting them to tap lightly on the

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:57.980
desk with their finger and then a bit harder and a bit harder and yeah I remember my niece coming

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:05.420
home and telling me about that so you know they would have done things like that. Did they talk

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:14.780
about the Sea Empress? Did they relate it directly to it? Well it all happened around the same time

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:30.140
and I suppose people were connecting it in their mind. I don't know they weren't here to

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:42.940
to make any decisions or any comment about this particular. They were talking in general I think

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:59.100
about pollution and about yeah all those issues. I don't know I don't think they were focusing

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:05.900
only on the sea. I suppose if it was that fresh they wouldn't have needed to make the connections.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:13.140
No I think everybody including children were very aware around that time that we were going

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:19.980
through an ecological disaster so everything that had to do with the world and etc they were very

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:32.140
aware that their world had taken a beating and I think we're very sensitive to anything that was

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:42.940
helping them to maybe stay positive and maybe think of the future with a feeling that they

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:53.100
could do something to enable the planet to survive all these things. I think it was done

00:14:53.100 --> 00:15:05.220
in very much in a future orientated and giving people giving children particularly a sense of

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:16.260
optimism that we didn't just have to suffer things like that. We could make gestures and

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:29.220
decisions and that would lead things in a better direction. That was the idea.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:40.820
So and the Queen's Hall is that's where you had your? That's where we did the main we had a

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:53.540
workshop in the daytime and then there was a gig in the evening and an exhibition and a competition,

00:15:53.540 --> 00:16:13.740
a recycling competition and we had Dennis Curry who came to be our judge and at the time the

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:20.180
people from the gallery in Arbuth who gave a prize you know it was all very low key but

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:34.860
the exhibition was called Pollution? Yes, yeah. That run obviously for a longer over a longer

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:51.580
period a few weeks or something I think and went with that group set we went to different

00:16:51.580 --> 00:17:00.540
places including one day they set up outside I don't remember what the shop was called at the

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:09.420
time but one of the supermarket brands in the one that's in Pembroke Dock next to the library

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:19.260
and they went and asked the manager if they could set up their little display thing outside the shop.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:27.820
Manager was quite happy with that so we spent a few hours there giving leaflets to people and

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:39.980
etc and I remember obviously they were challenging people's and it's interesting

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:47.580
because we're looking at 20 years ago and of course then people we were all still using plastic

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:59.340
bags left right and center and and I remember one of them had kind of maybe pushed the boat

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:08.620
a little bit too much with the people at the till in the shop he got told off I think anyway

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:18.140
because it was the time when at the till people had access to all these plastic bags

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:25.740
they were just coming out of the you know people went counting we were just using using using and

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:33.980
and it was the time when you couldn't buy anything from like if you bought some cheddar

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:40.940
they would put that in a see-through plastic bag and then put it in the carrier bag yeah and so

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:50.460
those young people from set had gone to buy a few things and and had you know stopped the queue and

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:58.220
and kind of made this big spill that they didn't want their vegetable or their cheese or etc to be

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:04.940
put in separate plastic bag in style the plastic bag and people at the till who were saying that

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:10.300
it was their instruction and they had to do it and so that you know there was a bit of a

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:19.980
faffle about that but yes that was 20 years ago and a lot of the people around were looking at these

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:25.420
young young people looking a bit scruffy

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:36.700
speaking with foreign accents all of them making a fuss about plastic bags and look now yeah

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:45.100
last progress very slow progress but and look how proud people have been that

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:55.100
you know that Wales has stopped using plastic bags way before England started it you know and people

00:19:55.100 --> 00:20:04.780
are proud of that so yeah it is interesting to see how and I guess at the time the whole idea with

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:15.980
this project set was sowing seeds you know just putting ideas out for people to sort of

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:23.900
look at and maybe challenge or or take on board or

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:34.460
it must have been quite powerful for kids because they like we said that they they had experience

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:46.220
that's a real event to link it to I want because now it's just it just seems so removed doesn't it

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:54.860
to what we we experience we're we're supposed to be aware but when it's actually on your doorstep

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:59.980
but that's the whole thing and it's it's always been like that and

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:10.060
you know it's the the power of the connection that we are able to make or to filter out and

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.020
you know before the seampress and since the seampress there's been

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:25.820
huge catastrophes and if you're connected with you know you might be living in Wales but maybe your

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.700
you know you might be living in Wales but maybe your

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:40.380
children or best friends or whatever live on the coast of some other countries somewhere else and

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:47.260
and you hear of a catastrophe like that there and you're going to feel it a lot more

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:54.540
than if you don't know anybody who lives there and then it's a news item and then it's you know

00:21:55.260 --> 00:22:02.620
a bad thing and you you kind of you'll have some level of feelings about it some level of

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:12.860
thinking about it but unless you're you've been there you're connected with the land itself or

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:19.100
you know people there it's not going to mean the same thing to you and I think that's just the

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:26.700
only way we have to cope with the level of information that gives us

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:37.820
information at the level of the planet it's it's a bit too big for most of us I think to really

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:44.140
take every single thing that happens with the same level of empathy we'll go mad

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:52.620
yeah we'll go mad if we did that and the the exhibition was in june is that right

00:22:52.620 --> 00:23:06.860
I think I saw that on there maybe I can't quite remember yes in june so all the oil would have

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:13.900
gone by then or yeah not visible to the eye it wasn't visible anymore because you know that

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:27.900
obviously it's a touristic place and they tried very hard to make the beaches usable by easter

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:35.580
and were you really amazed at that did you think it was going to just never get back to normal again

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:47.660
um no we didn't think it would never get back to normal we knew it would even but we didn't know

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:59.100
how long obviously the sort of easter seemed not long enough for sure but then the biggest problem

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:07.260
was the difference between what you can see and what you can't see and although the beaches were

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:21.420
clean you couldn't see any oil um none of us I'm saying none of us a lot of people didn't feel

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:27.500
confident we didn't go down the beach in pembrokeshire at all we didn't step on the sand

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:33.500
really I was gonna ask you about that because I'm quite interested in that fact to sort of

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:40.700
get an angle on when local people started going back down to the beaches or when you'd go in the

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:47.900
sea even yeah so you didn't go down for the whole summer no did you go to other beaches or yeah

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:49.360
yeah

00:24:52.140 --> 00:25:00.140
but not really you know it wasn't a it wasn't a beach summer for we just did other things and

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:11.900
but um didn't feel confident I mean my kids were five and seven yeah you know

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:16.140
I didn't really want to put them in a

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:25.980
in a situation that I didn't know enough to you know I didn't understand it I don't know how

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:33.580
long it takes to break down I don't know what it's made you know I had nothing really so I just

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:46.780
respond to situations with um caution well exactly yeah exactly and were you aware of um any kind of

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:57.900
health reaction no um but I remember where we lived um there were lots of trees all around the

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:07.740
house and we had a lot a lot of rook rooks at the front of the house and the back of the house which

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:13.500
was more towards the sea we had always lots of seagulls flying by and etc you know it was

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:21.180
rooks and seagulls you'd hear them all day all night well not all night but almost um they

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:28.780
the soundscape was very familiar of you know these big birds really lots of them

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:39.340
and they all they all disappeared they're you know all the birds um you didn't see any bird

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:50.140
flying anyway they all went inland um for quite a while because also they were spraying um

00:26:51.900 --> 00:27:00.300
some detergent or something or other um so there was quite a lot of that around as well as the

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:08.380
fumes and so yeah birds didn't didn't stick out the seagulls they were nowhere to be seen for ages

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:18.220
and um and even the rooks they they went in the forest and they came back but not for a while

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:25.020
and that was very obvious suddenly it was quite eerie because it was silent

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.020
there was a real hush you know that

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:39.420
even you know things like as a population of people there was that

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:45.900
that's hushing down that happens when people are in shock or when people are

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:49.900
upset or

00:27:52.540 --> 00:28:04.940
yeah and there were you know kind of patches of oil that people were careful to you know like all

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:09.900
the teams that were down on the beach cleaning and cleaning oh my god you know

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:17.900
no idea if it was right for people to be down there doing that like that but they did you know

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:30.300
people did i don't know what impact that had or would have or um and they were just in you know

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.820
wellies and and just cleaning

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:45.660
you know gathering buckets and big it was a massive undertaking from a lot of people who gave a lot of

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:54.700
time and effort and took a lot of risks um yeah and people were careful not to drag all that back

00:28:54.700 --> 00:29:01.420
into the streets but still you could see you could see oil here and then

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:10.860
and when you did your video did you have any press coverage of it

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:17.180
do you i had a call from a radio station i can't remember what

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.060
what

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:23.820
welsh radio bbc ways could have been sudden some

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.180
yeah yeah they ran me in the afternoon

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:32.640
and

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:42.620
and that was it really so they weren't aware of their presence during it no no i don't think they

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:50.700
were around and there were some photos in the paper

00:29:53.900 --> 00:30:00.940
i think the vigil there was only that one photo of emily and the amphibian in the paper and that was

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.260
uh

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:12.940
and i can't remember his name right now and his best one of any best friend's dad who took the

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:18.940
photo who works as a photographer for the local paper

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:27.740
i think there was as well as um a real kind of

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:30.220
um

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:42.860
sense of gratitude that we all felt towards each other for whoever turned up felt for everybody

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:52.460
else who turned up you know yeah there was a sense of comfort um but there was also

00:30:52.460 --> 00:31:02.380
so inevitably when everything goes well people are divided so there is no reason we should be

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:10.940
different yeah when things don't go well and so there were divisions that's you know showed

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:18.700
at those times um and i think maybe some people thought it was too

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:26.460
to uh you know it had to do with emotions and yeah it didn't sit that well with some people

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:31.900
i imagine who didn't come then i imagine and that was fine it is interesting because i've spoken to

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:40.620
quite a lot of people and the the difference of opinions and i can imagine that some people might

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:47.500
find they wouldn't want anything um negative you know it's all about oh we've got to be positive

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:52.700
we've got to get it all clean and get all our tourists back here and kind of shove it under

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:58.700
the carpet in a way yes not shove it under the carpet but just like get rid of the evidence and

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:08.860
and not have time for that yes sort of what might seem sentimental and yeah yeah after all they

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:17.580
might say there were no human deaths but it's not about that was it well no um

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:26.540
no it it wasn't about human death and that was what was so

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:37.260
you know a lot of people have experienced grief from having lost a person

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:45.100
but this was a grief about environment it was

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:49.900
identical in the sense of

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.460
identical in the sense of

00:32:54.780 --> 00:33:02.700
um shock and loss and the stages of grief and you know it was identical

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:14.140
and it was about all the creatures that have died like some people might feel or have felt you know

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:24.140
uh when we had all the curls that had to happen with the foot and mouth thing and yeah yeah all

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:33.020
of that you know and and the badger curl and you know all of that it it affects you when

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:42.300
when you look at a massive amount of creatures who end up dying at the same time you know whether

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:54.700
it's people or animals it's it has the power to move us in the same way

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.860
in the same way of course it's not the same but

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:09.580
it's in a way that is still very deep and

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:16.140
but it questions humanity doesn't it questions why we need to be doing these things

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:26.940
and and you know it gives people um markers like before the sea empress after the sea empress

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:33.340
where were you and the sea empress you know it's those those things they they

00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:41.020
suddenly they kind of put that date on the calendar and and there was the world before

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:49.260
and the world after and and that also is similar to grief yeah about other things because the

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:57.100
people are still really emotional about it now when we talk about it yeah a huge impact on

00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:13.420
people's lives it was that complete uh experience of what you hear about without really realizing

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:23.100
it's like before you have children and then you have children and then you understand and it was

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:32.460
that same thing suddenly we understood what it made what it meant well what everybody had been

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:38.300
on about we understood it and what it means to lose something really precious and what it meant

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:45.980
to have taken something so precious for granted that there was a real sense of

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:52.860
people were talking a lot about that about that having taken

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:57.820
things for granted

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:09.980
it our environment for granted not really ever conceiving that it could be taken away

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:17.020
and for us it was taken away and it was given back

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:18.380
um

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:30.060
i saw this program about joanna joanna lamley in japan and she goes to fukushima

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:40.860
and goes through the village that people left there and then thinking oh they'll be back in a

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:47.820
few days you know once the water kind of recedes and and they've never been back

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:51.980
that was taken away and that's not given back

00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:10.220
yeah for us we yeah based on the environment looked as if nothing had happened

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:21.100
which was really weird i can imagine that would be really strange it was and and we didn't trust it

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:31.100
a lot of people didn't trust it a lot of people did and but we've never really um and i suppose unless you are

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:42.140
a marine biologist and you're involved in doing that research

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:53.820
it's very hard to get information that you are going to trust these days you know and there

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:55.340
then and still now

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:03.980
if you heard one person it was like this if you heard another person it was like that

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:14.460
difficult to find out more than what we are being fed at that time it was a complete unknown

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:19.660
wasn't it because it hadn't really happened i mean for a lot of people for a lot of

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:25.980
biologists and scientists it was something that they just didn't know what was going to happen

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:34.460
well it had happened in other places but obviously but for people like the the

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:43.500
oriolton research center the the rock pools i don't think anyone knew how it would ever recover what

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:49.420
what the consequence consequences would be but and of course it was

00:38:51.580 --> 00:39:01.100
although people in situations like that already had access to internet and but

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:10.300
not everything was on internet like it is now so now if something like that happens you can find

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:18.620
information at an individual level you know people will just say oh but then it'll be all right i've

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:27.500
looked it up but yeah exactly um but certainly then people couldn't even do that people just had to

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:37.180
gather information from what was in the paper or on the radio or on tv or or if you knew somebody

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:45.180
who worked more closely with this that and the other and i remember i don't know how it happened

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:48.860
i was somewhere

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:58.940
um i might have been in um because i was teaching in bloomfield at the time

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:10.140
at the time i don't know where i met these people three um americans three men who

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:15.500
were they just flown from america

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:19.100
to offer

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:34.780
um to offer the rescue operation um some kind of are they called booms oh yeah the booms booms

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:44.940
um they had a system to do with that made from straw or something

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:45.740
or something

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:58.940
which they could um use to stop to stop the oil going you know people were actually

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:07.260
flying in coming in from different parts of the world who had already dealt with situations like

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:17.340
that in other places had products for sale and skills for sale you know and who were coming and

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:26.380
offering their services and um i remember i introduced them to friends of the earth we were

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:35.180
they turned up at one of the meetings and it was just a bit chaotic because you know

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:40.620
as often there was the sort of

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:51.580
official county council type of way of doing things and then there were groups like friends of the earth

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:55.900
who had different ideas

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:06.140
it certainly was a time when people gathered up for all sorts of reasons the vigil was

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:17.260
gathering up for reasons of sharing common emotions as opposed to experiencing them on your own

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:28.380
and then they were people who gathered up to look at other aspects of that same situation

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:38.060
and one of the things that came out of the sea empress disaster was that people became a lot

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:52.700
more engaged in wanting to know wanting to do something and at the time the the anti they had

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:55.900
been already an anti ore emulsion

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:03.340
faction that had already worked hard at

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:11.100
trying to get the population to fight against ore emulsion

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:21.260
and i don't know what would have happened if the sea empress disaster hadn't happened

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:31.980
maybe ore emulsion would have happened as it is after the sea empress

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:42.380
the sort of group that was fighting against ore emulsion coming into pembrokeshire

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:44.700
and then

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:53.980
took on a lot more importance and strength and there was a real campaign then that was well

00:43:55.820 --> 00:44:02.300
manned and organized and womaned and organized and was successfully

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:10.940
stopped ore emulsion being shipped in to

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:22.780
because that was another really scary thing that was happening at the time and so

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:34.220
you know we were just experiencing this oil slick knowing that we were under threat to have

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:46.060
something much more dangerous in terms of human lives then yeah because it had an explosive

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:51.500
aspect to it well didn't it so that

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:55.340
it puts

00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:06.700
you know a lot of communities at risk because the cloud of you know if there was to be a spill of

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:13.740
ore emulsion my understanding anyway at the time was that the cloud of

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:20.140
fumes could travel quite far inland and explode

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:32.060
so you know we were yeah it was a very scary time to to be seeing what was going on with

00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:39.180
an oil spill knowing that unless we did something we were

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:49.500
we were going to be at risk of something even more yeah so it's a a warning it was a warning

00:45:49.500 --> 00:46:00.060
but it was also really scary to to think that maybe we wouldn't be strong enough to oppose it and

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:09.020
and then we were you know it's one thing before thinking oh yeah it might happen and yeah we

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:19.580
don't want it and it's a bad thing and etc but not really taking on quite how scary it was how bad it was

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:25.580
so at the time it meant

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:30.380
it meant um yeah like a double

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:39.980
it served one you know it helped people to achieve that and to have a stronger voice i imagine and a

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:45.340
a bigger perspective isn't it yeah yeah

00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:57.500
so just one last thing do does it ever come up in conversation then has it been you know previous to

00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:06.060
to this um not for a long time not for a long time

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:12.300
accidentally

00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:20.620
yes so i don't know um

00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:34.860
um yeah i hadn't um thought about it much for a while and then came across that photograph

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:44.380
oh it was in the paper that's right the photo of emily and the amphibian was in the paper the 10b

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:52.780
time you know that thing where they look back on okay so this was recently yeah yeah not that long

00:47:52.780 --> 00:48:01.500
ago and so when he put that up in her kitchen and then so suddenly there it was and um we realized

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:12.300
it had been a while that we hadn't thought of that time or um i had um

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:20.140
a nice surprise at christmas um sort of christmas drinks

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:32.140
um with the the team that i the sort of wider team that i work with in herford west and emma who

00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:40.780
and emma who had been part of our little group that set up this um this project

00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:48.940
i hadn't seen emma for years and there she was she's a speech therapist so we work for the same

00:48:48.940 --> 00:49:00.540
inclusion team and that was nice to see each other um and when we do we know that

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:07.900
that that is the basis of our connection and that's quite a strong you know you go through

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:19.420
things like that with people and um and it yeah i haven't seen cara for a few years but um

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:26.060
our friendship is linked to that that time when we met under those circumstances

00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:33.580
circumstances and that was before abby asked you if you would oh yeah yeah yeah so and did you feel

00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:42.300
like you didn't maybe didn't want to or you're a bit like i don't no i i um i was quite taken by the

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:53.580
idea of your project you know the uh sort of looking back and seeing how things

00:49:53.980 --> 00:50:05.260
have been remembered um in fact i was talking with um somebody saying you know

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:16.060
how what's the life expectancy of sea creatures you know i know whales would remember something

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:27.100
that happened 20 years before and dolphins would and and then uh kai said to me lobsters

00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:35.980
live for many many years so they would have a memory of it because you know most of the

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:43.340
creatures who were affected by that or a lot i don't think they last for very long

00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:49.740
no it's funny to be able to tell their story when we when we had our walk and talk uh thing

00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:56.860
that abby organized the other day there were some limpets that did look quite old so i did try an

00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:03.580
interview yeah yeah but you know some of them because they can last many years so

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:08.860
we you know we were thinking were they around when it happened because obviously a lot of them died

00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:16.540
but then that's right and i don't you know i don't know i don't know um you hear about

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:24.620
whale songs and etc i don't know how a story gets told or transmitted

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:31.900
under the sea but it made me think of that when when abby told me about the project

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:40.140
concept isn't it i can tell my story of what happened 20 years ago and i was at an age where

00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:47.580
i can remember it my children and he could just about remember some things but not that much she

00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:54.060
was only five emily when i mentioned it to her she said oh yeah you know two years older and already

00:51:54.860 --> 00:52:04.380
you're a lot more you have access to memories but yeah i thought it was interesting because

00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:12.460
immediately triggered memories for me and and immediately made me think you know as humans we

00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:22.780
we keep our memories we we tell them we sing them we write them we paint them we do all sorts of

00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:31.260
things we store them and we pass them on as sea creatures i don't know or birds i don't know

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:38.860
what birds tell each other you know there's probably some skeptics out there that deny

00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:47.660
you deny it happened or something do you remember that time when we all flew we had to fly inland

00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:53.900
but yeah that's what it's a lot of them lost their ancestors that's right yes there's probably some

00:52:54.460 --> 00:53:03.260
it never happened it's you know and then you look at the the memory of water that's quite a it's

00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:11.020
supposed to be quite a minefield yeah of you know whether you believe it or not whether you i don't

00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:20.540
know anything about it except that it in my body it makes sense yeah you know in my way of looking

00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:29.900
at the world it makes sense that memories get stored in lots of ways in lots of things and in

00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:39.340
fact yeah all the geologists all the you know that they can see what gets stored so there is a memory

00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:49.260
other than ours of what happened there are there will definitely be traces of it won't they for sure

00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:56.140
yes yes i heard that in the

00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:05.020
is it in the haven or somewhere the the oil actually

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:15.660
the as of the tidal thing went into the estuary and sank in the mud and you can see it now it's

00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:25.660
created some sort of a bit like asphalt yeah all i know is that john who's doing the talk said that

00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:31.100
the last bit of oil to spill from the tanker was a completely different type of oil it's more like

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:40.780
a tar and there's a in bentless in handleton yeah there's like a they call it like the tar platform

00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:49.180
so it's like a pavement of tar yeah that's what she was saying yeah so they were definite i'm sure

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:58.620
there must be lots of places which have got traces of it somewhere i mean 20 years isn't even that

00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:07.900
much time really so yes it will be there and it will be there

00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:17.900
you know in the dunes in god knows where really but

00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:25.900
not disappeared it doesn't disappear not on the travel brochures not on the travel brochures

00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:32.380
and then people forgot it in terms of that you know yeah for a while

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:39.820
when you mention panbrookshire or you mentioned 10b people would say oh gosh yeah you've had that

00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:47.980
oil spill you know and now it's i've never i don't you know people never say something like that

00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:53.820
that and yes in terms of the

00:55:55.580 --> 00:56:05.260
tourists board and you know all the initiatives that took place to all the press all the

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:15.420
that really were behind all the cleaning effort they did well

00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:18.860
you know i think a lot of people did

00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:30.940
did well in making things get back to some sort of normality making things get back to

00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:39.340
some sort of functioning i wasn't sure myself about telling people that they could go in

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:49.660
the sea i wouldn't have done that myself i didn't go in myself people just were a bit

00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:55.740
i think hasty in saying that there was no problem there

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:07.180
but then certainly you had the livelihood of thousands of people that depended on that season

00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:13.420
people do what they've got to do to make sure

00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:17.420
in a way it was about damage limitation

00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:23.520
yeah

00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:31.180
right that's fantastic thank you
