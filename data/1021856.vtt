00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:32.120
Round his hound the breast, And well he barked me,

O come, and now be with me. O come, and now be with me.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:58.120

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:54.120
Away from danger, no prayer for a bed, The little Lord Jesus lay down His sweet head,

00:14:54.120 --> 00:15:10.120
The stars in the sky looked down where He lay, The little Lord Jesus a-sweet from the hay.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:26.120
The cattle I loathe in God, for baby wait, But with the Lord Jesus no crying be made,

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:43.120
I love thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky, And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:59.120
Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask thee to stay, Close by me forever, and love me, I pray,

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:19.120
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care, And take us to heaven to live with thee, O earth.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:28.120
And thou, little one, I think I ought to cry, When I'm present by thee, When I'm present by thee.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:58.120
Silent night, holy night, All is calm, all is bright, Round yon virgin, mother and child,

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:23.120
Holy infant so tender and mild, Sleep in heavenly peace, Sleep in heavenly peace.

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:40.120
Silent night, holy night, Shepherd's word so delight,

00:18:40.120 --> 00:19:05.120
Word resounding clear and long, Far and near the angels song, Christ the Savior is here,

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:13.120
Christ the Savior is here.
