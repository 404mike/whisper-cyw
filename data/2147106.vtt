00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The reason I was asking about the languages is if you're able to just introduce yourself with your name

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and where and when you were born in English and also in another one of your languages.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I don't know where my language will come in there.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
My name is Cordelia Ukusogwu.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I am Onora. That is my father's name, Onora.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And then my husband is Ukusogwu.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So that's the name.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm from Nigeria, the eastern part of Nigeria.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And from the region of the, I call Anambra state,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and from the area of the Igbo-speaking dialects.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And when were you born?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I was born on the 22nd of November 1944.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I was born as twins, identical twins.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And both of us as Haido, we grew up and...

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Are you able to say just your name and where you were born in the dialect?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
In one of your dialects?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
In my dialect?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Yeah.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Where I was born?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Yes, and your name and where you were born.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
My name is Cordelia Ukusogwu.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I was born in Omisha.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I speak in English.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You still speak in English.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Sorry, I shouldn't speak in English.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
No, just the introduction.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The introduction?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Yeah, just so you know.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Okay.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Well, I'm from Cordelia Ukusogwu.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I'm born the year 22nd November 1944.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Thank you.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And then of course, born in Anambra in Nigeria,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:44.000
which is part of Africa, West Africa, in the Commonwealth,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
one of the Commonwealth nations.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Do you remember the area that you grew up in?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Do you remember that area that you grew up in?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Oh yeah, of course.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
What was it like growing up there?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Well, my town is a cosmopolitan town, well populated and quite civilised.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And then it's quite a busy town and it contains one of the largest markets in West Africa.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Yeah, and that is the Omisha market.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Omisha market is quite near.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And the town is situated at the bank of the River Niger,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:06.000
where of course we have much of this Monk Park and the rest where they actually lived.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And even as of now, we still have that history of where they lived and how they operated

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and what they installed in my town, especially missionaries, the Irish missionaries,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
especially the Catholic and the Protestants.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Did you used to visit that as a child? Did you used to visit the coast and the waters?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course, my mother was a big trader and she was trading in fish,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:00.000
fish smoking and then she was doing the fish trading, a trader with the fishermen.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And I used to go to get the fish and everything.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And then my mum had a stall where she normally sells fish. So I know the area very well.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
What other things did you do as a child? What ages as well were you talking?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Oh, the age. Well, I will say I grew up in my town.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:40.000
By the time I started going to school, in primary school, my senior sister got married and then took me with her.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So I had to go to another state to live with her. So I wasn't living with my mum and dad.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I was living with my senior sister and I was schooling as well in another state, which is not my own state.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000
But I schooled partially as kindergarten and nursery and primary a little bit halfway.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Primary before I left my hometown to stay in another town with my sister.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And then I continued my schooling and then later on I came back home to stay with my mum and dad.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:34.000
My dad was a big fowl. Well, before I was born, my dad was a blacksmith in the town called Fokadous,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000
which is the French speaking area in the boat industry.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000
That's where he was a blacksmith in the boat industry in Fokadous.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And I don't know what his name is. It's one of the French countries. I don't know. I'll change his name by now.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:04.000
So at that time I wasn't born, but when my dad retired from that, he came home and became a farmer and a hunter.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:16.000
A farmer and hunter back home. And he was quite good with his farming.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And then eventually as a hunter, he killed a lion. And then because of that, he was hailed a hero.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
A big hero back home of a hunter killing a lion and everything.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000
So it was when we grew up that, you know, come to know that.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And apparently if you check with the year I was born, it was almost as post-World War II.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:54.000
I think 1944, post World War II. That was when I was born.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.000
So that's why I said, you know, I can remember that vividly.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And then I was called and my mom had so many of us, you know, because we were separated.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So I lived with my sister and then when I finished living with my sister, I lived with my aunt, my mother's sister's daughter.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And I lived with her as well. So I didn't grow completely from, you know, from childhood to whatever age.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000
But I was very close to my mom. So I lived with my aunt.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And then later on I came back home. Then it was when I came back home.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Then I finished my primary school. So I started to go into modern school.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
We had modern school then. It's a secondary school.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
At the beginning of secondary school, but we call it secondary modern school.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Yeah, so I did that. After that, then I went into nursing.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Okay.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
My nursing career.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
How old were you when you went into nursing?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000
I was about fifteen or sixteen. I went into nursing.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000
So what was your favorite memory of your childhood?

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Well, favorite memory of my childhood because I wasn't living in a sport.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
I was living with my sister and then with my auntie and then with my mom and dad.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And then before I left, I went to my nursing education, which I left home.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Because you have to be in a boarding school.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Yeah.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So my life as a child is so divided in that segment.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:14.000
So I wouldn't recall to say this is the time yet. But I lived here, lived here, lived here.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
So you wouldn't necessarily pick up moments in there that you would say is your favorite or most enjoyable?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Yeah, but I enjoyed my life, my time back home.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And I had a grandmother who was a staff member and supported me.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And then before I left home, finally.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:41.000
So what do you think about that childhood and that upbringing?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Is there one or two events that stick inside your mind or is there more in terms of just something special that might have happened?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Well, I wouldn't say because at that time, you know, young girls' children, you know, you help your mom to help.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
So my mom was still having children then.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:26.000
You help your mom to look after the baby and babies and everything and help out, you know, in sending messages, you know, that you can be able to cope with with your age.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:38.000
So I wouldn't say it was and I would say because I lived with my aunt and it was helping them when they have children.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:49.000
So I was there as a sort of assisting them, you know, like, instead of the.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
I don't know how to go about it.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:04.000
I won't say it's a nursery, but it's like somebody living with her senior sister and helping her out in helping with the baby, carrying the little ones.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And then, you know, sort of assisting the family child care.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Yeah, family child care.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
I enjoyed that so much.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And yeah, I would like to know about what it was like with your father after the lion as well.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
What was that? Did that change after you gained that status?

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Well, he did, because in my town, heroes are always welcome and they have a group of heroes.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
So every year they celebrate their heroism.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And they, you know, they wear regalia like, you know, that lion and then they do all their ceremonies, dancing, drumming and dancing.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
So we used to enjoy that.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And then my father being a big hunter, we enjoyed them.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Every day he goes out, he brings back, you know, where the beds are, you know, the beds are short.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And then we both hunt us using feeding their families, you know.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
So I enjoyed it.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And then my father was quite a materialist person.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
I mean, he's, you know, he's what he does.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And both from your father there and your mother, was there certain kind of values they were teaching you as well

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
that you carry now too?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
My mom was a businesswoman.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Businesswoman in the sense that, you know, in the moneys she helps us out, sort us out to go to school.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And then when we come back from school, my mom is in the market, in her shed where she's selling her goose.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:04.000
So we, sometimes we go to the market, you know, help her out and then come back to the house, to the home.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And we help our mom so much, you know.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
All of us are very close.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And the way my mom brought the girls up is the way she brought the boys' house passports.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
So we grew up as...

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:31.000
And fortunately, my mom was the second wife, not the first wife, because my dad had the first wife.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And then, you know, those days polygamy was, you know, quite polygamy in the sense of people marrying more than one wife.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
My father was the only son of his parents.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
So they said, well, because he's the first son, so he married.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
And then the first wife only had two or three children.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:03.000
They said, no, you know, because he's a big farmer, he has to have children to help him, you know, in the farm.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
So he married my mom.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
The first wife had about three children, but my mom had twelve.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Twelve children.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:23.000
So in those days, children matters a lot in those days, because they are the core of the family.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:35.000
The core is they help out in the farm, they help out in all the house responsibilities and cause of care.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:47.000
So how was that explained to you as well in terms of the multiple mothers too, with your father and then obviously your sisters, your brothers and sisters?

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Was that ever explained to you when you were younger?

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I think when we were growing up, we were living...

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
First we were living in our own house.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
My mom has her own room.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
The first wife had her own room.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
My dad had his own room.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And there's a common place in the house.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
So it's a polygamous one, but you never know.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:24.000
But the other children, by the time we grew up, the children of the first wife, they have already grown and they have married.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
And then they are the first two.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:37.000
My mother was more of the one taking care of my dad, looking after why the first wife is on her own, because her children has left home.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
So we were the younger ones in the family.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Because my mother had more.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:56.000
When you think you can't, you think it's only my mom that is the mother of the family, because we are more in the family than the other one.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:05.000
So we grew up together, in terms of like old siblings.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000
But there was no differentiation of, oh, you're not the son.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
It was so harmoniously.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.000
And then from that and growing up, how did you come into the UK?

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Yeah, my coming to the UK was when I finished my nursing.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
I finished my nursing career with midwifery and nursing.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:46.000
And I've been working, even during the war in my country, that three years, I was working as a nurse during that wartime.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
And it was really hectic. And I was working more in the war front.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Yeah, because there was a hospital that we were based.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:04.000
So we are treating wounded soldiers and taking care of, you know,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:17.000
wounded soldiers. And then, of course, we have our, you know, war effects, you know, where we have to go to the bunker when there is attack and everything.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:25.000
We stay in the bunker. So then we take our patients into the bunkers and we take them out when there is no attack.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000
We're nursing the patients there, the soldiers.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
What year was this and how old were you as well?

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:47.000
I finished my nursing and midwifery because that was 1960, end of 66 to 67. That was when the war started.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
So like 23?

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Yeah, about 27 years. And then the war finished in three years.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Okay.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:08.000
And then my two brothers were here in the UK. Then my senior brothers, they were here from my own mom. They were already here.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:17.000
So when one of them had children and their children, once they have their children, they send them back home.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:29.000
And, you know, they were looked after back home. So during the war, they lived with me where I was working during the war for their own safety,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:37.000
for the safety of the children. So I took care of them. And then during the war, we had some, you know, we called them characters.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:48.000
You know, these international aid workers. They supply food and then we distribute.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:20:00.000
And I was, as a midwife then, I was taking care of them. I was doing much of child and health, mother and child health care.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:14.000
You know, as a midwife, you know, giving vaccinations, treating children, babies and their mothers, pregnant mothers and everything.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:29.000
So during that time, those children, I was able to send them back to their parents here through the characters, the characters international aid organization.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:44.000
So that was, the war ended. So when the war ended, I said to my mom and my brothers that are here that I want to come over

00:20:44.000 --> 00:21:00.000
to at least to sort of get relief from the effect of the war and for me to improve my work and continue to pursue my nursing career as well.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
As soon as I came here, I did that as well.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
What expectations do you have of the UK?

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Of coming.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
And where was it? Where was your first place you came to the UK?

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:23.000
I came to the UK and in London. I lived in London with my brother, my single brother.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Because that's where I, you know, because he was the one that invited me to come. So I came, I lived with him and the family.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:40.000
And that was in East London. East London, yeah, Matonstone.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
What were your expectations on London before you came?

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Unfortunately, I came at the time when it was real winter.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Did you know it was going to be winter?

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:06.000
I know, I know. I came when it was really bad. I came with Lufthansa, is it Lufthansa flight and I landed in the bedroom.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:13.000
And I didn't know a thing. Fortunately, my brother and his wife, they were at work.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:22.000
So they told me to call them when I get to the airport. So at the airport, I gave them the number and then they called them.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:29.000
I spoke to them that I'm now in Heathrow. So they said I should wait there. When they finished work, they would come down to collect me.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:44.000
So that was how I got myself. So I had people to take care of me when I came in. My brother and wife. And I lived with them.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
But it was really cold.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Then my brother was, they were living in Lettuce and they say the hospital was very close to where they lived.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:06.000
So I just walked to the hospital to say I'm a nurse. I'm a registered nurse back home. I'm a midwife.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:19.000
So they said, okay, they will take me as a nurse. They will take me as a carer, care assistant. I said, okay, that is the rule.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:40.000
So I was taken as a carer. And then from the way I was doing my work as a professional qualified, they saw I was really quite good in what I'm doing.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:50.000
So there were things that, for example, when the doctors or nurses are working, I always like to be there with them.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:58.000
And then I will ask questions. Especially during doctor's rounds. And they will ask questions. And then the students, they will know it.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.000
And then they will say, has anybody got an idea? And I will raise my hand up and I will answer.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:14.000
And then they say, did you say this is a care assistant? And that was how I managed it.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:25.000
They gave me some very tricky assignments to do. Taking the temperature, doing blood pressure, doing all those things that nurses do.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:43.000
And I was recruited as a care assistant. So when I did all this, they felt, especially the doctors, they felt, oh no, this is somebody that knows what she's doing.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:58.000
So they were the ones that helped me out. The organization, the hospital. Then they sent my name to the NMC, that is the Nussela Mipi Free Council.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:08.000
So that they will now recognize my certificates and they'll see what course they can now send me to do. Adaptation course.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:18.000
They sent me to do. So they asked me, do you want to practice the Nussela Mipi? I said, it's made with me. It's made with me, I prefer.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:26.000
So made with me, they can take you to work if you haven't got the myceliary experience.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:39.000
And if for you to have that myceliary experience, you have to do six months course. And then you'll be subjected to do the myceliary under supervision.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:51.000
So I have to do one year training, first six months and the second six months. At the first six months, I took an exam.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:08.000
And then I got through and then did the second one. But unfortunately for me, before I started the training, I got married.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's in London. I got married. So I was able to do the first six months. Then I went to have my baby.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:29.000
After having my baby, I went back again to do the second one. So I was after I qualified then I was recognized to practice as a midwife.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Then in the process of the hospital doing all that and I finished, then they now wrote to the NMC, the Nussela Midwifery Council, that being that I've done very well, that they should now recognize my still have training.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:58.000
So that's what I did. So I was recognized and they gave me my certificate to practice both Nussela Midwifery.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:11.000
So that's how I was. I had my first child and then I think after three years, I had the second one.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Yeah, and my husband was still a student then because he was studying accountancy, ACCA. So I was a student, he was a student as well.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:48.000
So we all worked together and then he qualified as a midwife and accountant. Then from there I did all the other, you know, many other trainings like family planning, clinical instructors course.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:28:06.000
And later on I was given an admission to go and do tutorial, tutorial to be a lecturer in Nussela Midwifery. So I got the admission in Sitco Hospital in Kent.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:20.000
But unfortunately my husband left, has left UK to go home because he was the first son of his dad and his dad was very ill.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:37.000
So he went home and left me and the children here so I couldn't do the course, the tutorial. So I was working, working as a midwife.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:53.000
And then when he finished, he qualified, he left and then I went back again with my children, back to Nigeria. Yeah, I went back to Nigeria with my husband and my children.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Then I have to now work. Then I was with my clinical instructors course that I did. I have to be a clinical instructor back home, teaching in the Lawson School.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:22.000
And then later on I went to do my diploma back home. To do that training that I'm supposed to do here, I have to do it back home in the uni.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:44.000
So I was a lecturer throughout in the School of Nursing. Yeah, and then I worked for a long time here. I worked about six years before we went back home.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:30:04.000
And then after six years, I spent about 20 years back home as a lecturer and then I came back again. And then I came back here again and then I continued doing so.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:19.000
So I started from cradle and then when I came here, they wanted me to continue here to lecture. I said, I've had enough of lecturing. So I decided to go to old people's home.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:36.000
And then that's where I switched over to end of life that is old care. So that training I didn't go there. When I went back home, I went to the university to do that training.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:31:04.000
And that qualified me to be teaching as a lecturer in the School of Midwifery and Nursing. And then after five, after about ten years of that training, I have to go in for in-service training in the university again to do a diploma in advanced administration.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:16.000
So to be a director, assistant director of nursing. So that was where I started.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Wow.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Yeah, so when I finished there now, I had my niece, all my children have grown now. They've all gone to university. So my husband had his accounting firm and working as a director in his own firm.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:58.000
So that was he was doing that and I was teaching as well. So we had but we lived in the north, in the northern part of Nigeria, not in my state.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Okay.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Open the notes, right? So when when when did Newport come into the equation because you're living in London up until your qualifications and then going back home.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
So when did you when the Newport come in?

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Yeah, the Newport came in when I finished, I would say, in the north because I'm a Christian and I didn't come from the north because I have done all those courses and I'm qualified to be a director in the nursing.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:33:12.000
So they said no, because I'm not an indigent, I should go back to my state. So I was disrupted from my service. It's sort of forced, forced retirement to say because I'm a Christian, I'm not a Muslim.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:32.000
So I was sent back to my state. But that aspect, I finished my university administration, administrative course. Because when I come back after the training, I will be promoted to director.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:53.000
So they said no, because we are not from that state. They won't give me that. So I was retired immediately. And when they retired me, of course, my children, they are all in the university. My husband still has his job.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:15.000
So my niece had an accident and had an operation and it was so he had some surgery to be done, which they couldn't do. So I was able to and she usually she usually comes here on holidays and go back.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:33.000
So and then she just got the if it's a to come on holidays when she had the accident. So I have to now accompany her for treatment here. And then I came back with her.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:47.000
And when I came back after her treatment, she now left and I stayed back in my in my brother's house in my second brother's house, because the first one I stayed with passed away.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Yeah, I stay with when he came home and the wife, the wife and children that's here in Bournemouth. So my second brother was here. He's still here. So I have to come back with my niece and we stayed with my brother.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:30.000
So when she now got recovered, she went back. I stayed back. So I stayed back in London and I was working in London. So as I was working in London, I felt London is too hectic.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:51.000
I was there working. So I decided I said I want to live London. So there was an agency I met and then they gave me they gave me a job in Bristol.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:36:09.000
And when I went to Bristol, the the home they got for me, they said they don't have a vacancy for registered nurse. They only want care assistants.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:23.000
But I said to them I qualified in this country so I cannot go back and start doing care. This is my first time. So they found me and then they now brought me to their home here in Newport.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Instead of me staying in Bristol, they brought me to Newport to work. And that's how I've been in Newport because Newport is quiet and it's just what I wanted to continue.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:57.000
So my career was my my utmost pursuit to everything I was doing right from home and here. So my career was the sort of bedrock for me and it's the masterpiece for me as well.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:05.000
And that's what I've continued to do until date.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000
What year is this as well? In Newport?

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:32.000
In Newport. When I came to Newport it was, I came in in September 1999. But I started working here in Newport 2000, the year 2000.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
That's when I started working in Newport.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:45.000
And what do you remember or recall about the first kind of months that you were inside of Newport? Because you said it was quiet.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:38:02.000
Yeah, it was quiet. It's not because I grew up in a town that is a hostel, busy town. The night I lived was another busy in Karno, right up, very busy, hectic town.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:12.000
So I've been living in townships, very busy places. And I came back here and I lived in London and it was too much for me.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:27.000
You go to work in the morning, by the time you finish work and get home, and then you can't have enough sleep. Only four hours or less and six hours sleep you're going back to work again.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:41.000
So I felt it would take a big toll on me. So I decided I left my brother. I found my way here. My brother said to me, how can you go to Newport when you don't know anybody?

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:53.000
I said, but people are living there. But fortunately the people that gave me the job, they assisted me, got a place for me, the flats.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:08.000
They were able to house me and help me to settle down in the accommodation and everything. If I was able to live on my own I would start doing things on my own.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:31.000
But I think, as I said, that nursing was my bedrock and my masterpiece. It pulled me through. And then of course my progress was also boosted by my own, the way I took nursing and the way I mastered it up to that level.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:47.000
So I think that was why I was taking the jobs like that. My profession was what really elated me and then put me into this job.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Do you feel like there were any challenges as well then? Coming to Newport and then leaving after that?

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:14.000
The challenges are the same because of colour. You don't get anything so good if you're not an indigene of any place.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:34.000
I was treated as a non-indigene in my own country. That was my sad experience. And when I came here, that treatment they gave me didn't measure as much as what I was given in my own country when I was retired.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:41.000
I was treated as an indigene instantly because I'm not an indigene of that place. You understand?

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:56.000
When I came here, that level of experience I had, it was nothing to me here. Whatever they were doing, just because of my experience, I ignored them.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:05.000
I just faced my work, did my own thing and that's it. I kept my own pace, my own space and that's it.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:16.000
So, when that abuse was there, I didn't want to take it because I've taken a heavier one, which I never expected.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:30.000
Because of my religion and because of my dialect, I wasn't given the job I was supposed to be given and I was laid off because of that.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:47.000
So, coming to a strange place, there's nothing they can do for me that can weigh to that experience. And that is what really gave me the strong man to withstand the abuse.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:42:01.000
That makes sense. It's that resilience. I think you already spoke about alien run anyway, that you were learning from the household and your environment about being able to persevere and pass through.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:09.000
And then as you've shared as well, gone through your work and you've been qualified and all of that upskilling, it showed your resilience.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Did any of your friends join here in Newport or family or was it a visit?

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:34.000
I had a friend that lived in London. So, she had a friend who came all the way from Nigeria and was looking for a place.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:49.000
So, that's my friend. I sent her to me to help her to find a job here. So, fortunately, we were able to take her. So, we were living together.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Yeah, yeah. So, we lived together and then we did things commonly. But when I was living here, I was on my own. So, I normally go weekends to my brothers in London to stay with them.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:16.000
So, they were my closest friends and family that I had.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
What do you miss most about your country? What about Nigeria?

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:40.000
My relatives, my siblings, my siblings and then of course, the life there too. It's quite easy. Even though it's busy, it's quite easy to live in your own country.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Because a place that hasn't got a lot of that like here, you live at your own little space. As long as you know what you're doing and you have something in your hand that is in terms of profession or work.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:18.000
So, you fit in anywhere. And the profession I had, I said, you fit in anywhere you go. You fit in anywhere you go and it's the same. So, that was what really made me to adjust to this country.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000
So, that's what you would say you love the most as well or say something else you'd say you love the most?

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000
I don't.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Is that what you would also say that you love the most about your country?

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000
My country?

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Yeah.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It is because my twin sister was there. So, I usually go home every year. I go home every year to see my twin sister, my older sister and then my children, two were there and two were here.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:45:11.000
The two I had here, the girl got married, you know, lived in South Africa with the husband. They have been, you know, living in the Arab country working because the husband is working in the oil sector.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:28.000
And the other two, they are twins. I have twins, the boy and the girl. So, the two of them, they were back home. I have to bring them here to do their postgraduate course. So, they came and lived with me.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:41.000
The postgraduate, the girl got married, went back home. Then the boy said he's not staying, he has to go home and stay with his sister. So, both of them stayed there.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Now, the boy is back here again with the wife. They are staying with me since I lost my husband. So, we are just, you know, and then my eldest daughter is here as well.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:14.000
She's living with her children, but her two boys, they just left home now. They've got their jobs and they are all out. One did the biophysics like the father and then the other one did the cyber computer.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:23.000
So, they are all working in their respective jobs. The other one is there now. He's working in the region.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:36.000
We are going back from Scotland and the high seas there, so that's where he goes. And the other one is here, he's a cyber computer taster.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:54.000
It sounds as if, as you speak, it sounds as if you have naturally preserved your culture. And it sounds, because you are, like you said, seeing your sister go in there, your children go in there, it maintains that connection.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:07.000
Is there other elements that you would say that you have made an effort to make sure that you are remembering the clans, remembering where you come from, remembering the traditions and things like that?

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:21.000
I do, I do, because my senior sister and my twin sister, they kept me updated and they kept on saying, I go home now, spend my holidays, come back.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Then my twin sister also comes and goes as well, but I lost her six months ago. So, I have always kept that tradition. I even had a title back home.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Title, yeah, chieftaincy title back home. I'm much over there and much over here as well.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Wow, strong reflection, strong reflection of you of course.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:18.000
We have an organization, my people back home, we have our meetings here in London, our organization here, so we do have meetings in London. So, we still keep to our tradition.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Why, why, why do you do that? Why?

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000
Why?

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:36.000
Why? Yeah, so that I will still be remembering home. I will still have connection of my roots. Yeah, I still have to. Yeah, I still have to.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Yeah, because my siblings are there, so I still have to be connected. I know I'm a citizen here, I'm a British citizen, and I'm also in Nigeria, but my roots, I don't want to let go or leave it. That's why I go home and come back from time to time.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:13.000
And also, in this section, why is that important for the children, the next generation? Why is that also important?

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Why is that important?

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000
Yeah, why? How and why?

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Yeah, it should be because parents need to, to, you know, sort of bond their children with their children, and the bonding is not only just, oh yes, we are, you know, mother and child also. We must also make the child to know that this is their roots, where they come from.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:50:09.000
And most of my children, and even all my grandchildren, they move back home. They bring home and come back. When we go on holidays, we take them and bring them back. So they all know, the grandchildren, especially my children, when I took them home, and they, the school that home, they did their university, their first degrees over there, and then they still come here to do their post-graduates.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Yeah, so they have the same roots I channeled them to. So they have the roots and they have their education.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:39.000
Yeah, thank you. Thank you so much for sharing all of this as well. Really, really appreciate it. Just hearing about it. Where does Age Alive come into, when, when, when it's in your timeline, when they come?

00:50:39.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Yeah, Age Alive is, you know, I will say, Age Alive comes, you know, I belong to the church, St. Mary's Church, where Age Alive do have their activities. So because I am a member of that church, and they are, you know, volunteering that church, I happen to see them doing the activities in our

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:32.000
institute. So that's how I wanted to say, okay, and then I was living alone here. My husband was back home. So I would say it's loneliness, but interaction with people. And that's how I joined Age Alive.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Yeah, to interact with different people.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:41.000
And what has been your involvement, your individual involvement as well as anything that you do specific to?

00:51:41.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Yeah, Age Alive, I've been with them since 2000, I don't remember. I joined them in 2005 or 2006 or so. I can't remember, but we did that together.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:30.000
Yeah, and I've been joining them in everything they do, taking part in everything. They are present, you know, well, because of the way I've been active with them, and I've been, I've been long with them as well. So I'm one of the members of the committee. That is Age Alive.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000
What does Age Alive mean to you today?

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:57.000
Age Alive, what it means to me is that it has actually helped me to sort of mix with different, you know, different people from different backgrounds. And then to know different background of people.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:20.000
I would say, especially with their religious cremations, when I lived in the North, I lived with the Muslims. So when I came and I saw they are Muslims as well, so the knowledge I have about the Muslims and the way I've lived with them is just always the same.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:39.000
So whatever they do, I can tolerate it because I've tolerated from the root, from my roots. I have tolerated and I've been with them and I lived in the same compound with them because I lived in the school quarters where the school is, you know.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:54:06.000
And I was given my own house there in the school and I was, I was a vice principal and I was, I paid so much role in the administrative work in terms of staff management, you know, organizations and examinations, national examinations and so many things.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:33.000
So that's why I was able to get them in as much as joining them. When I joined, the level of the people I met there wasn't what I expected, but at least you have met people, you have to interact with people regardless of their status.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:46.000
We are still a human being like them. So I didn't want to say no more because I'm, you know, I'm this I have, I won't go there. So I was able to, you know, remain there.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:55:06.000
I find it a quiet, friendly, caring and very transparent human being as I can say. So they are quiet, you know. For me, I don't like crowded places.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:14.000
And I know I choose my friends. I choose my friends. I don't go out anyhow.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:26.000
Makes sense, makes sense. You're talking about places. Is there, is there one place in your time of your age of life that comes straight into your head when you think about age of life?

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:46.000
Well, the reason why, you know, I mean, I have, I, well, we like things because I've met people of my own age there. I know many people who are of the same age, age mates.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:56:01.000
And they are one or two. They are also in my profession. So when you see people of the same, you know, caliber that you are, then you fit in as well.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:17.000
And that made me to, you know, feel that these are the people and all of us are foreigners. So you gain from them because when you tolerate them, you gain.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:40.000
You gain from them and because most of them, some of them were born here and some of them have lived for about 50 years here. So it's a medium of, you know, good interaction and experiences and knowledge as well.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:59.000
I agree. I agree. Just on the closing section now, just to bring this slightly back onto the family. Is there any family heirlooms or ornaments that you have kept? Are there any kind of family ornaments or heirlooms?

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:07.000
Not quite. You mean that like, example?

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:17.000
It could be photographs. Important things are important. It could be photographs or if there was an emblem or a medal or something like that or a description.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:34.000
Unfortunately, as I said, most of my childhood rough bringing and when I was doing my nursing and everything, I lost most of them during the war.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:55.000
The war in my country because I did not bring anything out from there at all. My childhood, everything, you know, it's not there. It's not there. Whatever I have is what I've been taking from, you know, as I go along.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:18.000
Well, it's only in my traditional pictures that I have when I took the title back home. That's the only thing I have. I can say, you know, because that was after the war and I've been here and then went back home to the side. So that's the only thing I can say I have.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:24.000
But childhood and I lost most of them during the war.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:34.000
Okay. Well, thank you. Thank you very much for sharing absolutely everything you have and to hear your incredible story.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:49.000
Well, you give your stories of how you find yourself and how you've been carrying yourself all these years.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:59:14.000
Well, I think the major basis, the foundation, the foundation is what makes people what they are. Foundation and then the upbringing and then your voyage, the voyage you have moved. So these are the things that make the life of everybody.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:17.000
So that's why it is.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:25.000
And I've met, I have, I've met so many friends from your place.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:31.000
I have some background friends as well.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:34.000
Agnes Whitman.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:41.000
I have a friend who is a game, Motali Small.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.000
Robert Small.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:51.000
Robert Small, I think I've, he must have come at the same time when I came down to Newport.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:58.000
Because I always meet him, you know, he was the first black person I was meeting when I first came to Newport.

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000
I met him, you know, we pass and say hello at that time, you know.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
So these days he says, how you're still there? I said yes, yes.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:16.000
And then one Brian, Brian, he's in Cardiff.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Okay, used to be, used to be in Newport.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Yeah, no, he was, I joined the retired elders in Cardiff.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Then I told him about 50 plus, so he was coming from Cardiff to join us.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Yeah, he says in Birmingham.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Yeah, because of transportation and everything, he said it's too much for him.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
So he doesn't come again.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:51.000
So we meet in the Cardiff group, elders group, because I belong to different groups.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
50 plus, elders group.
