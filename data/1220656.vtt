00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
How did your football career progress then after not being the goalie for Merthyr?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Fine. Played for the school team in Cantonian.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Also played for the rugby team as well the first fifteen.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But I reckon it was because when I was seventeen I was the only one who had a car.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So rather than pick somebody else and have to get everybody over there on a bus,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
they took advantage of me being able to ferry because rugby wasn't my sport.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
But I ended up playing for Cardiff Schools as a goalkeeper apart from the school team.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And you played for the Maccabees as well?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Yes, I was fortunate enough to play for Great Britain Maccabee as well in various tournaments,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
be them in London, Brussels.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Can you tell me about the Maccabee team in Cardiff then?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Yes, we had a Maccabee team.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I used to play on a Sunday in the Sunday league.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
No, I think originally played just friendlies.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And then had the opportunity of participating in the Maccabee league in London,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
which was very onerous. It was the days before the M4 was built.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And every fortnight we would go up to London and play in very good places like Hackney Marshes.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Very joyous. But they were great, great fun.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And that lasted for about four or five years.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
How did you get to London?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
On a coach, on a coach.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And it wasn't just London, there was a team south end and Brighton were in it as well.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So it was quite a long day to say the least. But great fun.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And you were just playing on Sundays?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Yes, very much so. Just on Sunday.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Did you have a professional manager at that time?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Oh yes. All different ones. Cardiff City players. Quite a number, well known at the time.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
There was a guy called Ronnie Bird, a very good favourite of the Jewish community.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Steve Derrott, who ended up playing for Wales.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
A guy called Roger Hoy.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.000
We ensured that if we had a coach, he had to be one of the professionals at Cardiff.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Do you know how Maccabi's club was run? Who organised it, who ran it?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Well in the end, me to a certain extent.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
But initially when I played, I was one of the youngest playing.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And we had a Jewish manager, Leslie Feldman, apart from the coaches.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
We didn't have any club premises as such.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So it was all phone calls or meetings in people's houses.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:17.000
But it ran and it was on a shoestring. But good fun.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I've seen the minutes when a Maccabi club, there was a reference in there to an altercation between a manager and a referee.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Apparently so, yes.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Were you around at that time?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Vaguely.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I was on the outside at the time, I think it was only 14 or 15.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So I was a little bit young to be involved with it.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
But what I do remember is that his behaviour wasn't acceptable.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And he was sacked from being our manager, which considering he wasn't paid, it was a bit of a financial loss to him.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:09.000
On another theme, on a personal basis, what interesting happened with me was we had this one manager, Ronnie Byrd, who played for what was known as the charity team made up of exporting people.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And on one Sunday morning we're playing a local Maccabi game now in the local Sunday league.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:29.000
He had to go off because he's playing this football match against, I'm not quite sure, anyway he was playing for this, ex-professionals etc.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And when I got home from playing our game, my wife told me there was a phone call from Ronnie, they needed a goalkeeper, would I go and help out?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:52.000
So I went down to this local private pitch and there were people there like Barry John and Gareth Edwards, ex-Wales rugby internationals.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And I was asked to play with them.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I can remember the match was kicked off by a girl called Helen Morgan who had previous year been from Pernaf who was the current Miss World, although she got sacked from it because it transpired.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
She was an unmarried mother and that went against the rules.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
But following from that, I regularly played for a couple of years while this team still existed.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I was the non-famous one who engulfed for them playing with people like Gareth Edwards, Tommy David, Barry John, Lyn Davies, Lyn O'Leep.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000
It was a wonderful experience but highly embarrassing when people would walk up to me and say, can I have your autograph, who are you?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
But that was the highlight of my football career.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And that was charity matches.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Very much so, yes.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Tell me about how you got to play for the National Maccabee team.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:07.000
We played in the Maccabee League and we had a particular Maccabee Cup game one year where we played a team called NAL, Maccabee Association of London, from London.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
We played them in Cardiff.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Their manager happened to be the manager of the National Maccabee team, a guy called Barnett, John Barnett.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Although we lost 5-1 in Maccabee, I also played outfield.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
I was a defender as well, apart from a goalkeeper.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
I was playing centre half that day and he saw me.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:44.000
He had me selected for the national team, which was a great honour and great fun.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:58.000
In fact it was quite unique because the first international tournament we went to in Brussels, the team was made up of MAL players, his team and Scottish players in the main, and me as well.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
So that was good.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Who would they play then, the national team? They were playing competitions?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Yes, we played that European tournament. In fact one year we won it, playing teams from all over Europe.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
The other Jewish teams?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Oh very much so, yes.
