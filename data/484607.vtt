Interviewer Steve Fletcher. Venue Swicker Office.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The date Friday 14th November 2015.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Interviewee Prithpal Biant.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Prithpal, would you be kind enough to spell your name for us and posterity?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Yes, first name Prithpal, P-R-I-T-H-P-A-L.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Surname's Biant, B-I-A-N-T.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Thank you very much indeed.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So, can you remember when you first came into contact with Swicker?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Yes. Well, I just got my first job after leaving university and it was at the Race and Equality Council.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And I was the Welfare Rights Officer actually, nothing to do with the arts,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
but I think I must have said I had an interest in arts because I was always a bit,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
anyway, I used to do a bit of arts in my own time.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So they said, oh, we've got this festival thing that we're doing and, you know, we're in touch with Steve.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Why don't you go and, you know, see if he can help you put together the Multicultural Arts Festival,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
which is one of the things I wanted to do.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So it started with that and then the REC needed a rep.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Well, you invited a rep from the REC to your board, so they picked me to be the rep.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So then I think I was probably on your board for, I don't know, probably at least two, maybe three years.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
No, I can remember you being there. What's your overriding or your general recollections?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
What was it like to be on an early Swicker board? Be honest.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
OK. Well, I just remember sitting there and you had lots of people,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
different people from different funding bodies like the Arts Council, Local Council and different people with different pots of money.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And I do remember it being a bit of a struggle. It wasn't like a positive experience.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And I remember looking back, feeling quite sorry for you, having to defend yourself on every little point you were trying to do.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And, yeah, it wasn't positive. And I don't think anyone was really supporting you and saying, oh, isn't it great that you're doing this?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It was more like, you know, why are you doing it? More than we're really glad you're doing it, which is bizarre, isn't it?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
When you look back, considering how much colour and, you know, life it provides to the city.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So I think I just remember thinking, God, what a struggle it was.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And just the arts council, well, not well, you know, the funding bodies try to sort of sometimes compete and fight against each other.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And it was almost like if one would fund you, then the other would say, well, we won't bother them.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
But actually, they were all on your board. But it wasn't really supportive or positive.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I don't think so. I thought that's why if you're looking back and not that we are not young and vibrant at heart, but as young and vibrant people,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
do we have any ideological differences?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Oh, well, I think, yeah, well, I suppose there was there was this thing.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I remember me used to have discussions about multiculturalism versus interculturalism, which was stupid because we're all on the same side.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
But I think maybe because we were all we were all fighting for money.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So in the voluntary sector, because my organisation was, you know, involved sector as well.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So, you know, from the funders point of view, if you were doing anything minority, then they'd take their box.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So they probably only want to fund one body. So why would they want to fund two things?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
They wouldn't want to be duplicatory. That would be a crime.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Exactly. Yeah. So I think that so whereas the the Multicultural Arts Festival, I was coordinated a few years before we set up.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
That was all about celebrating different cultures in a way, keeping cultures alive because there's so many different minority communities.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And part of the REC's role was about saying, you know, let's be positive about the minority communities.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So that was my role. And then I suppose intercultural was slightly different.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And that was about everybody sharing.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
But also, and I don't know whether if I was totally honest, I don't know, sometimes you think you're diluting and it sounds awful.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
It's like something my parents would probably think, you know, just pathetic.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
But it's rather than celebrating, it's almost like, you know, people want this.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
There's the Preservist Camp, isn't there? Yeah. And let's celebrate what exists now.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Or even tradition versus innovation.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Tradition versus fusion. Yes. Exactly. You were more fusion, weren't you? Yes.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And I sort of nobody owned anything. It was all up for grabs.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Let's just let's all make it into a complete mess.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Yeah. Well, I was thinking, you know, it's good to know what Bengali people did with all their chalky street art stuff.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
They're still close to my heart.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Yeah. And I used to love that. Or, you know, all the different ones.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And I thought, but really there was a place for everything. Yes.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
But I think the environment was such that, you know, you could only have one of something that was minority, which is just ridiculous.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So and I think that there was some friction. It was just I just remember discussions, which I think were silly.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I don't think you ever hit me, did you?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I don't think so. I suspect I was probably right. You were probably bigger than me.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I was probably right anyway.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Yeah. So I remember that.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And then Cardiff Carnival. Yes. How? Please tell us your Cardiff Carnival story.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Yes. So as well as being on the board, I did actually take part outside of work. So nothing to do with work.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Yeah. I was I was doing a life drawing class at Chapter.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Minding your own business.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Yeah. So I was turning up there and it was like in the morning, 10 till 12, I think.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Then either I'd finished or I was late or something.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
But I saw you guys in Chapter and you were all dressed in a point.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
I was thinking, well, that looks good fun.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And you just said to me, well, you can do it as well if you want. You can take part.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
So I remember just I had colorful leggings on and trainers.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
All I did was maybe just I just hooked this costume on.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
So I it's like a backpack thing. So I'd straps on my shoulders.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Then I had these gorgeous what I think were like peacock type feathers.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So and I think all you did was just paint my face a bit white.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And I just tackled along really.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And I was dancing down from Chapter all the way through Canton, I think.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
We went down Canton High Street. And I remember dancing around St. Mary Street.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I can't remember exactly what the finale was, but I just remember thinking, does anybody know who I am?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And I didn't mind because I was all dressed up.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Did anybody identify you or not? Because there's anonymity in Carnival.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
But particularly if you have a lot of people who are in a section which resemble each other.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
I mean, very hard to spot individuals, even if they're members of your family, I find.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I felt as if nobody knew it was me. You're in disguise.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I was definitely I put all my face with all white stuff on it.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And I had these peacock feathers, which I don't normally wear.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And they were pretty big. And I was dancing on the street and I wasn't drunk or anything.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And it was daylight. So I didn't think anyone recognized me.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
So it was really it was a really good experience, actually.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And it was just really fun. And it was totally unexpected. Yeah.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Because I think that's so I think that's probably the most spontaneous example of Carnival participation

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
I've heard since collecting this story, which is wonderful.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Yeah, I'm not very good at planning things. I'm more.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Yeah. So sometimes the interesting things happen to you when you don't plan.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Absolutely out of the blue. Yeah. So we did that. So that was quite cool.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
So I was part of it. I wish I'd done it more. But, you know, then you get life and as I say,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
children, family intervenes and children go, I don't want to go.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And you think, OK, just quite right.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Yes. Anyway, but you've been going and you've got all this stuff now.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Yes. Five years, a quarter of a century or what I accidentally did with my life, as the project's name.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And is it better now? Are the board meetings better?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
By and large, yes. Yes. Yes.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Yes. The board are certainly they do what they can. Bless them.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I also remember you every year on year, you were struggling for survival.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And you were always trying to trying to get three year funding, but they wouldn't give it to you.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Yes. Yes. So hopefully that's changed.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And that's all gone the other way. So we achieved all that.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And in terms of funding, our hailsing days were probably at the points at which the Arts Council were offering three year funding packages.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
The lottery was actually generating large amounts of money.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.000
But so in terms of funding, the hailsing days, certainly for Carnival, were probably 10 years ago.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And so at the moment, for example, the local authority offers no revenue or project support for the Carnival or for Swickr or any projects in the city.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And that's done for two years. I mean, they pay you when you do this.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And they do the first thing. No reverse. We have to raise all the money and give them money to even parade on our own streets.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
It's got worse and worse and worse. You add to the diversity in the cultural.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
If you were in charge of it, we would have a problem.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Would we? So when they say with the cap of the greatest city in Europe or whatever, the arts contribute to that.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
So Cardiff just has the badge and doesn't support people. You've got to add to it. Absolutely.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Well, that's not very good, is it? No. It's a bit hypocritical.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Right, perhaps you should drink in the bar. Yes, why not?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Excellent. Prithpal, thank you very much indeed for your Carnival stories and more besides. It's been a pleasure.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Thank you. Take care.
