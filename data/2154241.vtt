00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Dory painted a lot of doors.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
That's what Tim...

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I saw that.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Yes, that's what Brian Lawrence told me.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You know Grand Door, down where we lived, down by the bridge?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Dory built those houses there.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Yes, he was a painter.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And they were painted. Some of the door panels in there were painted.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I heard that.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And he also invented a machine that planed the wood and put grooves in it.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And if you go in there, all the doors and the frames have got this wood.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And like there's five grooves in the middle.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Really?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And the planer did that and cut grooves as he did it.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So everything he did, he used this planer.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And that was George Dory? George Dory.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Well, one of the Dory, the old Dory, I suppose.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
He lived down where the doctor's surgery is as well.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
He built all those houses there.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Brinkoid? No, Kai Herbert Lane.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Yes, Sunnyfield, didn't he?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
He built Sunny...

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Is it Sunnyfield or Sunnyside?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It's Sunnyside, yes. That's right, the Evans family.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And the houses in front.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Because Sunnyside were built of what he had left from the other houses.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
From the ones on East Street?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Yes.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Oh, I see.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
At the back.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Oh, are they?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Yeah, you know, the cement and everything was pretty poor.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Well, I mean, they've been done up chiefly now.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
But they used to be all the windowsills were like concrete

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and they would fall into bits.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
They had new windows and new windowsills all the years.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Oh dear.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Well, they're still standing, aren't they?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Oh, that's right, you know.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Yes, and friends of mine were born there.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
You know, the Evans family, Cheryl and Janet.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I can't remember who lived there when I was young.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Of course, this was the far end of town.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Beyond the pale, isn't it?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Yeah, you didn't come beyond the clock.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Oh, there we are.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Oh, right, and Glandour was exactly where?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Tell me again.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
You know, where you turn down to the last arc.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Yes.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
On the corner there now.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Of course, of course, it's a holiday home.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
It's the Mid Wales holiday let's, isn't it?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Yeah, that's right, because it was full of foreigners this last weekend.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
There were three foreign cars there, I noticed.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Really?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Yeah.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
It's wonderful to see them all there.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And he built that and the next door to it.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And then I think Bernard's father built the two closest to the bridge.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
You know, but the Doreys' houses were quite different to Lloyd's houses, if you like.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So the Doreys, they've been in this area for a long time then, have they?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Well, it must have been like 1900s anyway.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Yes, and the Lloyd family, of course, they've been... Bernard Lloyd, well, there's so many Lloyds.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Yeah, well...

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Are you related to them?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Yes, yes.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
You must be.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Bernard is like... he was the first cousin to my father.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Mm-hmm.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Yeah.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Mm-hmm.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And then the generation before.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000
The Lloyds actually, it turns out by what I can understand, came from Levant.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
They were sheep, drovers.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Right.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And they ended up, when the railway came, that was when they came here, they ended up in St. Arlen

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
because the railway came and they drove the sheep to the railway and then settled there.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Oh, yeah.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Because I was standing on a grave outside the church gate there at some big funeral a few years ago.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And somebody came and said, you know whose grave you're standing on?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And I said, no.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And they said, well, he's a relation of yours, you look at it.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Oh, yeah.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And it was a Lloyd.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Wow, wow.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And reading between the lines, nobody's ever told it to me, but reading the lines,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
he was most likely the first one who settled like in St. Armen and got buried there.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Well, there we are.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
You can chase it back.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000
I'm wondering though, the memorial stoned Jimmy Lloyd now,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
are any of his family interested in taking it on, still going on with that type of work?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I think his daughter-in-law does a bit with Jimmy.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
His son, no, yeah, his daughter-in-law, that would be wouldn't it?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
His son's wife.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And I mean, I don't know because David, Jimmy's son, is too settled in what he does.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
He traps the new town every day.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
But his wife, and I do know the children, he's got a couple of boys, isn't he, I think?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
I really don't know much about this.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I think he has got a couple of boys, because there's no Lloyds coming at all, you know, no male Lloyds.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.000
But I did wonder about the memorial stone business, because that's been in the family for a while.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Well, since 1900 at least, if not earlier.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Like Ben.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Ben, Ben Lloyd.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Ben was really the, I suppose he was the first.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Didn't he do something in the Houses of Parliament?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
He did things all over the place, like, you know, he was a true artist, I should imagine,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
because my father used to say, oh, well, uncle, he'd have been an uncle to my father.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And dad used to say, well, Ben was one of these who did a project, like in Glasgow, if you like,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and then he came home and fiddled around for a year while he spent the money.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And then when he spent the money, he went out and did another one.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
He did an art that he operated, right?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Well, you know, I don't suppose it was as bad as that, but that was the way it was told to me.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000
He did a project somewhere and then he lived off the profit for as long as it lasted,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
kind of thing, before he did the next one.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And I mean, he did some work, the Fountains in Lucerne.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Indeed.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
I believe. And also Princess Street in Edinburgh, isn't it?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
The statue down the middle of that, he did some of the parts of that.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Did he?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Yes.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So I mean, he must have been internationally known then, wasn't he?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Yes.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
To get jobs like that.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And when you look, the war memorials all over Blooming Wales are done by him.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Yes.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Oh, most interesting.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
But he would have been like an uncle to my father.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And then the other one was Bernard's father, who was a brother to him.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
I can't remember Bernard's father.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000
He died like in 1939, I think. Something like that.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Whereas Uncle Ben, who was Jimmy's grandfather, I can remember him quite plain.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Well, you know, he must have lived until the 50s, I think.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Or the late 40s at least.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Right.
