00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
At this current time we've been man and wife for...

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.600
Since October 29th.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.200
Yeah, since last October.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.000
Okay. You said amazing adventure.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Yes, because we had to fight long and hard.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.800
I don't think people thought that we would actually get married.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:28.200
I think a few people thought it would just be a passing phase and fizzle out.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.000
And then one day we just said...

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Because we got engaged...

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Was it last February or the year before?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I think it was the year before.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.400
On Valentine's Day.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.600
And Steve proposed to me in his bedroom.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.200
Got the kitchen staff from here to prepare a lovely meal.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.400
It was steak and chocolate pudding, wasn't it?

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.200
And foam cocktail.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.800
It was.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.400
And halfway through he asked me to marry him.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.200
Do you remember what exactly you said, Steve?

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.600
Basically just asked you...

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.000
You hid it from me, didn't you?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.400
Yeah, I hid it for quite a while but in the end I asked you if you'd like to be my wife.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.400
You did. You hid it all day, didn't you?

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.000
And kept saying that I was to dress casually but I wasn't to come to your room, was I?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.800
No.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.800
No, and I didn't know why.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.000
And the care support staff, because I've got a special table to eat with, the care support staff...

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.800
Steve sneakily got that down there as well so he didn't have to assist me.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.600
And so he was very cunning but it was beautiful.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.600
And we had the table all done out, the kitchen did the table all done nice and...

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.200
And that is a memory that will always stay a beautiful memory.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.000
Were you frightened and were saying no and then he's destroying the friendship?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.200
Well, I was worried because I thought, well, how would you both feel if she was to say no?

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.800
And then we're living in the same place.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.600
And we're all...

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.800
Yeah, as you say, we're all together sort of thing and you'd always be thinking, wouldn't you?

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.000
But as things happened, I didn't have to worry about that for long.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The only time you had to worry about that was when you had to marry me.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.600
Yeah.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.400
How did you feel when you heard him say those words?

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.200
I was shocked. I didn't think I'd ever be in that situation again. Never.
