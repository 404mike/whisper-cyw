00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Mae'r investidur yn...

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Wel, beth yw hynny yn y lles?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Y lles.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
O, byddai wedi bod yn ystod ymlaen.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Byddai wedi bod yn ystod ymlaen.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Ie.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Do you remember, was there anybody else with you?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I would imagine my father would have watched that.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I can't remember who was with me,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but I'm sure my father would have watched it,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
because he was interested in history, you see.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Yes, I remember being impressed with the fashion.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The Queen's hat was like surrounded,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and I don't know if you've seen pictures of it yourself.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And the canopy was very modern,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and chairs, I think the people were allowed to keep the chairs afterwards,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
very plain, but very stark really, very modern for the time.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And yet you're in this historic castle that was so old.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
But it was very nice, the weather was nice I think as well.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I remember Princess Anne's dress as well,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
it was just the style at that time, very clear cut.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And I think they had pastel colours, the royal family,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
in their sort of light summer coats.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I remember also when the Queen brought Charles to the different areas

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
to present him to the people, I remember that bit clearly.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And of course from the paper beforehand,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I knew that they were going to be coming by train

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and being in a siding somewhere, and overnight.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And I think there were some demonstrations against it as well.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Some Welsh, I don't know whether it was Cymdeithas yr Iaith,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
or some of those didn't agree with it, and this kind of thing, I remember that.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I think there was some, I'm not sure, did a bomb go off,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
or something in the run-up to this,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
or there was some worry about it anyway, something like that.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
What do you remember seeing in the month leading up to the ceremony on television?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Oh, there was a lot on television.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Well I think as details emerged of who would be invited,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and some of the councillors and people like that from every part of Wales.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And what Lord Snowdon was going to wear,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
was he Constable of the Castle or something,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and he was in this, I think it was Green Velvet or something.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Because there was no precedent really for somebody like him,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
because I think he had organised it because he was Welsh

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and he was part of the Royal Family then, you see.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
So I remember as details emerged, that's what I remember,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:21.000
in the paper probably, and oh yes, I wish I'd got that investiture thing really.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I'll have a look afterwards, I'll just see if there is one place it might be.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
But yes, I remember the paper and I kept all this,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and also the timetable and who was doing what,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
that kind of thing would have come from the paper.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
In terms of some of the objections that you mentioned,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
where did you hear about those?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I think they would have been in the paper rather than television,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
because they may not have been on the British television,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
but they certainly would have been on the Welsh television,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
but we didn't have that, you see.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
So it must have been the newspaper I think.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
As a Welsh woman, how did the ceremony make you feel?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Oh, I felt...

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Well, I didn't disagree with it.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I didn't disagree at all.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Because after all, we are a United Kingdom, aren't we now?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And so, no, I didn't disagree with it at all really.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
I just didn't want any accidents to happen or anything like that.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I didn't mind if somebody objected,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
but I don't want any violence or anything like that, do you know?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Was there any sort of street parties and things going on in this area?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I don't think so.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Well, they weren't in my little hamlet when I lived then.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Erm, no.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
No.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
The only street party I ever remember was...

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Let me see. What was that about?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I think it was the Golden... The Silver Jubilee.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
The Silver Jubilee of the Queen.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
That would have been...

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Yes, it was soon after I came to live here.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And we had a street party just here.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
For the children, mainly.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
It was just the children.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And I know in school we'd made little crowns with gold paper

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and cut them out, sort of.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
They were quite intricate actually.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Quite small and just like that, like a saucer size.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And I made one myself and I put it on the table as a decoration.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Like a table decoration, you know.
