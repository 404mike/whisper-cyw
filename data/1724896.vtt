00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
How do you spend a Friday or Saturday night?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Watch telly.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Just the two of you?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Oh, sometimes I've got to go up mam's look after her so I don't get back to the bit up I sent at night on a Saturday.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So where's your mam?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Yeah, cos she won't.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Where is she then?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Malpas.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
How do you get that far?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Malpas.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And you look after her do you?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Yeah. She's 94 nearly 95 and she hasn't got any carers coming in.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So I'm going to see about carers now coming in so I can look after Linda.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So you go there on Saturday do you?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Yeah, Saturday after we see no friends I'll be up there on a Saturday afternoon.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Make sure I'm alright and then he goes up his mam's then.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Leave her about four and I'll get back at about seven.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And a Friday night you watch telly do you?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Yeah.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Are you usually staying together on a Friday night?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Yes.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Yeah, but sometimes I know Linda's here on her own I've got to go up and see mam.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You go on a Friday as well?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Yeah, every Friday night.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
But it's not long before you come back though.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
In the afternoon or in the afternoon I go up in the morning sometimes and I'll get back in about four o'clock.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Yeah.
