WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.120
My name is Deborah Jones and today is the 23rd of April 2021 and we're at the Me Time

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.240
service in Flambustland. So Sam could you tell me your name?

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.120
My name is Samantha Bethan Lloyd.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.360
Oh Bethan, that's a lovely name.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.600
Thank you.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:36.520
So this is part of the Flambustlany project, our Flambustland and I know you live outside

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.640
of Flambustland. Where do you live?

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.200
I live in Myford.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:50.760
Myford, yeah. And I think that you've got some stories to tell about your voluntary

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.560
work, haven't you?

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.560
Yeah.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.120
So what volunteering work have you done?

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:17.000
I've volunteered in a cattery. I've volunteered in Hope House. I've volunteered as well at

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:32.280
Paris Animal Welfare and that's it. And also I've been doing, I used to go to Paris Castle.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.080
Alright, so you've actually done some really interesting jobs haven't you?

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.080
Yeah.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.080
So tell me about the Paris, is it wildlife or animal?

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.080
Animal welfare.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.160
Can you tell me a little bit about that?

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:57.640
Well the thing is like you volunteer, you do all the clothes, you iron them and put them

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:05.480
on the stall and then there's pictures of cats that need to be rehomed and all the money

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:15.080
goes to the animal charities and people just, loads of people come, like we've got the books

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:23.440
that you can get, different clothes, jewellery, everything you can think of in there. But

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:32.160
also we sort the stuff out and we do, infect all the toys and all the stuff.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.320
So did you get stuff donated?

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.320
Yes.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.320
And it was like a shop?

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.320
Yes.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.640
So did you have any, so you didn't have any animals there?

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.640
No, no, no.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:51.200
So the money went to the various charities. That's brilliant, that's brilliant.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.200
And so tell me a little bit about how you came to volunteer at Paris Castle.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:06.200
Well since I was a little girl, I loved, I've been there a couple of times and growing up

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.920
I actually loved the castle. I thought there was something special about it but I couldn't

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000
get my head around what it was. And I remember one day my nan taking me round and something

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:30.000
just clicked. And now I'm like, I'm getting older and once I moved to my food and then

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.000
some do-you-work that asked me if I'd like to go and volunteer there and if someone asked

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:46.080
me a question like that about any castle you wouldn't turn it down would you? So I went

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:53.080
and oh, it was just a dream come true. I remember just having a bit of tears in my eyes. I couldn't

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:00.080
believe that I was there. I never thought I was able to go to a place like that. And

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:07.080
sadly my nan's not around anymore and it was really hard for me not able to tell her. But

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:14.160
oh, I just loved the place. So what did you like? What really did you like about it? The

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:21.160
atmosphere of looking when people come around. Their faces. It's interesting to watch the

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.520
go to certain things they're not allowed to touch and there was one day where it was really

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.520
busy. I stepped in one room where it was like one room there, one room there and you have

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.520
to be in the middle and this woman was touching this and I said you mustn't touch that and

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:47.520
she just looked at me and I just didn't know what to do. So she was trying to tell everybody

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.520
else. So I went and ran over to somebody else to say I need help here. Oh was that, you

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.520
went and asked, who did you go and ask? One of the other volunteers because it was getting

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.520
a bit too much telling these people not to. And there was one time when you're not allowed

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:10.520
to take photos there and one of the people there said that everyone comes from walk of

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:18.520
life, different countries, different people come and this one person took a photo of me,

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:26.520
not like a phone, took a photo right in my face. How did that make you feel? Well I'm

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:33.520
not sure if I'm right or if I wanted to punch them but I was smiling, I was smiling, I was

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:40.520
smiling because my heat level was going up, up, up. And I said could you please not do

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:48.520
that please. Would you like to explain for people that are listening that openly you

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:56.520
have autism? Autism and Williams syndrome too. So to actually do what you did for volunteering

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.520
and being in contact with the public you must have found that really stressful at times.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:11.520
Is there anything that helped with your stress levels? Well I would just tell them about

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.520
it, forget what, it doesn't matter what, just forget about it and just concentrate on what

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:33.520
you're doing with the people. Because if you don't do that and they ask you, it's

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:41.520
just, you know, you just lose it. So you've just got to try and, something like forget

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:48.520
about it and just concentrate on little things in the castle to explain to them. So did you

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.520
actually then, you were showing people around and explaining a little bit of the history,

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.520
some of the stories. Can you remember any of the stories? Because I haven't been to

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.520
the ice castles looking so hard. Well there's an interesting, very interesting story that

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:13.520
sends my shivers up my spine. That there's some ghost in one of the rooms and I think

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:24.520
it's the one on the top of the stairs as you go up, up and ramble around there. I was with

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:32.520
one of the volunteers and she was looking at me and I was looking at her and I was like,

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:43.520
hi, what are you doing there? You're not supposed to be there. And at that point it didn't register

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:51.520
in my mind that there was a ghost there. So she looked at me and she said, Samak, would

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:58.520
you like to go to another room? And I was like, well why is that person there when they're

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:05.520
not supposed to? I couldn't get my head around it. And then I went into another room and

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:15.520
like before the people even came and there was one bit where I was down the stairs. It

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:21.520
was called the ballroom room or it's lush with all the stuff, all the gold stuff. Everything

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:28.520
is just beautiful, the artwork, everything of it. And that was just stunning. It was

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:35.520
like a piece out of a movie it is right down there. And I don't know, I just stood there

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.520
and it was so quiet. And then I heard, and I thought I could hear people around but there

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:49.520
was nobody around. I thought that was strange. And then once we had a break she kindly, well

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:57.520
bravely explained to me that there was a ghost up the stairs. And you'd seen her? I'd seen

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:04.520
this man. And what can you describe him to me? He looked really, he had interesting a

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:12.520
gown on and like a little cap, like a little cap like them big ones but then was this interesting

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:22.520
thing. I thought, well that man was not supposed to be there. And it was like clear as day

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:28.520
he was right in front of me. I said, excuse me what are you doing here? And he totally

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:35.520
ignored me and I thought have I said something wrong? Am I being rude? Or is he being rude

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:45.520
because he's not speaking to me. I was like what the hell. That's a brilliant story. It

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:54.520
was just incredible. So you were a tour guide for the rooms for all the tourists coming

00:09:54.520 --> 00:10:01.520
in. Yes. So did you do any other jobs at the castle? I didn't for a while because sadly

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:14.020
the volunteer's husband died so I didn't go back to the castle for a while. And then as

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:22.520
well a couple of months later I met Kat. Oh yeah Kat was there. Mum told me about it

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.520
so I thought, oh I said I couldn't get to stand again because I was so excited if I

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:35.520
was able to go back on it or what was happening. Anyway people don't tell me these days anymore.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:42.520
And then when I went up there I spoke to Kat and she explained to me what I was doing about

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:49.520
the garden. Doing a bit of everything again going, it's like restarting everything. And

00:10:53.520 --> 00:11:00.520
doing the garden was absolutely fun. I love looking around the garden. What's your favourite

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:07.520
bit of the garden? I would say all the different trees and the flowers because apparently they're

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:16.520
really hard to keep that remembered. I think it's the most important thing. I think it's

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:22.520
the trees and the flowers because apparently they're really hard to keep that momentum

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:27.520
what kind of structure they are because they're very old. It's a lot of work isn't it? It's

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:34.520
a lot of work to do because you've got to do exactly the same thing or they won't be

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:42.520
very happy. No. So you carried on doing, when you went back the second time, you carried

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:50.520
on doing the tour guide stuff did you? Yes. That came quite easily I would imagine because

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:59.520
you could remember some things. Yes. And did you work in the ticket office? Yes. What was

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:06.520
that like? I didn't enjoy that at all. Why not? Because people were a bit, I don't know

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:13.520
but not snotty but I don't know, impatient. These were the guests coming in I suppose

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:22.520
I think. They were a little bit cocky if I must say that. A little bit arrogant. Yeah.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:34.520
And it's like excuse me I'm talking. They'd be rude. This woman wasn't very pleasant

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:41.520
and just smiled again. It's very difficult isn't it to keep your cool? So demanding.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:49.520
It's like I'm not very good on mine. I am good at patience but sometimes starting to

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:58.520
get the layers of my temperament I explode. I don't mean to but I do. So you had to try

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:06.520
and keep yourself under control was that difficult? Yes because my face was hurting. With the

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:13.520
smiling? Yes. I wanted to do something and I was like no come on be professional. So

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:20.520
how did you get to, how did you travel? How did you travel to Paris Castle for my part?

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:25.520
I was very lucky because my mum picked me up and brought me back. Oh that was handy.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:32.520
And also the other volunteer did the same thing as well so it was really nice. So do

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:39.520
you keep in contact with anybody from Trust Buddies or from the volunteering programme

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:46.520
from before? Yes I only one Christine because she lives in my village. Oh right. Yeah sadly

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:52.520
she lost her husband last night. He was really, he was funny. He did the same thing. And did

00:13:52.520 --> 00:14:03.520
he? Yeah it was funny. He used to make me laugh. He told this one guy off before taking

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:12.520
photographs and for him it must be hard as well because he was really older and he knew

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:19.520
the business. He knows everything inside out. And there was one time when I was in my volunteer

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:26.520
and I was going into the bottom where the kitchen is and you've got this room, the pool

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:35.520
room I think it's called with them grotesque birds. Oh right. Is that near the staff room?

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:40.520
Yeah it's not far from there. And there was a guy that wasn't supposed to be, because

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:49.520
he was trying to tell us about the grotesque in the thing and he didn't want to leave.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:59.520
And for me that was really frightening and my anxiety levels went. So I, because someone

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.520
came down because I was having a bit of a panic attack at that time because I thought

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:11.520
something bad, suddenly things were evaluating in my head that something bad was going to

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:17.520
happen. Yeah. And I didn't know what to do. I didn't know whether to, I don't have a twin

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:23.520
or anything so I couldn't just. Yeah. So the staff took me over the room and calmed me

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:29.520
down. And he left there to, just what he's never been back since because he got told

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:36.520
off once. Did he? Yeah. Good job too. Because I thought he was going to hurt somebody.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:41.520
That's not a nice feeling to feel threatened is it and frightened when you're at work.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:49.520
Because somebody told him to leave and you just wouldn't have it. No. So when you left

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:56.520
Trust Buddies, so how long were you working there before you left? The first time, how

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:05.520
long, well the first time you did your volunteering, that was for how long? A few months? Yeah,

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:14.520
a few months and then a few years on and off. On and off. Yeah. And how was the, how did

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:21.520
you find the training? Was it, did you find it difficult, easy? Did you find some bits

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:28.520
of it, you could learn better than others? Yeah there were some bits because some of

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:34.520
the words that you have to explain go over, that was a bit challenging but I was getting

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:42.520
excited because I thought oh this is going to be fun yet again. It must have been absolutely

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:49.520
brilliant for thinking from when you were a little girl and enjoying the castle because

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:55.520
I know you like history as well so it must have ticked so many bells. Oh it was just,

00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:00.520
it was one of those moments in my life that I just cried a few tears because I said my

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:07.520
nan I'm going to polish all those antiques I remember telling her. Yeah my nan just laughed

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:12.520
and laughed because she knows how much I used to love going up, they went there all the time,

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:17.520
we had picnics, we had cakes, everything there, it was great fun and I thought one day I'm

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:23.520
going to be there and I did it, I thought wow. I had like shivers down my spine. So

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.520
did you do the same job with Trust Buddies when you were volunteering the last time?

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:35.520
Yes. It was just doing the tour guides was it? And also the gardener, and the ticket

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:40.520
office as well. Oh right, because they've got a coffee shop there didn't you? Yeah I

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:46.520
didn't do any of that. You didn't, that wasn't your cup of tea, excuse the pun. I didn't

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:53.520
think I could handle rude people. So what was your most favourite job there then? Oh

00:17:53.520 --> 00:18:03.520
Jesus. Oh I can't choose, I like both. You like, yeah. But I didn't like the ticket office.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:11.520
So you loved the gardens, working the gardens and helping people get the gardens ready.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:16.520
Yeah. Because some people were lost in there, like I said, because I was in the garden,

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:22.520
I said go over there, go over there, da da da, and you'll be fine. Oh people getting

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:30.520
lost in the gardens and not knowing where they were. Yeah. Well Sam, I think that was

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:34.520
really interesting and thank you very much.
