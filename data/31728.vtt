00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.880
The Butterfly Effect

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.720
Do you remember the first time that you hit me?

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:24.840
A left out plate triggered it off, a little domino falling, culminating in a quick sting,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.800
a piece of fresh fruit, soft and velvety, now bruised, the sweetness of taste, a little

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.600
bitter now and prone to take rot.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.600
I cried and phoned Mum, she served up some lines taken out of the jar labelled coping.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.440
But you were so high on a pedestal, built up from the dust, brought in from some old

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.280
places, bedrooms filled with pink and wishes for towers of ivory, a child vacuum pulling

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.760
for a touch.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.320
I couldn't see your faults up close.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.880
This tower was cracked, a dud egg in a box, yet inside I was deprived of that sight.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.960
So when you said I only did it to teach you, I actually thanked you.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.760
Like the fool, I danced around in bells, trying to keep you with a smile.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.000
I gave you flowers and songs, false grunts and perfect poses.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.280
I gave you the benefit of the doubt so many times that the doubt began to change.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.840
A caterpillar, my heart, young and hungry, ate up your blame and your childhood rages.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.200
I consumed them for you.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.560
The memory of those bullies who chased you at school, put you in a ring made from bags

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.480
and scuffed knees, beat you in formation like a ritual each day, and you kept it secret

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.160
like you'd soiled yourself and were too scared to say.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.400
So my pity and magnet held me to you, tin man, devoid of something vital.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.600
I took your life's lines, waved the threads of them into a cocoon.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.600
I bound up my mouth and trapped words went bad, a compost formed right for some growth.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.800
And so I festered and melted all down, went back to a primordial soup made of hugs and

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.280
a lullaby hush.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.840
What a wonder it was to find that I'd grown wings, fragile membranes, new and quite raw.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:30.040
I struggled myself loose, bore out of my bindings, and I found a window then and let them unfurl.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.840
I flew out of the tower, your princess, no more.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:41.080
So now looking back at the arc of my days, seeing how a proverb breathes, as closed doors

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.400
do reveal ones that open.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:51.400
I can thank you quietly, almost under my breath, for what to the world looked like a caterpillar

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.400
was to the caterpillar but a fly.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:15.000
I danced with my friends last night, wild Celtic women, our faces alight, with the joy

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.640
of our bodies, unfettered responses to this tribal fusion, Afro and Celt, an outburst

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:35.160
of freedom, pure and heartfelt.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.880
So this is a poem I wrote ages ago actually.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.320
It's called The Weed.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.640
I was never as pure as the lily, never as sweet as the rose.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.520
I was a thing that strangled up, an ugly dirty bit of scrub that suffocated buttercups and

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.080
muscled in on marigolds.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.000
Unlike the lily I toiled, and unlike the rose I did not bud.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.440
I was a thing that clambered, climbed, a filthy root that grew in slime.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.280
On daisy heads and daffs I dined, and through my roots I ate up mud.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.360
The lily wears an elegant gown, the rose wears elaborate garb.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.680
I was a thin and dirty child, but now I'm fat and strong and wild.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.120
Whole families of flowers have been defiled by my poisoned barbs.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.960
The lily cries sweetly for mercy, the rose bends his soft head and begs.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.160
But I am a thing without feeling or fears.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:41.880
They fall on deaf ears as I squeeze dry their tears and drink their sweet sap to the dregs.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.600
This hearth's a magic invitation.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:53.200
Every memory feels elemental forces, igniting nerve endings, zinging the senses alert, gathering

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.840
for shamanic ritual, offering to source.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.280
Healing the earth, healing myself.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.560
Celebrations, energy, healing the earth, healing myself.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.960
Dancing and singing, drumming and thinking, healing the earth, healing myself.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.200
Nurture, desire, strength, commitment and boundaries.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:23.280
Anointed with boggy earth blood blessing, hedonistic bodies crackle and moan in the

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.440
trees and in the tents.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:34.160
Base chakra sinks and opens, yogic lubrication attunes muscles to dance the soul of Nia.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.000
Shoulder spiral concentrates Aikido Chi.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Sink holeing powerful vibrations into radial wand, allowing hands to sculpt and mould,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.520
enfold raw elemental offerings, returning to source.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.720
Healing the earth, healing myself.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.880
Dancing with intent.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.120
Healing the earth, healing myself.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.560
Fingers with focus flowing.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.720
Healing the earth, healing myself.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.760
Nurture, desire, strength, commitment and boundaries.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.880
We trip before we get up again.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.000
We trip before we get up again.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.960
We trip before we get up again.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.320
We trip before we get up again.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.440
We trip before we get up again.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.920
We trip before we get up again.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:30.040
I'm in Kinspite in Wales, which was recently in bloom in the National Botanic Garden and

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.120
I went and saw it and it was a bloody ugly thing, huge, massive, monstrous, grey, looked

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.720
like a big bulging head.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:44.600
But when it bloomed it was beautiful, it was amazing, it had these lovely golden cups and

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.400
they were full of nectar and you can drink them, humans can drink them, animals can drink

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.880
them and it kind of gives you a high.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:57.760
So this is a poem about that plant, it's called a Puyya plant, which is kind of a horrible

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.760
name as well for this thing.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.120
It only blooms every ten years, so that was in April this year and this is a poem for

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.120
the Puyya.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.960
Puyya, they call you, the words sticky in their mouths.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.000
You prickle the roof of the glass house and settle the groups of visiting classes.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.680
Like a nettle your leaves are sting sharp, laced with thorns.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.960
Cruel, they remark, your taste is for animal flesh, which they hook, pull in and starve

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.960
to death.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.960
Their blood is your food, your bed more wet with this than dew.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:37.780
From the Andes to Llanarthni you came, a monster baby in a way, eight feet tall and closer

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.840
to a mutant than a flower.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.040
Towering above the others, a giant in the nursery.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:49.000
Cursed to slowness, reliant on your new owners, still you grew, your brontosaurus neck too

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
thick for them to prune, a Chilean imposter that loomed above its human masters.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.200
But now, a decade later, you're in bud, about to blossom.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.200
Your body is round and fulsome as a woman's.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.160
Crowds come to marvel, wondering at your beauty, eyes hunger for your form.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.560
Cameras snap and looks are thrown, but sweeter than before.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.000
You ignore them, take no note.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Your name now sweet as nectar in every thirsting throat.
