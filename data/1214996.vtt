You're listening to Joe talking about love and sex.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.080
I have been in love before or I think I felt what it is to be in love, not very often.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.840
But I see a couple of times I've had that real feeling of love.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.640
Now I don't know whether this is an autism thing or what or a Joe thing but

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.320
when I fall in love with somebody I wouldn't want them to know that and I'm happy just to

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.720
feel the love and then not be involved. And what I find difficult is the fact that people can be

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.920
in love and have sex and intimacy. I don't understand that. I can feel lust towards somebody

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.000
of the opposite sex but I can't love a person I feel lustful about and I find it difficult

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.840
to feel sexual about the person that I feel in love with. Because if you're in love with

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.600
somebody it's a different thing. It's pure love but if you have sex with somebody or you feel

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:59.440
a sexual feeling towards somebody then that is a pure physical need issue. And what I find really

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:06.720
difficult to understand is how people bring both together and how sex is seen as an expression of

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.320
that love. I thought how can that be? And what's confusing is some people for instance will go out

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.000
to go for stripper, watch strippers or will go for prostitution just for that physical need.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.320
And that makes me think well if they're going for that physical need then how can I be connected

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.040
to love? And I my brain can't do it. My brain does not compute that. So it's only twice I think I've

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:38.080
really fell in love to the point where I can't forget that person even now. I feel brokenhearted

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.360
in some ways about it.
