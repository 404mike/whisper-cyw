Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project, interviewer Steve Fletcher, interviewee Liz

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:16.320
Dutton, the venue Swicker Office and the date is Sunday the 16th of November 2015. Liz,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.560
would you be kind enough to spell your name for us for the record?

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:31.680
Liz Dutton. Thank you much indeed. Can you tell us when and how did you first get involved or hear

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:39.760
about the Cardiff Carnival? Well in my work as a youth worker part of my role was to organize play

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:47.400
schemes and one year I decided that I didn't want to actually organize and run a play scheme that I

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:56.840
just wanted to be part of and just be a play worker. So during that time somebody mentioned

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:07.160
to me that there was carnival going on at Fitzhallen School so I was a bit curious so I went along to

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:15.600
see you know what was going on and basically you know didn't leave. So that would have been back in

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.680
the distant past 1991. Yeah. And I remember you saying that you remember what you did I mean you

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.480
were dancing on the day itself were you in a dance group? Yeah. What kind of costume did you have the very first time round?

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:39.360
Gosh it was I think the basis of it was the skirt was I think was purple I knew I know

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.280
there was a multi-colored sash there was a headdress and there were bobbles on shoes and things.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.720
It was a tribute to indigenous people I seem to remember. I think that was it. Which indigenous people I couldn't tell you

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.520
not off the top of my head by frankly. And that very first time that you got involved

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.240
did your children get involved at that point or did you bring them on on board the carnival bus

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:11.840
No no they got involved at that point my daughter actually was in the dance group with me and she had a costume

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.800
and my son was more or less Stuart he got involved in like the Stuart because he didn't want to like

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.040
dress up in carnival costume. But he supported the carnival every year you know those people in the yellow bibs are absolutely vital to it.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.880
Yeah most definitely but yeah my daughter was in the dance group same as me and she really enjoyed it that first time.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.080
That's fantastic. So whenever I think of your role in carnival I always refer to you as a carnival queen

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.480
because you always wore to my mind except for this possibly this first year

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.360
you always wore a large backpack costume which meant that you know you were what can I say

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.120
brilliant to look at you know big big costumes. So how did that come about was it was it working with Amaru or?

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:08.880
Yes it was actually. You always seem to design a costume that was like really large

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.160
but with a backpack so yeah yeah yeah. With a backpack quite dynamic really. Yes. It was fun wearing them

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.840
yeah it was you know it was really. Did the design get was it ever too what was it like I mean you

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.600
you're having to rehearse in these things you're having to add to them you come the big day of the

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.920
big parade you know you can take an hour or two with getting ready and all the rest of it. How comfortable

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.200
were they or did it change over time? It did change over time I mean in the beginning they were a bit

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.680
uncomfortable and you know adjustments were always being made and stuff but you know over

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.520
a course of time the backpacks got lighter so they were easier to move around in and yes I see

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.480
it seems to me to think yeah eventually we found tubular steel and that's right a joy of foam rubber

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.320
yeah that's right yeah so I can remember the early ones seem to virtually cripple people and

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.160
slowly but surely we yeah as a group we improved in what we were doing definitely yeah but um

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:16.480
you know with the carnival it was the whole thing of on the day you know watching people's faces

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.960
especially the little children you know in awe of what they were seeing you know because it was so

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.640
colorful and dynamic and they'd want to come up and touch you and you know and that kind of thing

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:33.360
and you know that part of it you know it was it was really good it was and the build-up to it as

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:42.400
well you know the whole carnival camp um I mean my son and daughter I mean they they met so many

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.360
people and they've grown up with so many um people of their their own age and and yet they only used

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.440
to meet them once a year a carnival camp but it was like they'd spoken to them yesterday

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.480
do you know what I mean and they've made lifelong friends and not only that it enabled my children

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:11.280
as well to learn to work alongside adults you know to work alongside adults and not only that

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.280
to work alongside lots of different people because my son and daughter they're grown up now and they

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:24.320
can they can relate to anybody you know whether they're old young you know you know any background

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.520
any background at all any walk of life at all yes and you know carnival you know played a

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.720
part in that to be honest you know it did yeah without without a doubt but you must have a fairly

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:41.840
amazing skills base now I mean uh again when I think of you I think of you sticking stuff on and

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.880
certainly with a glue gun and not necessarily going ouch ouch ouch every time that uh yeah you

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.600
push it and the rest of it so yes I mean tell me about the carnival camp and the skills that you

00:05:51.600 --> 00:06:01.680
learned or what was that like it was quite amazing really um you know being part of a team of people

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:09.360
that that were you know putting together costumes I mean you have um you know particular tables that

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:16.160
were specific in certain parts of costumes and you know even just by watching other people you

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:22.160
were able to pick up skills that you could use again yourself I mean especially in my work um

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.640
like working with young people yeah you know I could take those skills that I was actually

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:32.720
doing and actually observing back to you know my work as a youth worker and a play worker I think

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.800
you also you mentioned you also did this in terms of some of the percussion and the rhythm and yeah

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:43.920
yes yeah um when I ran play schemes um I actually took the skills that I'd learned in carnival and

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.960
put them to use within the play schemes carnival theme every time I did a play scheme there was

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:55.280
always a carnival theme used to do tie-dye make headdresses I purchased instruments so they could

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:04.000
have a little percussion band and also um one year within my community um I organized

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:11.440
a carnival theme where Splot is the community I live in yeah and um we did a procession with

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.760
young people dressed up made costumes and doing percussion around Splot and that was part of um

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:25.440
Splot carnival uh it seemed to recall as well that um yeah obviously carnival the carnival camp ends

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.920
with a big carnival day in the parade but carnival art sort of as you say permanates into youth work

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:37.600
it certainly happened in schools and uh you reminded me earlier that uh there was an instance

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:43.280
where some of your group performed on stage at the Sherman theater is that right yeah that was

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.480
I can't remember what year that was but um obviously because I had a passion for carnival

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.520
in my work as a youth work I tried to encourage some of the young people that I work with to take

00:07:53.520 --> 00:08:02.720
part and managed to also get some parents to take part as well and following the big carnival parade

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:10.720
um we um the young people performed their routine in the Sherman theater which was really

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:17.280
really lovely was absolutely fantastic but because you've got besides being a carnival queen of some

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:24.880
renown um you are a long-standing member of Samba Galez the college school Samba yeah yeah uh I

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:30.640
think you're sort of actually born born with a go-go bell in your hand I think so yeah absolutely

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:37.280
just in terms of Samba Galez um standout experiences or gigs I mean what uh what did

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.880
you ever go away sometimes we used to go away and play gigs yeah I mean islands did you come on to

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:49.040
no I didn't go to Ireland I did Glastonbury oh that's more than I did I think Glastonbury actually

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:54.160
used to conflict every year with the blind avon carnival so I would organize for the group to go

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.280
to Glastonbury yeah and I'd do blind avons such was my dedication to the job so I've never been

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:06.400
to Glastonbury yeah I went to glass what was that like that was absolutely amazing um I don't know

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.400
if you remember Jean that used to be in the band yeah bless her she's passed away now yeah yeah well

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:17.920
it was um when Jean was in the band we went to um and I'd never ever been to Glastonbury before

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:23.520
so I had no idea you know and it was it was an absolutely amazing time can you remember who was

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:29.680
headlining that year was a big name oh excellent yeah she started singing Venus Like a Child

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:35.200
with a very funny voice yeah yeah Bjork was headlining the year I went and it was that

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:40.240
I haven't been since because that experience for me was the best you never ever top that I don't

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.600
think so no you know you went there with the artist passes and the rest of it yeah that was you know

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:54.480
it was amazing um also with um Samba Band went to Edinburgh for hold my name yes I can't remember

00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:01.840
I went I was there I was there that was truly amazing yes I'm very cold you know it was you know

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.880
to be in that street on that it was amazing there was a huge party of us there's probably about 40

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:12.800
of us yeah we were a whole coach whole coach you know we sold it out yeah and I remember before we

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.800
even got off the coach people were coming out of the pubs and wanting us to play there and then

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.760
if Johnny just arrived yes that sounds like a whole lot of people yeah yeah totally wild that was

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:27.200
absolutely amazing as well um well you're undoubtedly a carnival hero you're certainly

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:33.280
a carnival queen if through the magic of this recorder you're speaking to people in the future

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:39.760
I had to summarize or just let them know what was the value yeah what is what was the value

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.880
is the value of carded carnival what what words what thoughts come to mind as a final sort of

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:55.040
why was it so important for you for other people well it got me involved in something that

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:02.800
I had no experience of before and didn't know about you got to meet so many different people

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:10.640
from different walks of life who you you became friends with um and there's so many skills that

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:16.720
you can learn as well and you know on the actual day it's totally amazing you know the the buildup

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:23.760
to carnival but I think it's it's meeting other people you know um I think that that's

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:28.800
quite interesting to you know to meet other people from different walks of life yeah absolutely

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:35.280
absolutely what what did it feel well how did you feel the public responded to you as a queen

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:40.640
as your parading I mean did you feel that yeah did you feel the love I could definitely feel

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:48.800
no it was um it was really really good because um because obviously my work with young people

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:54.640
anyway you know um and you know when they see me dressed up you know they they were transformed

00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:02.320
well transformed that's it that's the word steam transformed you know um it it did sort of sort of

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.800
ignite something that they might want to take part themselves do you know what I mean but um

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.400
the whole experience I mean you know if anybody ever gets a chance to take part in a carnival I

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.520
would suggest that they do I think on that note Liz Dutton thank you very much for your

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.160
carnival memories you're welcome Steve thank you
