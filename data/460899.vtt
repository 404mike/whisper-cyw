00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So let's have a focus on the 97 campaign.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is the devolution campaign.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The devolution campaign.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
What are your recollections of that?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Well, I was...

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
When Blair formed his first government,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:28.000
he asked me to be the minister for post-16 education training

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and regional development agencies.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And so I worked with David Blunkett, who was Secretary of State for Education.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And I mean, essentially, I was university's minister

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
because we had to take through...

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I had to take through the first tuition fees bill.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And I've still got the scars on my back to prove it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And Blunkett called me in very early on in...

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
not long after we'd come to government.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
He said, you know all about this devolution stuff.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
He said, you and Straw, I know you two were working on this

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
when you were on the Shadow on the First Team.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I said, yeah, I was.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And he said, well, listen, I'm not going to go to this bloody...

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000
this cabinet committee to draw up the Scottish and Welsh settlements.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You've got to go.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I said, I'm going to take this tuition fees bill.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We had a big row about it.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And he said, no, no, you do it.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So I turned up and I think I was the only person at that meeting

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that wasn't in the cabinet because it was a cabinet committee meeting.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And it was chaired by Derry Irving, Lord Irving.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And when he wasn't chaired, Jack Straw was chaired.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And Representative Wales and his kind of brief sojourn in that post

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
was none other than Ron Davis.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And every single meeting there was blood on the walls.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
It was...I mean, you know, this was really rough stuff.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And it went on for a very long time.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And in the meantime, Blair was an absolute...

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I mean, a real fanatic for devolution.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I mean, he was absolutely convinced that this was, you know,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
this had to be pushed through.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And believe me, Blair, when he got messianic about something,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
was quite a force.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And so everyone was expected to do their bit.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And we did.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I mean, it wasn't so bad for me, but for people like Paul Murphy

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and Ron Davis and all these people who were so vociferously

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
opposing it, you know, chin-neck, right?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
You know, suddenly they're all on their feet saying,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
what a great thing it is.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And I always find that a bit strange, I must say.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
But I'm saying that it was a great thing.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And having said that, I think it was a pretty good campaign

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
because the money initially was on us losing the vote.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And it was a pretty close thing in the end, as you know.
