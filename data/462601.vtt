00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What are your earliest memories of television?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:18.000
My earliest memories of television I think must have been possibly the coronation of the Queen

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
because that was about the time that my parents had a television

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and prior to that of course we didn't have one at home

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:39.000
but when the coronation came that was about the first time we had one in our own home

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
so my grandparents didn't have one obviously

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
so that really was my first recollection of having it in my own home

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I was aware of television and of other people having it

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
but I'd never had the opportunity to sort of sit and watch it myself

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but having said that I am not a big television addict

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I'm quite happy with a little television screen

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
my husband had a much larger television

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
but after he passed away I decided it was too big and heavy so that went

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and people always comment

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Gosh how do you manage to see what you know on television

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
it's totally adequate for what I need

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and I listen to the radio quite a lot in the day

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
because I feel like in work and do jobs

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and still keep myself informed

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
but with television it's not quite as easy

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
because it's a moving picture you tend to want to sit and watch it

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
which is nice to be able to relax I quite agree

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
but I'm not a big television fan

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
How have your viewing patterns changed over the years?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I would say I watch more now in retirement

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and because I live on my own possibly

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
because when my husband was alive as with most families

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
the remote control was always that side wherever he was

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and so it was a matter of popping in

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and then if there was something that I was interested in

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
that he was watching maybe I would sit and watch with him

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
but generally I'd just let him have his choice

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and he sort of chose what he was interested in

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
if there was anything I was particularly interested in

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
yes I would sit and watch it

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
but now because I'm on my own and I have more time

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I have my own choice and I can watch whatever programmes I'm interested in

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
but as I say I'm not a very big fan of it

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Have you any experience of watching television with a lot of other people or in a public place?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
In my early days when television was very new

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
yes I know when my parents first had the television

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and the coronation was on and I can't remember which royal wedding was on

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I remember my mother inviting people in

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
because other people that were her friends and neighbours that didn't have

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
were obviously very keen and interested to see

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and they would be quite a houseful

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and then you know it's a social occasion

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
because people would sit down and they'd have their cups of tea or coffee

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and their sandwich or biscuit

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and it was really quite pleasant

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
but that's gone now hasn't it

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
because everybody's got one, two or even three or four televisions in their home

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
it's not just the family one

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
the youngsters have got their own televisions in their rooms now haven't they

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and it's become well part of life today

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
it's just an accepted part of life that everybody has a television

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
similarly I suppose to when I was a child

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
the radio was the thing that we liked to have

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:33.000
but those are my early recollections of social occasions with television

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
everything that you've seen on television

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
what would you say has had the greatest effect on your impact on you?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I must say that I enjoy watching operas on television

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and when you get somebody like Bryn Terfel

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Geraint Evans going way back

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Dame Gwyneth Jones

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and when you see people like that performing

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
who are Welsh people

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
it gives a big thrill

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and this is one of the things I feel that television has helped to bring to the working class person

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
it gives you that opportunity to see wonderful performances

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
which we were denied before unless we had the means to go to the theatre

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
or travel to London, maybe Liverpool or Manchester

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:44.000
but we were very very limited in our musical standards I feel before the advent of television

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I know we could hear it on radio but it's not quite as good as seeing an actual performance is it?
