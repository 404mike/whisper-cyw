00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Make it 22, that's the street for love.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm different, I'd hear.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Who are these people again?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Margaret Powell, she's our oldest kind of little resident.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
She's in Bringuy at the moment.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Her mother wanted us to go to school until she was about eight,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
because of course it was a...

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Oh, that must have been a different school.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
That's why she went to school, though.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Is this Lennar's house?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It's amazing, old father.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
See, Mark's in Yorswyr.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Oh, that's it, Mark, sorry.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Yorswyr.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It's amazing how far they've gone.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I had a cousin who, before she was five,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
she was walking four miles to school.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
That's not unusual, is it?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
No.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
In the snow.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If she's born in 22, that means she was only three years old.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
She looks more than that there, doesn't she?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Yes, yes, yes.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
No, it must have been 35.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Yeah, she'd be...

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
That must have been...

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
They've got that wrong, it must have been 35, surely.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Well, the front row would be five or six, wouldn't it?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I would think.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
1520, 2028.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
No, it must have been 1935, that.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
These are all in Nusselt School, aren't they?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
It's a bit more.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Yeah.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Yeah.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And all these rooms.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Yeah.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Nusselt School.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Oh, Nusselt School.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Whoa.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Well, the lady who lives next door to me...

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Edgar Thomas must have been...

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
That must be Thomas' father, mustn't it?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Yeah.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Thomas' grandfather.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Yeah, Edgar Thomas, Thomas Igo.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Yeah.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Oh, Bill Jones, I've got a bill.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Shall we see it too?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Doris Lloyd.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Doris Lloyd.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
She need to be...

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
She wouldn't want to slide down, would she?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Wow.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Oh, a dying carcoyd.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Wow.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
How the hell is that?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Long walk to school, here you go.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Oh, sure is some karma.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
School at nine o'clock and close at four ten,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and walk to school from long distances.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Oh, eight miles, they took the medium out,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
a bottle of teal milk.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Had to be something.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
A lantern's by the teachers to light away.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Oh, it comes.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I should have brought Mrs Evans down here.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
She was the last headmistress of Llymouth Old School.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Who was?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Mrs Evans, she lives next door to me.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Still? She's still alive?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Wow.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
She was the last one in Llymouth Old School,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
but I mean, she's 80ish, I think.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Her husband's just died now a few months ago,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
when he was 83, I think.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So she must have stopped there in about 1960,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
haven't you?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Oh, later than that.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Yeah.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Later?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Yeah.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
When did it turn into a whole?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
She was headmistress there,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
well, she was the only teacher, I think.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Yeah.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And then they closed the school,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and she went to Brintingale.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Right.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
She retired from Brintingale.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Oh, you're asking me,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
this is a photograph, isn't it?
