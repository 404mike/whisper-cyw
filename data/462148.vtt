00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I fought it against devolution.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And I don't remember a lot on the television, but there must have been a lot.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And my family were always Labour.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And I think at the time Labour were actually encouraging people to vote no.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And we did vote no. Well I voted no, I don't know what anybody else in the family voted.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It was fear I think really, because you didn't know what you were getting into.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So I can't say I remember a lot about the individuals on the television, but I do remember the debates going on.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And of course after I'd voted no, we had Margaret Thatcher for a long time and I thought to myself,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
if she had been there before the referendum had come up I wouldn't have voted no at the second.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
But then of course we had another chance, so I voted the right way that time.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And I remember sitting up and watching the results coming in.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And I think the Rhondda results were coming in quite late.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And we were all, well what have we voted for, you know?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And it was yes, so yeah. I do remember that.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Yeah, I remember the celebrations about that.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But I suppose television had an influence then to the extent that it was sort of, it did influence me on which way to vote the first time.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I don't think it influenced me the second time I think, Mrs Thatcher did that.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
But it was interesting to see.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And I always wished they had a DVD or a video of the results coming in because the excitement was really tense and dramatic.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And it was very good.
