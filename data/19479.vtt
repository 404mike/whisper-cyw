00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
To Autumn by John Keats. Read by Nicholas Shaw for the BBC.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:14.880
Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness, Close bosom friend of the maturing sun,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.600
Conspiring with him how to load and bless with fruit The vines that round the thatch eaves run,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.880
To bend with apples the mossed cottage trees, And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.120
To swell the gourd and plump the hazel shells with a sweet kernel,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.920
To set budding more and still more later flowers for the bees,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.880
Until they think warm days will never cease, For summer has o'er brimmed their clammy cells.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.880
Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store? Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find thee

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.400
sitting careless on a granary floor, Thy hair soft lifted by the winnowing wind,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.560
Or on a half-reaped furrow sound asleep, Drowsed with the fume of poppies,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.560
While thy hook spares the next swath and all its twine'd flowers,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.280
And sometimes like a gleener thou dost keep steady thy laden head across a brook,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.880
Or by a cider press with patient look Thou watchest the last oozing hours by hours.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.280
Where are the songs of spring? Ay, where are they?

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:38.560
Think not of them, thou hast thy music too. While barred clouds bloom the soft dying day,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.120
And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue, Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.880
Among the river sallows, born aloft or sinking As the light wind lives or dies,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:59.760
And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly borne, Hedge crickets sing, and now with treble soft

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.320
The red-breast whistles from a garden croft, And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.
