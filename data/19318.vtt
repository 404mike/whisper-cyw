00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
To a Traveler by Lionel Johnson

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Recorded by Robert Garrison

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And dedicated to the memory of Larry Ingalls

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The mountains and the lonely death at last,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Upon the lonely mountains, O strong friend,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The wandering over and the labor past,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Thou art indeed at rest, Earth gave thee of her best,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
That labor and this end.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Earth was thy mother and her true son thou,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Earth called thee to a knowledge of her ways.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Upon the great hills, up the great streams now,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Upon Earth's kindly breast, thou art indeed at rest.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Thou and thine arduous days.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Fare thee well, O strong heart,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The tranquil night looks calmly on thee,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And the sun pours down, his glory over thee,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
O heart of might.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Earth gives thee perfect rest,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Earth whom thy swift feet pressed,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Earth whom the vast stars crown.
