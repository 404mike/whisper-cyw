WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.920
My name's Jewel Willie. It's the 12th of March 2024 and I'm at the home of Mr. Ron Stokes,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.720
where he lives near Howey. So Ron, thanks very much for agreeing to have a chat with

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:21.160
me. First of all, Ron, I've got to ask you this question. What's your year of birth?

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.720
My year of birth is 4th of the 6th, 1924.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.040
My word. We'll work it out from there then. And where were you born, Ron?

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.520
I was born near St. DeWolder in a little place called Cap-a-Lon.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.800
So would that be Shropshire?

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.000
Shropshire, yeah.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.920
And what do you remember of your early years? Were you born on a farm?

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.640
No, I was born in a little cottage, you know, where my father was employed by the owner of the

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.400
farm. I see. And what do you remember of your early years growing up in the cottage?

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:08.800
I remember quite a lot really. I remember having pneumonia when I was about 3 to 4.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.560
I can remember in those days the horses and wagons going down to the harvest,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:25.760
collecting the harvest. And because my father was a wagoner, I thought, well, unlucky I was to be

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:33.600
laying in bed, you know, not able to enjoy myself riding on one of the wagons, you know.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.320
I see. And what do you remember about the cottage itself, where you were born and grew up?

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:51.920
It was a very small cottage, you know, just about one room and a big landing up and that was it.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.320
And did you have many friends in Shropshire? Was it a village, a small village?

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.320
Yes, a small village, yes.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.160
I see. So where would the nearest place be?

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.320
Nearest place would be Knighton or Bucknell or Llan.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.800
You know, either of those were about almost equal distances apart, you know.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.400
And what was it like growing up in a fairly rural area like that? What sort of things did you do

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.520
when you were a young boy? In those days, there were very few.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:38.560
I grew up in a car to the village. We grew up in French, played games like hounds and heirs and

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:48.080
things like that, you know. And generally played in the big thing with a football match between

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:56.480
our school and the next school down from Bucknell down. And we took part in that like.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.720
And what about school days? Did you have a school in the village?

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:10.320
A school in the village was a Church of England school. It was a teacher for two sisters

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:17.440
from Upper Chapel in Breconwy. And they were very good teachers

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:26.480
and interested in anything you were. And if you were good, they really had it most things like,

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.920
you know, they were quite helpful, crowded indeed.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.160
Oh, that sounds good. And then when you moved on, say, to secondary school,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.600
did you go to a secondary school in the area? No, I didn't go to secondary school.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.320
I see. We moved from Chapelona up to Dulley, which is

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:56.560
and Benny born to Blenver. And the other schoolmaster was very strict and kept us in order.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:04.640
So you went to school in Dulley, did you? Yeah, the one which is now the little old one,

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.960
which I think is a converted house. We came up when I was aged 11, you know, and

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:21.280
and that was I took 11 plus and I passed, but I didn't go to school because in those days from

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:30.080
there, you had to go to Bishop's Castle to the school there, like, you know, and anyway, that was it.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:40.080
How are we doing? We're doing fine. And did your people move onto a farm? Did they? In Dulley?

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:48.640
Did you move to live in a farm in Dulley? We moved to live with my parents on a small farm, you know,

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:59.040
and I spent all my school days in Dulley and that was it. I see. And what sort of a farm was it?

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:09.600
A sheep farm? A small farm. During wartime, of course, you had to sew crops that, you know,

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:18.480
you would normally look at everybody had to grow so many much more acreage of potatoes, for example,

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:25.600
you know, and things like that and cereal crops, you know, so that they could feed

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:37.200
animals with it rather than depend on imported stuff. So what was life on the farm like for you,

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.520
Ron? Did you have your jobs? Did you have your chores? Is that where you worked?

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:49.840
Did you have your jobs and your chores? Oh, yeah. Water was fetched from a well, you know,

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:56.560
for household use, you know, things like that. We all had to help, you know, and do a bit

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.320
where we could, you know. What was the name of the farm? The Mountain Farm.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.240
The Humminest Farm.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:12.320
The Mountain Farm. Right, right. What else did you have to do on the farm then? Were you busy

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:19.920
with the animals? We took part in most things like harvesting, you know, and everything involved with

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.720
the farm, you know. Children who grew up on a farm were usually involved in this quite a bit.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.040
And most things like that.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.960
That's right. And the community of Dali itself, was it quite a close community? Did you have many

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:43.760
friends? Well, they were scattered in those days. Of course, everybody had to travel by a cycle,

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:51.760
you know, and that sort of thing. And they didn't get together as they could have done. In the

00:06:52.400 --> 00:07:00.000
summertime, the lads used to gather at the local village hall and they played arts or something

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.760
like that. I see. Right. Did you ever go into any other bigger towns for entertainment and fun?

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:16.880
Not in those days, no. Entertainment was nothing until I was a teenager and, you know, I'd go to

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:26.800
cinema at Lendard and also the playhouse at Lendard, which was run by a company that was

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:35.680
sort of organised by a local cross-gate man. He had property in Cross-Gate, I should say.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:44.080
That sounds a bit of fun. And then, when did you, I understand you were an AA

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:51.280
person. Yeah. When did you join the AA? Before I left school.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:05.120
Hi. Sorry about that. That's all right. Sorry about that. Right, we'll start again.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:12.800
You're fine. But when you left school? When I left school, yes. I went to work on a farm,

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:19.280
you know, and I could work it over as well, you know, to help with the farm. And

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.480
I left school when I was fourteen and I went to the farm and I was there for thirteen years

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:37.680
working on that, you know. And I progressed from sort of the smaller young, the jobs they give to

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:45.840
the younger lads and to the, then I finished up driving the tractors and the caterpillar,

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.480
caterpillar tractor.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.760
You were talking about tractors, I believe, Ron. Perhaps you could embellish on that a little bit.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:01.040
I finished up there at the farm, you know, for the last three or four years driving the caterpillar

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:07.840
tractors, which were working on what they called reclaimed ground, you know, mountain sides ploughed

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:15.440
up, you know, and kind of the, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:23.680
mountain sides ploughed up, you know, and cultivated and new seeded grass was on them

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:32.960
and of course more productive than the old firner, brecon and that, you know, so. And at

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:46.000
the end of 1958 I thought I'd try another job. I joined the AA in that period and I went to

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:56.960
nothing more than a training course and three weeks and I came, I served with the AA then for

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:03.520
37 years, a correction, 35 years and seven months.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:10.880
You've got that exactly, haven't you? Yes. And where were you based? Were you just based locally?

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:18.720
Home based, from my home, you know, and just in the, Pennybunk when I started,

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:25.680
first road I went over was the Reader to Kington Road and then of course I went on

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:37.760
St. Paul's in there and I went on to recovery business in 1974 and I shut the door.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.920
Right, when you first started, Ron, can you remember when you first started in the AA?

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:51.520
I'm sure it was very different then from how it is now. Were you patrolling on a motorbike then?

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:57.120
On a motorbike in St. Charles, yeah. That was what they called the road service outfit in those days.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.880
Then, you know, through the bad winters over the random forests, you know, when

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:13.200
drifts of snow could be, they were one year 18 feet deep, which takes a bit of following today.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:21.120
And you had to patrol the roads and be out and about and give a road weather report

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:27.280
by eight o'clock in the morning, get it into the car, they put it in like so. You had to keep moving.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.560
And these reports, Ron, were they done by radio or by telephone?

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:37.600
No, they had to be done by telephone, you know, in the early days, like, you know, yeah.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:43.200
So what was your job then to patrol and see, you know?

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:49.920
You had to, first of all, road conditions, you know. The main job of a patrol was,

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:57.680
looking after the association's members who were, and if they were broken down, you did your best to

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:04.720
help them and get them back on the road again and that was it.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:09.840
And how did you know if they were actually broken down? What communication was there?

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.960
In the early days, it was by chance or somebody would come along and say,

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.320
there's somebody broken down along the area, you know, that sort of thing.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.040
And that's it.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:31.200
And in the case of perhaps a serious mishap, presumably you had to work then with the other

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.120
emergency services, did you?

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:40.560
Any serious mishap happened over the days. You know, you combined with the,

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:46.320
you assisted the police, you know, fire brigade, everything like that.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:13:00.400
And it was just like, you know, and then of course, the years went by that service

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:08.640
improved and progressed, you know, and you were doing recovery jobs.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:16.800
They introduced this service, which when a member was broken down, if he couldn't get him going,

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:25.200
he was relayed or recovered to his home address or, you know, or a garage, wherever he went, he'd go.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:31.680
So in the early days, Ron, he really had no immediate contact, did you? I mean,

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.920
there were no such things as mobile phones.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:43.280
Not in those days, no. Later on, as the years went by, we went on to radios, you know,

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:51.200
but in any area such as this, the reception was pretty good, but, you know, we had to put our own

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:56.960
mast up for it, you know, and do it that way. Where was the mast? On the Radnor Forest?

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:03.760
No, the mast was on Babur Wood at Leneglus, over that way.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:13.120
I see. And occasionally we'll see an old AA box, as we call them. Now, they used to be very prolific,

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.600
I remember, when I was younger. What function exactly did they have?

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:27.040
Well, that was a function. They had a telephone in it, and there was a list of all places of the assistance they could get,

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:36.480
and it was lit up at night by the old Tilly or Aladdin lamps, you know, and they were the

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:43.760
responsibility of the patrol on the road to make sure that lamp was lit, so if a member broke down

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:50.400
in that area, you know, and there was something there he could walk to, and the phone, of course,

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:58.560
where he could contact and get further out. And was this service available 24 hours?

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:09.040
24 hours of service to all its members, you know. So when you went to somebody's assistance, you had to

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:16.080
carry all your tools, presumably, with you? When we went to somebody's assistance, we had the tools in

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:24.400
this headcar portion, box portion, and that's all the tools in there, and that was it, like, you know.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:33.280
I see. And can you recall any particular incidences? Do any incidences stand out in your mind

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:39.760
that you had to attend? Well, I remember being on a job in Merthyr

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:49.120
and doing the work there, and I stripped the carburettor down on the roadside, and, you know,

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:58.880
just in the back of my van, and I was getting all spread out there, and, you know, seeing this carburettor,

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:07.840
there was a blockage tucked away in one of the little ports of the carb, and then to my order,

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:15.120
a mass of people came out, the bingo had finished up the road, and they came and they were

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:22.880
streaming down into town, and they were going, and I thought, heavens above, they were dodging down

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:30.080
the side of my van, and I thought, I'm gonna be lucky if I have half the parts to complete this job.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.320
And did you manage? Oh, I could have started out, yeah.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:41.840
Yeah, you know, with the job of being, when you had to, you know, improvise and, you know, make do,

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:50.480
you know, with what you could find to fix it, you know, all sorts of things like you do, you know,

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:58.400
you'd use a prep, you know, if you wanted a clip or anything, you know,

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:08.640
and I know there's lots of things you could do, like, and, like, if you were to leak in petrol tank,

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:15.520
you know, you'd get it in, the petrol would be pouring out, but you'd have to

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:24.240
jack the vehicle up as high as you could to send the petrol, the fluid that was in the tank

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:32.560
to the front of the tank, and then I'd get a self-tapping screw with fiber water and a cement,

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:40.960
you know, and tighten that into the tank, and it stopped leaking, and they could go on their way up

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:49.520
and get seen to it for opportunity. So, above all, you had to be versatile, I'm sure.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:57.840
You were, okay, you mentioned Mirth at Sidville now, you were obviously sent further afield.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:09.520
Oh, yes, but when the service was better known and people used to use it, you could find yourself

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:17.680
anywhere, you know. I'd be around at night, you know, on an evening shift, and then there were

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:26.720
night jobs in the evening, you know, and you'd be running late, and we'd get to some people's houses,

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:34.000
and they would insist that you have a coming in every couple of days, and, you know, and they would

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.680
say to me, how far are you going to go home? And I would mention my own town of Landon, where I'd

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:47.040
moved to, and then, and I'd say, they'd say, you poor lad, you're going to go all that way home,

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:54.400
surely you could stay down here for the night. And did you, did you often stay? No, I never stayed,

00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:02.480
I always went back home, in many cases, yeah, and in the recovery business, when we were in the

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:10.560
Lourdes, you know, we'd get Lourdes, and, you know, and we went from the motorcycle accommodations to

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:23.920
minivans, then on to, to bigger vans like Transits, and then, of course, we went, with the recovery

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:31.680
service, we had Land Rovers, and the Transit, the one in 19th, you know, which were a bigger van,

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:39.200
and also Lourdes, you know, Ford, Transit, Traders, and that sort of thing, you know,

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.480
and Bedford, and you'd land up, yeah.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:51.360
Yes, things certainly moved on, and do you remember anything else that happened of note,

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.560
any other jobs? Again, you've mentioned the Merther one, you know, there must be a few more.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:05.120
I can remember starting from Beulah, with a vehicle on board, a lady wanted to go to a gold

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:12.400
and wedding anniversary celebration in Manchester, you know, she'd broken down, and

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:19.440
I started off from Beulah, went all the way to Clowes Top, which is the Kidderminster,

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:29.760
you know, Budely Road, like that, and I found myself suddenly in snow, and here it covered the

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:37.280
clentils, and there were drifts up to two and a half to three foot deep in places, and I went over

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:44.320
the top, and knowing what could be any of me, and it was, you know, the road completely blocked with

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:52.480
traffic, six cars, either over the edge or on top of the edge between there,

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:59.040
and Budely, sort of a distance of three miles, and I landed up in Birmingham, all right,

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:06.960
I got there, and that's what it's like. I got into Birmingham, and the superintendent in charge of

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:14.400
the district had shut the Birmingham depot down completely, because he considered it was

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:22.080
hazardous, you know, to go outside, and he offered to put me up in a hotel for the night, and I said,

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:28.240
well, I said, you know, I would like to try and get back home, because my colleague who was doing

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:33.760
the night shift was coming on, who'd worked the lorry, and he said, well, I'll leave it entirely

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:42.560
after you, and so off I went, and joined the motorway, and driving blizzard, there was snow,

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.640
went down there so far, beginning to think I've made a mistake here,

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:56.080
but I went on down, came off at Worcester, and went through Worcester to go over Bromir Downs,

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:06.240
and then I ran into the snow, well, not the snow so much, it was the vehicles were all

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.880
parked up, couldn't make it over there, that's what it stopped, I could have gone over there,

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:19.840
and anyway, halfway through the evening, we were standing around waiting for the

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:26.560
ploughs to come and open it up, a fellow in the lorry said to me, I could get over there, he said,

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:34.400
I know if it's a road, it'll remain clear, but I said, well, if you won't have a go, I said,

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.960
I'll come behind you, I said, but I'll leave you plenty of distance, I said, you know,

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:47.520
he got to the very top, just about another 20 yards to go, and a car that was parked after

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.120
pulled out in front of him, and stopped him straight away, we all had to reverse

00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:03.040
back to the end of the queue, and we reversed down there, and I thought, well, this is no use,

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:08.960
we're not going to be here clear for another two or two and a half hours by what the news was, so

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:18.640
anyway, I knew the area well, I knew there was a farmhouse, I thought, if I have a word with

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:26.880
somebody who could point me where the driveway to the, across common wet ground is, could point me

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:33.280
to that, I said, I could reverse into it, and turn around and go back to Worcester, and come down to

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:41.600
Ledbury, turn off your strength, and turn there, which I did, and anyway, I met the old farmer, and

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:50.880
he said, you aim for between those two rush, rush bushes, you know, and he said, that's the road

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:58.000
comes between those, so I did that, and it was a wave, but it was pretty hard going there, but

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.760
once I got to Ledbury, it was clear, yeah. Well, you've certainly had some interesting

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:12.000
experiences, a bit hairy. Oh, I have a few. You have. You must, during your career there, you must have met some

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.720
interesting characters. Are there any people who sort of stand out, people that you dealt with, helped, etc.?

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:28.960
Well, I dealt with one or two. I met with the Russell Grant once, and then I met with Philip Maddock,

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:39.920
you know, and he, I told him, and he drove, he steered his wife's car to a garage in

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:46.880
Abergavenny, so that, you know, they'd do what was necessary in a few days. Next,

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:53.760
there's a Gilbert show, it was from, you know, so, oh, but, you know,

00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:04.240
the two runnies used to be about years ago, Coedians, remember those? I did. And I met the,

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:14.880
the more serious one, the younger one, and he had a truck problem with his car, and I fixed that for him,

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:21.840
so, you'll bet I've got a few. Well, you certainly have. You've met up with quite a few famous,

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:29.120
well-known people, haven't you? Yes. And you always tried to get home to, to Llandrindod, whenever

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:35.120
you caught. Oh, yeah, I would. I'd always get back, give the way for about two hours out, you know,

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.920
and say, well, look, I've eaten, and, or you look, where is it? Yes, where are you now?

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:46.160
Well, you've certainly been very, very well travelled. You've mentioned Manchester and

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:54.560
Merthyr. Where's the furthest you ever had to go to, to assist? Well, the furthest that I

00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:02.320
think I ever to any cooking miles was during the fuel shortage when the Cuba crisis was on.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:12.000
That was the, because I couldn't get fuel around Bristol area, the Bristol depot was almost,

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:19.360
had a standstill, you know, but because I got petrol on board, it wanted me to go to pick up a

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:29.520
vehicle on a very cold freezing night, and it was between, supposed to be between Gloucester

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:43.600
and, you know, at the Tembury Wells. It was a place, anyway, I went there,

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:51.680
and I kept going, I couldn't find this vehicle anywhere. And we were all in our areas,

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:58.960
regardless of snow conditions, but round the area, and the black mountains, they had quite a bit of

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:12.960
snow. And I landed up near enough in Oxford, you know, along the old A40, trying to find this person

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:20.400
and I finally found them on the return trip, and they were tucked away around, they found a narrow

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:26.400
road and got down, it was a bit of a waste ground on the side of the road, a way up the road,

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:35.680
completely, but that was it, like, I got them and we had to boil water on East Amphur Band,

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:45.360
which I went out to it then to free my wraps, which were frozen solid on the vehicle.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:52.640
Well, you've certainly had a lot of adventures, haven't you, or perhaps misadventures,

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:58.880
you've mixed with the rich and famous, you've been all over the place. Did you enjoy your

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:03.120
retirement in Llandrindod? Did you? You retired to Llandrindod?

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:14.400
Sure, I retired in 1994, and I enjoyed my retirement, I spent it going on holidays,

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:22.400
quite a lot, although I'd done a fair bit before, I think I'd covered most areas of the British

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:28.560
House, including the Sillies, you know, and the Arctic and Shetland and those like, and

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:33.840
so I've enjoyed my retirement. Well, that's absolutely fine.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.640
Now, I believe, Ron, you started saying something about two damsels in distress,

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.960
would you like to enlarge on that, when they lost something?

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:54.560
Well, it's a bit of a funny subject, really.

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:05.440
These two damsels, we had to call late in the afternoon to go to a course that the keys had

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:17.600
been lost, and I decided to go myself out to the job, because I thought I was a bit more able to

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:27.120
deal with it than the Llandrindod available, and I went out to it, and I went and I published two

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:34.160
young ladies, very attractive ladies, very smartly dressed, you know, and a course, 911, you know,

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:42.080
and which is a sports car, you know, and which to my surprise contained a radio and all in,

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:48.320
you know, radio communication. I don't know what job they did, you know, and I said,

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:56.080
tell me what, I always like to cover what happened before they found it, you know, when they've been,

00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:06.960
she said, well, they've been out with two fellows to a pub in Llandr, and they were coming back with

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:14.320
a carafal vine, trying to keep it from spilling, and anyway it fell and it broke,

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:22.960
and they disposed of the glass over the edge, right, well that's not a very good thing to do,

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:30.640
like with animals, you know, but she said they're there, and they had the place, they had the local

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:44.160
garage, you know, Lenovo, you know, Robin, the boy's name, I forget his name now, but

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:51.040
Falconers, they were, do you remember him? Yes, I do. And they'd been out to them, they couldn't do

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:57.440
anything except smash the window, they said, you know, a poor sport car, they didn't want to do that,

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:07.360
you know, but they wanted to get home, and I, if I remember rightly, I said to them, well,

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.800
let's get them over, I said, what about these two fellows, I said, where are they now?

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:22.320
Oh, they'd gone early that morning back home, I said, have you been in contact with them, you know,

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:30.560
got the keys off them, got the knowledge of where they think the keys were, and they got them with

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:39.600
them, you know, no, they'd got them with them, they didn't know, anyway, I said to them, well,

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:47.680
I said, they were staying in a little tiny building alongside the old mill, like,

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:54.080
you didn't know it did, and they were there, and they,

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.440
said, and it contained one room up, and just the landing upstairs, like,

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:10.000
I said, well, the first thing I did, we searched from the car and all around the ground,

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:19.520
I said, have you searched upstairs, like, no, we didn't, no, downstairs we searched, no, nothing

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:26.320
there, and anyway, I said, well, let's go upstairs, well, there's nothing up there, she said, there's

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:33.760
only like a flat landing, and then, you know, and then nothing there, and I said, well, let's have

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:39.600
a look anyway, and I was going around from corner to corner to check in, and I picked

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:47.520
all the way with an old rusty tin, you know, and I knew straight away that there was something heavier

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:53.120
than what should normally be in that tin, and I said, hang on, I said, oh, she said, don't touch

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:59.440
that, there's a rat poison in there, rat poison in there, I said, well, is there something else here as

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:04.400
well, and we moved to the window, and I said, look, I opened it, and there were the keys inside.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:15.840
So, Ron, you turned detective as well. So, we went over there, and I tried to get a fast

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:23.120
search of keys from Port in London in between that, you know, to send them down, and, but no joy,

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:30.880
nothing under three days before it would get to that awful, and I was there, she said, oh,

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:41.440
that's a blingin' blow, boy, she said, did that, and she said to her friend, they ratted on us,

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:49.680
they said, last night, something, they did this bit of a hapset over, and so she got on the phone,

00:33:49.840 --> 00:34:00.240
she didn't have to strip off. She said, I think, she said, you'll be having bills from the police,

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:07.680
she said, we're wasting time, and also the garage, we're wasting time, and she said, I don't know

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:15.760
what they're gonna charge us, but they were glad to, and I saw them safely on their way, and that was it,

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:21.280
but over there's so many things you could tell, like, you know, I'm sure, yes,

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:27.120
you could write a book on it, indeed, it would be a very interesting book as well,

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:34.640
my word, my word, and how many AA men were actually based where you were in your section?

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:45.360
In this area of London as well, we had an inspector, and he had one man in Llandud,

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:54.880
myself, out of Dolly to start, and another boy up at London, Badron, one in Bill, sorry,

00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:06.640
and then there's one in Reader as well, and that was more or less it, for this particular area,

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:16.400
and that's a part of an area of Aberystwyth where they got eight patrols over there, and there were

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:26.960
six in Newtown area, which weren't for us to start, but joined us later on,

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:33.840
yeah, so they got a lot of patrols in those days, you know, and we always think what we did to the

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:42.640
others did to Badron. Well, things have certainly changed, haven't they? Yes, indeed. Well, Ron,

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:50.560
thank you very, very much indeed for your time and for all these fascinating stories, my word,

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:55.840
like you say, you could write a book, you know, you've had a really very interesting life, haven't

00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:02.800
you? Right, well, thank you very much, Ron, I'm very, very pleased we've been able to do this at

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:06.960
long last. Okay, thank you very much.
