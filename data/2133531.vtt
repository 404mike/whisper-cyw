00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Okay, Monday the 19th of June, 2012, part two of interview with Kimberly Chapman.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Okay, Kim, can you tell us what a week at Chapstom NCAP looks like for you?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So starting with Monday.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Pop-up cafe.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Pop-up cafe. So that's on a Tuesday, but on a Monday you do the prep for it?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Yeah, we do it on Monday.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Okay, what does that involve?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Cookery and washing up, wiping up.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Yeah?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
All that. Put it through the dishwasher and...

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
What type of things do you cut?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Chocolate cake and...

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Yeah?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Lots of cakes!

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And that's to be served at the cafe that we do?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Yeah. On a Tuesday.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Nice. Do you enjoy doing that?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Yeah.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
What else do you do on the Monday? Do you come in for the Tuesday as well?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
No, no.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So you just do the prep?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I do the prep.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Because Kim works on the Tuesday.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So you never actually see...

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Yeah!

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And next time you get a day off work...

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Yeah, I am going to come in and eat some of the cake you made.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Yeah, I will! Don't worry!

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Well, I can tell you everybody loves the cakes that you enjoy.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Thank you!

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I work Tuesday morning so I never get to see it either.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Oh, that's okay.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So that's two of us.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Oh, I would like...

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Everyone tells me how lovely the cakes are.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Okay, like...

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Nice!

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So you're obviously quite active. You like doing a lot of work then.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Aside from work, what do you do as hobbies? Like leisurely stuff. What do you like?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Walking...

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Down to Sammy and...

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Who's Sammy?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The fish! By the riverbank!

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The seal!

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Oh yeah.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So often when you're at the board school you wander down the riverbank.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Yes, lovely.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We are very lucky with the location back here, aren't we?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
We are lucky.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So for the people that will be listening to this, do you want to tell them what it looks like around here? Where we're based?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
By the board school.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So we're at the board school.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And we walk down to the riverbank to the board school.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Yeah, and what are we looking out on opposite the board school?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
The castle.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So we're in a very beautiful area, aren't we?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
We are.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Actually, you come here and you see Chepstow Castle.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
But what's in Caldecott where you live?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Caldecott Castle!

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Which one's better?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
You're not saying it.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I'm not saying! Me and my mum!

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Do you walk better around Caldecott Castle?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
You want to see how high it is in Caldecott Castle.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Right.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Good views, isn't it?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Yeah, I did see it! I did see it on the notes actually.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
You coming?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Dinner, I have to...

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Dinner.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
You don't know, is it?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
It's a picnic in a medieval castle.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Come along.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
It's going to be fun.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I'll make a good picnic as well, I can show you as well.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
It's like one of your social evenings.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Yeah, we've got a few social evenings coming up.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
We've got a picnic at Caldecott Castle.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
We've got a meal out on the boat.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
We have...you okay?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Yeah, I'm okay.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
You went into deep eye contact with her.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
What else have we got coming up?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
She's probably concentrating on the...

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
She was, you were deep in thought.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I was!

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
What were you thinking about? It looked like a...

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I don't know, man! I was like that.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Yeah, we've got a few things coming up.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Oh well, so you're lucky...

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Yeah, I am!

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
...to go between two castles, come on!

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Yeah, I know, come on!

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Not many people who get a choice of castle now, is there?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
No, right.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
So you've just said that you do the preparation at the Pop-Up Cafe, that's on a Monday.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Tuesday you go to work.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Sometimes you join in with social evenings because do you remember what we used to do on a Thursday night?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Fashion shows.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Fashion shows, but what else did we used to do? Were you part of the cookery group?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Yes.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And what are your memories from that? Can you remember meeting anyone famous?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
There's lots, aren't there? Loads of people.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Yeah.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Did you meet someone famous down the drill hall one night?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Oh yeah, Nick Nolmes.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
That's right.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
You like him, don't you?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
It's funny.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So how was it meeting him?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
It was good.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
He was doing a book signing.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Yeah, book signing!

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
On one of his cookbooks.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Yeah, Nick Nolmes!

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
You'd been using his cookbook to make some recipes, isn't that right?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Yeah.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And he came over and had a chat with you all, didn't he?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Yeah, it was good.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Nice.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And a photo.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And a photo.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
He was very nice, actually.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Yeah, he was.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
I thought he was a bit dishy, actually.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Would you agree?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
I don't think Kim agrees at this stage.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Keep your mouth shut, don't you?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Oh.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
So what else did you used to do on a Thursday night? Where did we used to go all together?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
I used to go...

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Oh, go...

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
What did the other one say?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Do you remember the name of the pub in Bourg?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
We've been to the two brewers, yes.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
We've had meals there, haven't we?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Yeah.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
But the other one was called...

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
If you can't remember, it was...

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
The two brewers?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
The burnt barn club.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
The burnt barn club, yeah.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And what did we used to do there?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Everything there.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Yeah, like what? What did they used to put on for us there?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Buffet and drinks and...

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
She's got it!

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
It was quiz night, wasn't it?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Quiz night and darts and skittles and...

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
We keep saying we used to, we're still doing this stuff, you know, but it's just evolved in a way, hasn't it?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
It's a different way of working now, kind of.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
What do you mean?

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Well, it was always...it looks a lot different now, doesn't it?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Yeah.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
We don't have the transport, so a lot of things is you guys finding your own way there.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Yeah, I mean...

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
So things have changed. Some things have become more difficult, but I think also with like...

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
some independence has come for some of you guys, which is nice.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Yeah.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Also, do you have a boyfriend, Kim?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Yeah.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Who is your boyfriend?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Adrian Heath, no.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Now, is it?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Now, yeah.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
We interviewed him the other day, actually.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Did you?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
We did.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Oh.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
So how did you meet Adrian?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Uh-huh.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Secrets as well.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Yeah. He came to my 40th party.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
So he came to your 40th and how old are you now?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
41 now.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Oh, right. Okay.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
I think...yeah.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Yeah?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
I was in a green dress.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Well, of course you were in a green dress. You're sat there in a green dress now.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
I like it.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
You love green, don't you?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
I don't think I've ever seen you in anything other than green.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Certainly your favourite colour, isn't it?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
So you're going to...

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
It matches your eyes.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Yeah, Mike.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
So tell us about you. Tell us about Kim's life.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Because it's not all about Chepst and Lancap.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Right.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
So where...do you know where you were born?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
In an hospital.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Ask silly questions, get silly answers.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Yeah, Mike. Get silly answers.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So where was the hospital, do you know?

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Will Grant, I expect.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Yeah. Same as me.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Oh, my God.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Have you always grown up in Cardiff?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Yes.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Yeah? Where did you go to school?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Cardiff Comprehensive.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Did you?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Yeah, really? Oh, right. I got a few Nates over there.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
They probably remember you.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
I was naughty.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Oh, really? Tell us a little bit.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
No, you don't want to know, Mike.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
I was on report, Mike.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Was you?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Yeah.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Tell us about that.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
We like the juicy details.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
What were you on report for?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
For being naughty and going...

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Not doing maths.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Not doing maths.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Nobody likes maths today.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I don't like maths, Mike.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So did you enjoy school?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Not really, Mike.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
No?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
No.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
What made you not enjoy it?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Didn't like it, Mike.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Not your thing?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Not my thing, Mike.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
I didn't like school either.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
All right, so you're not...

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I'm not the only one.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
No, you're not the only one.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
I didn't like school at all.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
I was too shy.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
I didn't particularly like maths.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And Michael certainly didn't like maths.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
It's not my forte.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
But I loved school.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
So it's funny, isn't it? Different people have different experiences.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Waves. Yeah.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Yeah.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
I really enjoyed school.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So then you went from school.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Where did you go then?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Went to Nash.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Nash College? Yeah.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
What did you study there?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Everything there. They've got a bungalow and swimming and leisure centre and everything.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Was there a life skills course?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Yes.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
You should say that.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Margaret Price. Do you know her?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
I do know that name.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
But I don't know why I know that name.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
She's the head of...

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Skills.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Yeah.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
What type of things did you learn there?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Maths, English,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Cookery,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Leisure Centre,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Everything.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Wow.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Those kind of skills for you to live as independently as possible.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Yeah. English, everything.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
It's a coping life. Yeah.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Do you feel you've learnt a lot there?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Yeah.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Making a bed and...

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Yeah. Things that you need in life.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Yeah.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Rather than algebra.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
So it was practical stuff then.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Yeah.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
How did you get to Nash?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
M&R took us.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Taxi.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Right.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Was it just you in the taxi?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
No. It was Lollivet.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And he broke down one day.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
What happened then?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
There was me having a dimmy fit on the side of the road.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And it was like this.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Did you have to push the van?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
No. He had to ring somebody.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Yeah.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Oh wow. That's when your life skills come in handy.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Changing a tyre or whatever.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
He had to ring somebody, the man.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
So you said you enjoyed Nash College.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Yeah.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Do you feel you learnt more there than you did in school?

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Yeah.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I think that's very important thing for people to realise that sometimes

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
learning the practical skills of life is a lot more important than learning the academic theory.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Theory.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
So after Nash,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Yeah.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
You went to college.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Yeah.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
After Nash.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Where does Kim go then in her life?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
What happens after Nash College?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Come here I think.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Right.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Was there a period in between?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Don't think so.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
No? Just out of college?

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And joined Chepstam and Kat.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Yeah. Because I love you.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
We love you too.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I know it can be the pain but Jesus.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
We're not in pain at all mate.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
We all just work in different ways don't we?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Yeah mate.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Yeah mate.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
So would you like to ask

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
what we've done with some of the interviews so far.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Yeah.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
We give you the opportunity to interview me and Sue if you'd like to.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
What should I say?

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
That's totally up to you.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
That's the whole point of this part.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
It comes from you.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
You can ask us anything.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
You can ask us anything. We make sure you're comfortable.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
We can ask you anything.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
We might not answer it but we'll try our best.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Alright mate.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
What do you like?

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
What do I like? Elvis.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
What do you like?

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Not Elvis.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Alright then mate.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
What do I like in anything?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Yeah anything at all.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
I like music.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Alright yeah.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And I'll be in a field on Werby Farm.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
I heard that.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Two days time I'll be at Glastonbury.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Oh you're going to that Michael?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
I am yeah.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Good luck on that then.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
So I might be a bit worse for where next week can work.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Next Monday.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Well no I'll be back in next Tuesday.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Tuesday.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Oh good job on Monday then.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
You wouldn't want to see me on next Monday.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
No.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Oh good job we've interviewed you today then.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
You know how it is then isn't it?

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
He's not going to be here.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
No he's not. We must remember that.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
You wouldn't get much sense out of me next Monday.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
So yeah that's one thing I really like is live music.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Yeah you do.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
I heard that Glastonbury was coming and I don't know if he's going to be on the road.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Have you seen it on the telly have you?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
No mate.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Have you ever been to a festival?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
I've been to a concert.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
What concerts have you been to?

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Rihanna.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Wow.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
I've been to Rihanna.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Yeah that's it I think.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Yeah Rihanna.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
You love Rihanna don't you?

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Yeah I love my Rihanna big time.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Where did you see her?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Yeah we were like this.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Mum was going I don't like this.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
I don't like this.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
I don't like this.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Was it in the principality?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
No.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
It's really steep isn't it?

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Mum didn't like it.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
No so steep.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
My mum don't like heights.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
If you're up in those seats it can be a bit

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
there to go.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
It gives you that feeling of

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
feeling sick doesn't it?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Doesn't it feel a bit unbent?

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
We were stood up.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Were you?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
We've got to stand for Rihanna really

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
haven't you to dance?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Yeah you can't do umbrellas like that

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
No!

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
So what else would you like to ask us?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
You've asked us what we love.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
What else

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
do you like doing?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
What do I like doing?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
I like

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
doing pottery.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
I like reading.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
I read quite a lot.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
What do

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
what's your favourite

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
food or favourite

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
food?

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Good question. My favourite food, I love food.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Probably my favourite food

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
is

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
something my

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
grandad always cooked for me.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
It's a very simple dish.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
It's certainly not caviar.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
What's that?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Egg bread and bacon.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Have you ever heard of egg bread?

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
French toasts.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
French toasts yeah I've got it.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
French toasts with bacon and some

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
beans or some ketchup.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
That's the best thing I could think of

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
as far as a meal.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
I like chicken

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
and I don't like cooking.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
And I can't cook.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Why?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
It just doesn't happen for me Kim.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
He can vouch for it.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
I've grown up eating no cooking

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
and it's never

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
got any better.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Oh dear Mike.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
She does try though.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Oh right.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
She makes a good steak

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Diane sauce.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
I give her that.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
That's one thing she's perfected.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
And providuals I can do.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
I know.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
So any other

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
questions you want to know about us?

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
No.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
No that's it.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
You've asked some lovely questions Kim.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
I know I have.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
You have.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
And I would like to say at the end of this now

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
thank you so much

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
for just dropping everything

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
and coming in here and doing this.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
You know on spec that was really

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
great.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
And I just want to ask you

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
have you enjoyed doing this with us?

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Yes it's good isn't it?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Yeah what have you enjoyed?

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Talking and stuff like that.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Yeah.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
And in this room do you like the room we're in?

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
I like the room.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Are you looking forward to the exhibition itself?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
I'm looking forward to seeing it.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Where the interviews will be

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
on display.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Where we can hear it.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
We're going to do some group work with you

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
soon where we start

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
planning on how we want the exhibition to look like.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Oh nice.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
So what we're going to do basically is

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
go back through the interviews with you.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Listen to your interview

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
and everyone else's with definition.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
See which bits you particularly like.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Which content we like

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
the stories.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
And then we'll build the exhibition around

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
things that you've discussed.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Oh nice.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
I'm looking forward to

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
going to Megaball

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
and having a meal out.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
When is that and who's that with?

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Here, here, here.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Yeah we've got a lot of things coming up

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
haven't we?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Oh that's the trip that you've chosen.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Because you were all given a choice

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
of about seven

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
things.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
And that's what you've chosen.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Yeah, to take the box.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Yeah I'm going to be coming bowling with you.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Ah lovely.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
I'm going to beat you.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
I'll beat my car.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
I'll beat you.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
But when you're going to?

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Err

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
say when you're going to.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Megaball.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
I'm leaving.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
I'll

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
thrash Michael.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
You're going to thrash Michael?

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Oh no.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
You're having the barriers up?

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Yeah. Cheat.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Why?

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
I'll play with the barriers down and then we'll see who wins.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
I'm a cheat in a way.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Well it's been lovely

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
talking to you Kim and thank you for your time.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Thank you so much Kim. That's been lovely.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Anything else you'd like to add?

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Anything else you want to ask now before we end?

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
No.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Any other questions? No.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Nothing? No.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
All good, all that's left to do is to say goodbye.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Bye. Bye bye.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Over for now. Bye.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Bye bye.
