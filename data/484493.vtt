Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Interviewee Anna Shaw.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The location of the interview is the Swicker office.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And today's date is the 6th of October 2015.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Anna, before we start, would you be kind enough to spell your name in full?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Anna A-N-N-A Shaw S-H-A-W.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Anna, I can remember you in your first Cardiff Carnival way back in 1994.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
What first attracted you to the carnival camp, which at that point was in Cattays Community Centre.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And I think you lived locally then, didn't you?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Yeah, a bunch of my friends were involved.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I guess it was the first night party with the free food and social interaction over the summer holidays.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And that's how I got involved really.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
No, it's interesting you mentioned, because of course the launch parties, certainly at Cattays, which was a very sort of open social space.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I mean, I've interviewed some other people and they were saying, you know, it sounds very strange now,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
but, you know, there was a building where people would come after work, perhaps with a four pack.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
People would be smoking both inside and outside.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It was very much a sort of libertarian feel to it.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
That's, you know, in days, current days of health and safety and all the rest of it.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It really was a party.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I mean, it was very open and welcoming.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Yeah, I think everybody was welcome.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And of course, your first Cardacanel Parade in 1994, you got up on stilts, but this wasn't your first time on stilts, was it?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So can you remember when you first met stilts and what you ended up doing?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Yeah, I first got up on stilts back in quite a few years before that, probably about 10 years or so before that.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I'm trying to think, actually, maybe more than that.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000
But back in St Stephen's Theatre Space down the bay, which was run by Moving Being at the time,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and they'd set up the South Cardiff Youth Theatre.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Peter Waldridge was kind of directing that at the time, and he taught us all to stilt walk and stage combat and all sorts of other things.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
But yeah, I was one of Herod's soldiers on stilts.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I've actually seen that nativity, you know, Alishaw is Herod's stilt walking soldier.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I can see it in the programme now.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I was very mean.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Yes. So you'd been up on stilts.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Pete Waldridge, a fabulous name from Community Theatre in Cardiff, obviously ran that group.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And then many years later, you stumble upon the Cardiff Carnival in CotÃ©'s Community Centre.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And I'm imagining the tutors, part of our carnival team who taught you and took you through your paces and helped you build up your stamina again, were Kevin and Oggy.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Yeah.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And what was it like working with them? Because of course, they were Bristol based.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
They were stilt performers.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
That was how they primarily made their living, you know, so they were quite expert.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
What were they like as tutors?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I mean, what was it like to learn again?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
It was great fun.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I got involved with that.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I particularly remember making cardboard fashion victim clothes, actually.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
It was great fun.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And spending hours during the carnival procession on stilts, going around town.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I remember the fashion victims.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I think they were the following years.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And weren't they sort of like beatboxer-y type characters with...

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Yeah.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Yes. So it would have been you, Oggy.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Reese, do you remember her? Reese?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Reese and do you remember Cora?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Yeah.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So you were like a sort of posse.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And it was quite satirical as well.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
You were sort of gently taking the mickey out of your fashion, weren't you?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Absolutely. I had a cardboard pineapple hairdo.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I don't remember those being popular at any time.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
No.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I was not a very fashionable fashion victim.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
No, no. But I remember all your gear was actually made primarily out of cardboard,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
which was printed and painted and varnished.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Yeah. It looked very wonderful.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So you were actually up on stilts above the audience during the parade.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
What's that feel like?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
I mean, in terms of reception from the audience or even...

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Are your legs turning to jelly through striding around?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Yeah. I've always found it kind of easier to walk on stilts than on my own feet or on high heels.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
You're naturally a stilt walker by birth.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Yeah. It's that thing that you've got to keep your legs moving.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Right.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
You can't stop because if you stop, you fall over.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So you've just got to keep going.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Yeah.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And if you want to stop, you find a wall and lean against it.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
There's no other way.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
So it's a bit like the shark. I think I understand.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
It has to swim permanently to survive.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Yeah.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Stilt walkers are like the shark of the carnival world.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Yeah. You don't stop until you take them off.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I think I'm right in saying you never took a tumble. I don't remember...

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
No.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
No? Never came... Yes.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
I used to watch Kevin Dennis, one of the Jumbies, the stilt performers.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And one of the first things he used to say in a lesson was,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
if you are going to fall, make sure you don't fall backwards because there's no control.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And he'd practice bringing people down.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
He said you come down to your knees, then you come forward onto your hands or your elbows,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
hopefully onto skateboard pads, which would be on your knees and your elbow.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And that way it's all controlled.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And you've come down and it made total sense.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Rather than falling from a great height, it was like watching somebody collapse gently.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And under a very controlled manner.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
It does. It goes against your instincts because you have to go forwards.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Yes.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And you have to sort of bend your knees and then put your hands out.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And it's sort of... Yeah.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And the rest happens. Gravity does the rest for you.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Yeah.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Yes. So after a couple of years as a very accomplished stilt performer, I have to say,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
I can still in my mind's eye see you on parade.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
You then got a taste for drumming.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
There was a wonderful group run with a musical director, certainly Chris Gerling,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
who was deputy musical director of Samba Galiz at the time.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And it was called Rundamental.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Tell us a bit about Rundamental.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
It was fab.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
There was a lot of workshops leading up to it.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
There was like about six or eight weeks worth of, I think, two workshops a week or something leading up to it.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And lots of drumming, but lots of physical warm up as well.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And I remember never being so fit in my life as I was at the end of that.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And we ran around town for, I think, two hours or more.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Drumming and running constantly for the actual carnival.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And the troupe, I think, was probably as big as 20 or 30 people.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Yeah, it was huge.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And what was the look? Because it was a very distinctive look, I remember, as well.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
We were all black and white, kind of tribal looking stuff at the time.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And I remember running up to friends of mine sitting in town and they didn't even recognise us.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
So you're on parade, you're drumming in costume, and they've got no idea.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
No idea it was me at all.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
But yeah, it was great fun.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Yeah, we just ran and drummed for hours.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
I think it's one of the groups who really took to heart the whole, you know, yes, you can paint your face,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
but why don't we go for a total body look?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And I mean, you know, that bit which wasn't covered with specially printed designs in black and white seemed to be...

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Yeah, we were painted all over.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
You were painted all over, I can remember that.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I mean, and the whole group looked amazing.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And I had this frenetic energy because not only would you stop and drum, you'd then, like a unit, get up and run somewhere else and do it.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
I mean, there was a, I mean, Run Demential was well named.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
There was quite a high entry level, wasn't there?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
There was a fitness regime that you had to come twice a week.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Yeah, you did. You needed to.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Build up your stamina.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:15.000
But Chris obviously knew what he was doing because, yes, in fact, well, he went further down that line and he's now a professional fireman.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
You'll be glad to know, Alo, which for which you have to be very physically fit.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
So Chris has kept that up.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
I think you kept on the drumming in your next incarnation as a drummer.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
You weren't black and white.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
You were...

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Blue and gold.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Blue and gold.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Blue and gold.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And we didn't do quite so much fitness regime and running this time, but it's still a lot of drumming.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Excellent.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
I remember this time we went off from Cote's Community Centre again, I think.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Yeah. And then over the bridge, which I thought was a nice moment because I could look back and see how big the parade was and just think, wow, all these people coming together, you know, very, very special.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
It was smashing.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So that's you as an individual, as it were.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And then, of course, life intervenes and children and families emerge and you left Cardiff for a while.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
So certainly we weren't as accessible as we used to be.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.000
But then you're back and you're pregnant in a parade.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
What were you wearing?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
How did it feel to be carrying child whilst on a carnival parade?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:32.000
At that point, yeah, it was probably when I was the first of my sober carnival experiences.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
I was wearing some sort of jester thing.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
What was it? Some fool's thing.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Oh, I can see the feast of fools.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
The feast of fools was the carnival theme.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:50.000
We had rather colourful, not quite patchwork, but big colourful pantaloons with sort of, you know, one colour at the top and another colour on the left.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
I think they were quite... I would say they were harlequin-esque.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
I like the word, yeah.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Yeah, that's a very long word.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
But very colourful harlequins.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Yes.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Yeah, it was fun.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And the heat of summer.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Thankfully, I don't think I was too heavily pregnant at that point.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
I was about to ask how.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Yes, and of course we finished down in Cardiff Bay.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Before the WMC, the Welshman Ames Centre was even built at that point.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
It was still relatively early days for Cardiff Bay as a visitor destination.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
But again, a beautiful sunny day.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Everybody enjoyed themselves.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And as a mum of three now, of course you've still got contact with the Cardiff Carnival.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
We're back.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
All my kids have been in the carnival at some point in their pushchair.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
All decked out with bits of gold and whatever.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
At various different times.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And now the oldest one is 13 and the youngest one is five.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Wow.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
So last year she was in her pushchair.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
This year she wasn't.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000
She escaped.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And she was all over the place.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
It was quite scary.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
It was rugby international so it was absolutely packed.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Yeah, but yeah, it was fun.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
So that's the joys of actually being on parade with children who are perhaps a little over excited upon occasion.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I've been at my trial this year but it's nice.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And my middle son particularly really got enthusiastic about it when they came along last year.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
He didn't want to join in but once they were in the parade he couldn't wait to come back this year.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Absolutely.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Well, thank you for remembering and bringing us back all your carnival memories.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:51.000
I think it's worth saying that sort of Anna, you're one of the people who I associate with theatre and special events and participation in Cardiff because your involvement, you mentioned getting involved with Moving Being Theatre Company when you were very young.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Being part of South Cardiff Youth Theatre.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:12.000
And in fact, tell us before all that happened, Moving Being, who were very innovative theatre company undertook a project about the great storehouse of Welsh legends, the Mabinogion and that actually brought you to Cardiff initially.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Tell us more about that.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Yeah, I was about eight when the first one happened.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And I was in all the Mabinogions.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
They did four in total, I think.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
But I was eight when the first one happened and we were living in London.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
My mother got a part in the Mabinogion.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And so that brought us to Cardiff for a few months while we were performing in that.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And as one of the children of the cast I ended up sort of in the cast myself.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
As one does, there were escapes.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
We were kind of gypsy kids and mice in the third branch, which was very exciting.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
I think that was your...

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And it was a magical experience because it was in Cardiff Castle and there was...

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Open air.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Yeah, open air with a kind of medieval fare as well and people on the battlements and these massive carts.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And there were people on horseback, were there not?

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
People on horseback, massive huge wooden carts where the stage would roll in on carts.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Wow.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
It was amazing.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
It was really magical as a kid to be there.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
But yeah, I think my mum had such fun in Cardiff that we moved to Cardiff after that.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Of course, I remember the first time I met you, you would have been part of Theatre Taniest in Wales.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And I only joined them for the second part of a trilogy of Indo-Celtic plays.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Would you have been in the first one, which I missed?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Tristan and Asselt.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I was, yeah.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000
So you did Tristan and Asselt.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
And my mum as well in the first one.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Excellent.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And the...

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Run by Nigel Watson and Stuart Cox.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Stuart Cox was living in our house at the time of the first one.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
He was our lodger.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Right.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
He's now living in Mexico, you'd be glad to know.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:59.000
He's now living in Mexico and I'm actually the treasurer for Celebrating Cultures, which he was directing.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Excellent.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Like that.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
But yeah, yeah, that was fun.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.000
It was multi... not so much bilingual, was it?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
But multilingual was kind of...

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Yes, how is your do when you're pushed to...

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Oh, well, yeah.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
We can manage in the master, is it?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
I think that's probably...

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Something like...

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Right, right, right.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:29.000
But there was Welsh folk dancing and Indian folk dancing and drumming and sitars and all kinds of stuff going on.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And of course, for the second play, we brought over a group from India, the Bavayas from Gujarat, a troupe of 30 folk theatre performers, half of whom were brought up as female impersonators to play the female roles,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
because in Gujarati society and that tradition, women weren't allowed to perform.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Do you remember them at all?

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Extraordinary characters.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
I was.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
My personal...

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Do you remember the fairly old... he was passed on now.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Clown Ratibai, he was my favourite.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Shaved head.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
And he had this... he was just a lovely, lovely old man.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And taking them on tours, you know, got very fond memories of them.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Lovely bunches.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Extraordinary.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Anyways, my time with Tali Essin helped spawn Swicker because during that, yes, we'd have the 10 weeks of rehearsals and performances at the Gujarati Samar Centre in Grangetown, but then we tried to actually expand that and we would, you know, the community orchestra would set up for the play.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
We'd then try and see if we could keep that going, you know, through the year, etc.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:45.000
And I think it was through that that certainly I first helped introduce percussion.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
You know, we started with African drumming.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:16:03.000
And then once Tali Essin had gone to Glasgow for European City of Culture, we had set up Swicker, we introduced Samba drumming, which as a virus has managed to take over, you know, you can find it throughout the length and breadth of Wales, which is smashing, which has got to be a good thing.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Well, Anna, thank you very much indeed for all your carnival memories.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:27.000
I shall think of you on stilts, I shall think of you drumming in body paint, and I shall think of you both as a pregnant parader and a mum, marshmallow of kids, as the carnival, what can I say, madness increases.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
So many thanks indeed.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
I have to say, though it's not bankable, but it's a very worthy word.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Can I just say, Anna Shaw, you are a Cardiff Carnival hero.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Thank you very much.
