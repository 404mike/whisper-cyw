00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Track 6. I know it looks odd in the middle of the mountain.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.280
Looking across the lake you will see a distinctively green piece of land, unlike that of its heather-clad

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.840
neighbours, which provides us with a window into the past.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.400
People forget how much of a desperate situation that we were in as a nation.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.320
Immediately after the Second World War we were in rationing for many years after the

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:34.160
And so obviously the government had subsidies that promoted the use of every scrap of land

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.120
they could possibly get their hands on for the production of food.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.000
With incentives for much greater food production, sheep numbers increased here, as it did across

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.340
much of the Welsh hills. And as a young lad, local farmer Arred Davies was responsible

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.120
for creating a more productive piece of land to help feed the growing flock.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.040
Yes, well we rotivated it for Mr Jones. He decided that he was taking the sheep up to

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.320
the mountains in the summer and there wasn't enough food there. So he decided that we'll

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.680
do about 25, 30 acres. So he hired a tractor and we rotivated it. And he put about four

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.120
tonnes of lime down per acre. And that's why you see the piece on the top there today

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.920
still hasn't grown back because nothing will grow back like the vegetation on the top there

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.440
so you've got lime. So you've got to kill the lime in the ground before it comes back.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.320
So that is still today as it was there. I was the one that did that. I know it looks

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.240
odd in the middle of the mountain but it was a very good piece for Griffey. He was very

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.760
happy with it, isn't it?

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.160
When the Wildlife Trust bought Glasslin, they hoped to restore the heather on this patch.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.680
Because of the liming and fertiliser this proved almost impossible. The field has now

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.800
been grazed and managed in such a way as to gradually restore some biodiversity. But

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:03.800
it will probably never revert to full heather cover. Some land use changes can be irreversible.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.880
Follow the path to the viewpoint and listen to track seven where the path terminates at

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.760
the spectacular edge overlooking a deep ravine on your right. When you've listened to track

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.760
seven you need to retrace your steps to the lakeside and turn right.
