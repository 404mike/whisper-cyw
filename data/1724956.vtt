00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And since you've been in Wales, do you feel that you've made friends here?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
No. Not at all. I'm finding it really difficult.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I'm finding it difficult because

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
there's not a lot of people that are exactly like me

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
it's hard to pick and choose who you want to be friends with.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And I'm one of those people who I can just see a person and I'll know there and then

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
if I'm going to get on with that person or not.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And you feel that since you've been here you've not met?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I haven't met anyone like myself. If I could have another double of me

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I'd be the happiest person on the planet.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I wish I could just be able to pick the phone up and speak to someone and say

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
do you want to meet up for coffee, for lunch?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Just to do something with?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Just to do something?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But I am finding it really, really difficult because

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I find being here everyone's got their own lives

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and back in South Africa

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
you can just pick up the phone in the morning and say do you want to come spend a day together?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And they're there.
