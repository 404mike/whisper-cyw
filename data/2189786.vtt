00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920
I'm Vicki MacDonald and I'm at Holy Trinity Church, Fandenow, during the Longest Yarn.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.840
I'm talking to Dennis Pointon and he's going to tell me about his uncle Harold.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.400
So I shall pass over to him.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.900
So what can you remember?

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.400
Did he have special memories, your uncle?

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.040
Can you name him first?

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.040
I haven't said his surname.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.040
Oh, Leslie.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.200
Okay.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.120
I only met him a couple of times.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:39.240
He was very distant to the family when he came from the war.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.160
Things changed a lot for him.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:56.640
He married Auntie well before the war and he had three children.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:05.000
And apparently he had a love child later on after the war.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
He didn't know anything about it until he died.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.040
And did he know just before he died?

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.040
No, after he died.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.040
So he didn't know?

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.040
He did, but his children didn't.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.040
He didn't know he had another daughter.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.040
Oh, right.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.040
But that wasn't during the war.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.040
Where was he during the war then?

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.040
I'm not sure.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.040
He was with Monty.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:48.080
And how he got to the GC, I was told often that he was a pillar box

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.080
holding a lot of people down, firing at them.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.080
And he managed to get round and under the pillar box

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.080
and took his knees in and killed them all off.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.120
Oh, right.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.120
So he is Harold Erdly, BC.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.120
Yes, for Congleton Cheshire.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.120
Oh, wow.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.120
That is just amazing.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.120
And he came home from the war and had another love child.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.120
Did he share his memories about his VC or was he quite quiet about it?

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.120
He was very quiet about it.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:36.160
I didn't know his VC meant for quite so many years after the war.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.160
I was born just after the war as well.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.160
So I was talking to sons a lot

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.160
and they corresponded with their dad

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.200
because he decided not to live with them anymore.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.200
He got divorced but never married again.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.200
He didn't live with the mother of his love child?

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.200
I don't know one, that one.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.200
I'm not sure one.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.200
Let's not ask difficult questions.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.200
Sorry about that.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.200
In Congleton, is there a statue of him?

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.240
There is a statue of him with a rifle

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.240
and a more...

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.240
my demoral stand in Congleton, centre of Congleton.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.240
That's well worth visiting.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.240
Yes.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.240
Gosh.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.240
So has it been written anywhere else about his bravery?

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.240
I'm not sure.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.280
I don't know.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.280
I'm not sure if he was with...

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.280
I don't think it is some sort of thing

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.280
other than the one in Congleton.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.280
Oh, right, OK.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.320
Gosh.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.320
So he must have been phenomenally brave

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.320
and he came home, got divorced

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.320
and then what did he do?

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.320
Did he take up some other employment after the war?

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.320
No, I don't think he did.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.320
I'm sure he didn't.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.320
When he came back a bit,

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.320
when he came to Congleton after the war

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.360
he was a big parade in the town

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.360
and he was on top of standing up on a jeep

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.360
and everybody was waving and buntings out

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.360
and everything, welcoming back.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.360
And it seems so.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.360
He died a death with who he was.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.400
Nobody.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.400
You talk to him about it.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.400
No idea.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.400
If you mention Harold Durdby, VC man,

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.400
they wouldn't have a clue.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.400
No, things have got lost, I think, haven't they?

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.400
Yeah.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.400
I was going to ask you something about his son.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.400
So can I ask you whether you know where the VC itself is,

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.400
where the medal is?

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.440
Yes, it was with his son Roy

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.440
in Crestarton.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.440
Unfortunately, he's died now

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.440
and I don't know where these VC medals come.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.440
Whether his wife still got it, I don't know.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.440
Well, let's hope it's being looked after.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.440
Thank you so much for sharing that memory

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.440
about Harold Eardley, VC.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.480
It's good to know that we're remembering him today.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.480
And dochwa yanachy.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.480
Thank you very much indeed.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.480
Thank you both.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.480
Thank you.
