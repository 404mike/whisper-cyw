00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I be over the bridge that holdeth,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Living through this barren land.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I am being, but thou art mighty,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Holding with thy powerful hand.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Strong deliver, strong deliver,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Give us still thy strength and shield.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And with eyes full of yonder,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We will live while I pray.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
My eyes on a path of glory,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Hell and foray on the way.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
O, my God, O, my God,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:24.000
All the world is in your hands.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I am being, but thou art mighty,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Holding with thy powerful hand.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I am being, but thou art mighty,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Holding with thy powerful hand.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
O, my God, O, my God,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:02.000
All the world is in your hands.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And with eyes full of yonder,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000
We will live while I pray.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
My eyes on a path of glory,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Hell and foray on the way.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
O, my God, O, my God,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
All the world is in your hands.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I am being, but thou art mighty,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Holding with thy powerful hand.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
O, my God, O, my God,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
All the world is in your hands.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Swear ye to the Swear ye that

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Let me save all day and sign.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Songs of praises, songs of praises,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I will ever give to thee.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I will ever give to thee.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Songs of praises, songs of praises,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I will ever give to thee.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I will ever give to thee.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Songs of praises, songs of praises,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
I will ever give to thee.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I will ever give to thee.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Songs of praises, songs of praises,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I will ever give to thee.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I will ever give to thee.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I will ever give to thee.
