00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Boy, we're hot now.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Prinada bone the Gideon a bone the I guess I

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000

echan al gan cor cumberig Seattle

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now in my fractured Welsh, that means

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
a big welcome to all of you attending the third

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Gaman Bagani sponsored by the Seattle Welsh Choir.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
A few years ago, I won't tell you how many years ago it was

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I had an English professor

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and he always admonished in the speech classes

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
he said don't ever ever start out your talk or your speech

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
based on an apology.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So to show you what a good student I was

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm going to apologize

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
by saying yesterday morning I woke up

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and I couldn't even speak and the only one of course

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
who was happy about that was probably my wife

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
laryngitis

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
so when I sing with the choir this afternoon

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I think I'm going to be the only one who can sing

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
two different parts at the same time.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The hard working committee who planned and scheduled

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
today's outstanding program have insisted that I keep

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
my remarks as brief and succinct as possible.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So after careful rewriting and editing

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I have cut it down to a bare minimum of

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
what did you time me at Michael?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
27 minutes.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Okay.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We're fortunate again for the third year

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
to have as our organist Kathy Youngers.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Kathy had been the organist at this church for several years

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
until her recent defection to another church

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
to which I will not give the satisfaction of naming.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
However our Welsh heritage rubbed off on Kathy

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
enough so that when we asked her to play today

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
she didn't hesitate at all and said yes

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and not only that but selected the lovely Welsh hymn tunes

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that you've just heard in the prelude.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I know you won't believe this but there's one hymn tune there

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
that I didn't recognize

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and it's Llan Sanon and I'm going to ask Kathy

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
just to play a couple lines of it

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and when she does I want those of you who recognize it

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I want you to raise your hand.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Kathy please.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
How many of you recognize it?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
There's one.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
There are some.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Well bless your hearts.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Okay I think Tim wherever he is

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
the Welsh choir's got some research to do.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
That's a lovely thing.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I think it's great.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Before I introduce our chairman for today

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
today's program of song and music

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I would like to have your cooperation

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and just some of the logistics of today's activities.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
As is the custom of long standing

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
at any Kamanwagani it's followed by a tabach.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So for your safety and comfort

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
the ushers are going to direct you to the fellowship hall

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
down below immediately after the program as follows.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
First the balcony and if you folks were the late comers

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
boy you got a break you get to go down first.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Secondly the chapel and then the sanctuary

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
starting with the last rows

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and we'll just exit in a nice orderly fashion

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and I assure you there will be plenty of good things left

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
for the last ones to go down.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
In fact about it you may have to kind of clean it up you know.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
While you're waiting to be escorted down

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I think I'd give you an excellent opportunity

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
to check with your neighbors

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
say hello to them, introduce yourself

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and ask where did you come from?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And that kind of reminds me of a young lad

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
about 10 or 11 years old who lived in Portmattock

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
that's up in northern part of Wales

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and one evening after dinner he asked his dad

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
he says Todd where did I come from?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Well his father had somewhat expected

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
that such a question was inevitable

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
so without too much hesitation he answered

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Matthew you're a product of the love

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
your mother and I have for each other.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Every child in this world is the physical embodiment

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
of the love between his parents.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Your mother carried you until it was time for you

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
to make your appearance into this world

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and we have loved and cared for you ever since.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So after a few moments of serious thought

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Matthew exclaimed to his father

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Coo Todd I think that's astounding.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I've got to get over to Willie Jones' place straight away.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Well why do you want to do that Matthew

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
it's getting kind of late.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Well Tad I've got to tell Willie where I came from.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
His dad says he came from Aberystwyth.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
It's my pleasure now to introduce

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
the chairman of today's program Mr. Philip Humphreys

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and because of the great importance of this event

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Phil rushed to Seattle after basking

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
in the climes of Algeria this past week

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and Phil in turn will introduce the participants

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
in our program following the invocation.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
So for the invocation would you all please rise

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and I will present to you the Reverend Dr. Robert D. Nicholson

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
the pastor of the Lake City Presbyterian Church.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Jochen Bauer.
