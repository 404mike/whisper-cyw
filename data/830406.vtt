Do you remember the filmy of Arabesque?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Oh God, yeah.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.600
Peter was living in Newbridge and his mum was alive and she'd come up here and she'd

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.600
be eating Nutella.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.600
Where's her mum gone?

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.600
Three days she was out here.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.600
Oh, she's up in Crumlin watching.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.600
All the time, she'd drive up to Crumlin.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.600
Well, I was happy enough because I was leaning on a car and talking to my friend up the other

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.600
side.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.600
No, have you been that close to Sophie in the way?

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.600
I was just leaning on this car when we came in and then she got out.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.600
Did she say get off my car?

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.600
No, she said get off my car.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.200
It must have been very exciting though, was everybody very excited?

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.200
It was actually, yeah.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:39.200
Well, yeah, because we all went to see the film, didn't we?
