00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
You're Fred Wilson or Freddy?

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.320
Freddy they call me.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.520
Where were you born?

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.520
Islington.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.080
And when did you come down to South Wales?

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.120
I don't know the actual date, but I was four and nine months old.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.880
So you can work it out from that roughly.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.480
When was your birthday then?

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.160
24th of December 1935.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.800
1935, so would it be about 1940?

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.880
Yeah, I was four and nine months old.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.320
What were your feelings when you arrived in...

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.040
Well at that age, panic.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.920
And I came down in a train.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.680
We all had to go to Paddington.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.080
Your parents came with you, and then the tears were then and everything like that.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.840
And my first cousin was being evacuated at the same time.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.880
So my mother said, if you're going to be to anybody's house or anything like that,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.320
you have to stay together, two of you.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.200
Well then we went to the Glyke school and all the kids were in there.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.840
And then the people, the local people, were asked to take some children in.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.360
It was like a cattle market.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.480
And my cousin, she kept hold of me.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.960
And I was evacuated to H.R. Jones.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.400
Yeah, my cousin's brother.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.040
They lived on the Glyke then, or he lived on the Glyke,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.360
with his father-in-law, who was a miner.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.600
So that was a bit strange as well, seeing him coming on black.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.960
And in the end, he said, right, fair enough, we'll take two.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.240
So my cousin and I, we both stayed with H.R. Jones.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.720
We were separated out.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.280
We didn't know one another anyway.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.360
But when we were settled in with our people, we had to go to school then.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.280
Well, there was only one classroom.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.600
And we had one teacher, Miss Wakeman.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.240
Funny, her name's come back now.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.880
Yeah, Miss Wakeman.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.560
And she taught the three rows of pupils.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.720
You had the infants, you had the juniors, and you had the seniors.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.360
When we all, everybody, learned about the war,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.600
well, all the school teachers had to take all the children home to their mothers

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.240
to tell them what was happening.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.440
And they were all told, see, that they were going to be taken down to the station

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.760
in so-and-so time and day, and they would be safe.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.760
They're going down into Wales, near Swansea.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.640
So I can always remember my father and mother talking about it,

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.760
what we're going to do about them.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:13.920
So I had one brother, yeah, Blaise, and two sisters who were in school.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.960
And they wanted to go because to them, it was like a picnic going in a train.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.720
I think they didn't know what it was going to be like.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.560
Well, anyway, it was up to them to decide.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.840
So my parents decided to let them go.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.760
So they came down here.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.200
And of course, they were parted, weren't they?

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:43.240
My brother had a marvellous life because he was with the, you know, the new inn?

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.240
Penbank Farm.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.880
Penbank Farm, that's right.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.840
My brother was, he was very clever with his hands on that.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.000
He goes up there to them and because the farmer was good,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.800
he was riding horses in no time.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:08.120
He used to go across the bank, across all the mountains from the new inn

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.160
and end up in Pontedoui on a horse.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.120
But my two sisters were sent to Rideau-Ferot.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.120
And she used to make my sister get up early, a couple of hours early,

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.480
to get ready to go to school, to scrub the kitchen, clean the windows or anything.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.560
She made like a sleigh.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:39.160
But my youngest sister now, Marge, she went up to Rideau-Ferot

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.560
and she was with a married couple of girls.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.360
And there was a daughter there who was older than my sister was,

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.640
but they treated her like a daughter.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.840
She had a wonderful time up there.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:59.040
In fact, when she went back, she was always phoning them and they was phoning her, you know.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.720
Do you remember any of the evacuees coming to you?

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.320
Yeah, well, we had an evacuee over with us.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.880
Oh, right.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.680
Ernie Thompson from Finsbury in London.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.720
And he didn't stay after the war?

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.120
No, he didn't stay.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:22.520
He came early in the war and London wasn't bombed for long.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.160
The mother came down and took him home.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.440
He had a sister as well, which was with somebody else in the grave.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.560
And the day the mother came down and took him back,

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.240
I mean, he didn't hear anything from them since.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.400
But there is an evacuee, and she stayed in the grave?

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.800
Well, Freddie Wilson, he was with the HR Jones.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.360
He stayed with them.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.800
And he didn't go back.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.600
He was always still with them.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.440
He's a grave boy now, isn't he?

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.480
Yeah, he talks well.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.920
Oh, good.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:04.120
So the evacuees, when they came to the school, they had to learn Welsh?

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.680
Well, we could speak English with them, like, you know, so it wasn't a problem, really.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.120
You could talk to them because they had a bit of a problem with me.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.440
Or do they have their own teachers?

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.080
They brought their own teachers, yes.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.880
Well, during that time, most of them were 11-year-olds, like, you see.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.320
And they went down to Clifdon School.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.320
Oh, right, yes.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.120
But they stayed in the grave, like, you know, the bus going from the grave down to school.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.120
Every day.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.960
Now, tell me, but you had evacuees come to the leg.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.520
Well, they came up by bus from the railway station, I street, I believe.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.920
And then it was dark.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.880
It was late in the evening, you know.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:51.360
And we were all waiting outside now when all the evacuees were inside now.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.240
And we were jumping up the window to see what was happening.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.640
We could look straight inside, you know, we were jumping up.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.440
I could see the women going in, like, picking the evacuees.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.760
I knew all the mothers from the village, you know.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.760
And they were picking our boys and girls to take home, you know.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.640
So they had teachers with them.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.800
They brought their own teachers down.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.160
Well, well, they mixed in with the Welsh boy.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.560
They went, you know, they came to the Romer village school,

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.640
then they mixed with us and we played with us.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.760
And that's how we learned the Welsh from the yard, I think.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.760
Yeah.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.360
Were they big boys?

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.240
Well, yes, they were bigger than us, you know.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.560
And the average size were bigger than us.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.360
From Chatton, they were, East End, you know.
