00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.800
Right then. The interviewer is Catherine McShane and this is an interview for the Cardiff Carnival

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:23.400
25th Anniversary Heritage Project. I'm here with Jude Thilburn Price and it's the 15th

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.000
of October 2014. Could you spell your name just for the recording? All of it? Yes please.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:43.080
Jude, J-U-D-E, Thilburn, T-H-O-B-U-R-N hyphen Price, P-R-I-C-E. Great, thank you. And we're

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:50.360
in Trowbridge in Cardiff. That's right. And so, I'd just like to ask you, how did you

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.680
get involved in Cardiff Carnival? I used to get involved a long time ago when it used to be the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:05.160
Lord Murs Parade. They used to be going on in Cardiff. I used to go with my nan to the church

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.240
halls and they'd be working for ages. It seemed making different things. The lorries would turn

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:21.880
up on Friday and everyone would start decorating the lorries for the float. So, my involvement

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.320
with the parade through Cardiff has been a lifelong thing. I didn't do anything for a long time

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:39.800
and I dragged Ray down one year to see Dragon down by the Millennium Centre and he was at a

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:47.000
night show which he was quite taken with. I said to him, do you fancy having a go next year

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.760
for Carnival? And he said, we'd give it a go. So, we'd come down for the launch night

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:05.960
and from there then we got involved with it. And that's how we came to do it. It was something

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.400
I'd always wanted to do but I'd never quite got round to getting to Carnival Camp because I'd

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.040
always been working. But when I retired, got retired from work, then obviously I had time to come and

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:28.120
have a dabble. So, we brought our large puppet making skills with us. So, you started with making

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:38.760
large puppets? Well, I'd always made puppets and big structures and costumes and animation and done

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.320
film and performance. So, we brought with us the skills, if you like, for making big puppets and

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:55.640
that was the year that we had Queen Elizabeth to do and a lot of the other big wings, big structures

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:03.560
as well. So, that was quite an interesting experience. Interesting in what way? Well, we

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.200
went for the one week's, we signed up to do the one week's training but unfortunately the people

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.960
that were teaching it could only stay for the week. And we had a bit of a list of to-dos then

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.240
for the following two weeks to make sure that everything was made and constructed

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.120
for dressing so that it could go out for Carnival. So, we spent another two weeks

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.920
full-time really down there to make everything we needed to go for the day. Otherwise people

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:46.600
wouldn't have had stuff to wear and to do anything with. So, what were they made out of? Mostly

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:55.320
aluminium, fibre pole, what else? All different fabrics were put on them.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.800
Some latexing was done for unscrimming for hands and large faces.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.640
I did quite enjoy making all the big hands. They were quite nice to see them all sort of

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:19.480
stood on the desk. These like five times hands drying out everywhere. They were quite good and

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.680
spraying them out on the sticks was a laugh. Rigging it all up was quite good though. I did

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:32.360
enjoy rigging them all up and seeing everything moving on the day was a nice thing to see.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.240
So, how many have you done since then? Let's see,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:47.800
four. I think we've done four since then. So, different things each year.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.720
Have you got a favourite?

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.840
I quite like this year's when we were all different puppets, when we weren't big structures

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.840
to wear through. I was mostly down to my health that I wasn't like 10 to 15 foot tall

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:13.640
to manoeuvre things about. But we had nice big heads this year and the baby came and she was a

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:20.280
sausage so we did a punch and duty set loosely based on the muppets. But the kids enjoyed it so

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.040
that's all that mattered. Only the thing was it was raining all the way round and the costumes

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:34.520
were getting heavier and heavier as they absorbed the water. It's part of the thing. The other

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:42.120
ones we've been rained on quite a few times. But I don't know, it's one of those things. You've

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:49.800
worked so hard for the time leading up to it. It's the finale, isn't it? If it rains, it rains

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:57.560
you get wet. So, it'd be a shame not to take it all out after you've spent months working on something.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.560
So, you spend months on it rather than the three weeks?

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.440
Yeah, I've spent like a long time making what we make to go out.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.960
So, yeah, we'll start planning what to make for next year now.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.200
Any ideas?

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:24.440
Well, I do quite like Day of the Dead and I do quite like the big cat arenas. The skeleton's a

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.440
little dressed with the big hats. I've had a couple of people say they're interested in

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:39.080
being a section with those so that's one possibility. I can't think, I did think of

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.480
something else. I can't think of what it was now but it'll probably change a couple of times by then

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:53.400
anyway. So, is it the making part of Carnival that you're most interested in or is it the

00:06:53.400 --> 00:07:00.040
performing? I enjoy the making although I don't say I relish it while I'm sat up at two and three

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.760
o'clock in the morning sewing or sticking and gluing and you can't get through the house because

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:11.480
it's full of bits of puppet and structure and stuff like that. So, that can be a bit of a nightmare.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.880
I do enjoy taking them out and performing them because it's the only way to see how things work

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:25.480
and make notes for future builds and stuff like that. So, it's always good to perform something

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:34.920
you've made as a prop maker because you get to see how it functions then because a lot of the time

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:40.600
it's very rare you'll make the same thing twice. I don't think I've ever made the same thing twice

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:48.600
in all my life. So, it's always like you might use different ways of then constructing the inside

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.800
for next year but the actual outside of whatever it's going to be might be completely different

00:07:54.520 --> 00:08:03.240
but you sort of change how you rig something up maybe by being able to wear it. So, it gives

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:09.480
you a lot of insight from the performer's point of view that you then use like when we're commissioned

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:14.040
to do work for other people. So, it's always good to try your stuff.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.720
And obviously you've performed in the rain. Yeah, quite a few number of times.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:32.200
And you mentioned the little ones. Yeah, well they like, my grandchildren like doing it.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:40.280
Um, Reese came about three years ago. He wanted to be an electric eel. I don't know why,

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:46.440
just one of those things the little boys wanted to be. Ellie was a mermaid. That year we made the

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:52.040
smallest car in the floating the world which was basically a cut down supermarket trolley,

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:58.520
no names mentioned, and a car seat so because she can't walk very fast so we made a little

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:05.240
trolley that we towed on the back of our disability scooter with the giant mermaid on.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:12.200
So, that was their first carnival and even though it did rain a bit on them they did like it so they

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:21.240
they wanted to do it since. So, I can't remember what they were last year but this year they were

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:26.040
Ellie wanted to be the dog from the Muppet so we made a wolf head and

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:33.880
bodysuit and Reese was Kermit the Frog done as the crocodile from the Punch and Judy.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:41.640
We went as Waldorf and Statler Punch and Judy and little Abby she's only four she wanted to be a

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:47.640
sausage so we made her. Yeah, you know, but it gives you a chance so you can be anything you like

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:55.240
really, as long as you've got glitter on it. It's a goer. But yeah, we're looking at wheels and stuff

00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:02.120
for next year just in case we want to go large again but depends on my health like

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:09.000
so whether we can actually manage to perform large structures now I might have to scale them down to

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.680
like eight foot. That's still big. Yes, it's not as big as like you know the others but yeah maybe

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:22.200
scale things down to our eight foot for next year and see what we come up with.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:30.360
But yeah, see what the kids want to be and work from there and work from there up. Yeah, you

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:36.520
normally get like two potato drawings with some arms and legs in unusual places with their

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:41.320
description of what they want to be and then you have to like you know work from that.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:47.160
Oh, is it a challenge? Yeah, it is a bit but it's always worth seeing their faces when you've made

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.720
their costumes and all their stuff and they've been trying them on as you've been making them

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.840
they've been in and out the conservatories was sewing and sticking and gluing and what have you

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:03.480
and the little it's like Christmas morning you know when their costumes made and they've got it on

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:09.000
so they do like they do like doing it and sometimes if they've seen their friends as

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.400
they're going around they give them a little wave although this year they was too busy getting

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:22.200
drowned. I think this year was the worst weather we've experienced. The other the other years it's

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:29.160
rained before we've gone out and it's been all right you know as we've done going around but

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:39.480
god it was wet this year. Yeah carnival in Wales. And as we had a bit of foam and sponge and stuff

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:45.960
used in our costumes we were just soaking the water up all the way round. It took three weeks

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:53.160
to dry off with the dehumidifier in the conservatory. The heads and I can put them away now.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:12:00.440
It took three weeks to dry the foam out. There we go memories.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:07.240
Were there any other memorable moments from your carnivals over the last few years?

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.760
When we were when we were making Queen Elizabeth to go out the other year

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:20.040
a couple years ago Ray had to be Queen Elizabeth because it was quite a heavy structure to

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:28.920
um to wear and for the time of going out like you got the time of the lineup so that's about

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:34.360
an hour you stood in it then you got your like walk around plus the little stops used to be so

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.200
you used to have to be work out that you were in for about two and a half to three hours.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:45.160
It was such a heavy structure Ray had to do that one but when we went out the back of the channel

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:51.000
view to have a look at it and test it for blowing over and stuff like that see how stable it was.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.600
We noticed Caroline, Sian and I that his trainers didn't match his dress so we had to go looking

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:05.960
for a pair of beige trainers then that would match his frock for carnival day because they

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:11.800
just clashed with the ones he had so he had a new pair of trainers out of that and he'd done quite

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:17.240
well this year he had a new pair to go with his Punch and Duty striped trousers and a new pair

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:23.080
of blue trainers so obviously Ray gets a new pair of trainers every time we go out and do carnival

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:32.040
so yeah that was that was quite good um the feeling of relief when I took that

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:38.920
costume off that that huge structure yeah that was worth it I couldn't walk for days after then

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:48.120
and the bruises bruises were horrific from carrying such large packs but um it was worth it

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:53.240
you came back for more yeah it was worth it though because when you go up and you sneak behind people

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:58.520
when you got big hands and then you put your hand around them and people like to have their photos

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:04.920
taken with you so you go stand you stand in the photo so you're huge and they just like lots of

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:10.600
people uh want to come up and have a photo taken so you've got to catch up to where you were then

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:15.480
you know in the in the line on the line somewhere so you've lost your place because you've stopped

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:21.560
so many times for people to have their photos done I know Ray like scared in the crowd with

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:29.160
his big hands and stuff so yeah it's a good laugh I prefer to perform them and they do something

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:35.960
than just walk about doing nothing with them you know they got to have a little life with their own

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:45.080
wallet out is uh is best yeah something to play with yeah and it's a bit more interactive for

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:49.880
the crowd there and they seem to appreciate it you know when you give them a poke with a big arm

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:56.760
or something always makes them laugh makes a couple shriek yeah but yeah makes a lot of kids

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:04.280
cry when they see oh I don't like the big heads so yeah it's a laugh so yeah being as Reese and

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:10.040
Ellie are bigger now we might get them to wear a big puppet well would be a big puppet for them so

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:16.520
it might be about five foot but it's still in relation to their size quite uh big

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.560
because Reese's uh then backpack puppets now for a couple of years so he's uh

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:29.720
uh you can take a bigger structure this year after giving me his wheat a bit so

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:35.880
but uh yeah they enjoy you know so it's worth doing for that

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:44.200
it's nice to go down carnival camp as well and see your everyone down there um and chat to them

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:49.880
and see what they're making we help a lot of people make their structures help them with um

00:15:50.280 --> 00:16:00.280
um all the mechanics of things uh their structure um problem solving with them so that's you know

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:06.760
it's always nice to see everyone's stuff finished and out out and about and knowing like all the

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:14.520
blood sweat and tears are going into making things uh but yeah it's a nice it's a nice day out

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:24.280
um apart from the rain of course but can't can't have everything can you so yeah

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:37.160
oh thank you very much oh thank you for having us over
