00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We used to, it was a sort of brick-built prison under corrugated iron, no windows, nothing

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I thought I thought, and we used to have food, and I can remember seeing big beetles like that

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and three or four black beetles cutting it, and I was fascinated, but the number, you see this thing

00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:03.000
moving around and going like hell, and we were looking at them, and because we didn't know what they were then

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:16.000
we would only just been to Africa, we'd just come off the boat about an hour or so, and that was the African Queen

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and we came back, but we came from Saramton, and it was different, and Africans were still getting in the whole sort of

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and they were playing different things with the...

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:58.000
There's a little bit of a reserve now

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The nice people, the nice people, and they select the rhythm of the singing, and of course, they can have African songs

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I don't really know the words, but oh, it's wonderful

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Oh, it's wonderful, and I could listen to it all night, and I would go 20 or more hours

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:35.000
We enjoyed that

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Must have been very powerful, everybody singing the National Anthem together

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Well, we used to go with friends, and we enjoyed ourselves

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So was it just the men, or did the women come as well?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Some women came, but my wife didn't come, no, she wasn't a rugby fan

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Hello, Brad

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I speak a little Welsh

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I speak more... mine is not a classical Welsh, but it's basically alright

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Can you say that in Welsh?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Can you sing a bit of Welsh?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
The sun is coming

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:03.000
The sun is coming

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Blood, blood, blood, the lowly one

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
The lowly one

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
The lowly one

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
The lowly one

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
The lowly one

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
The lowly one

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Oh wow, that was fabulous

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Oh, the choir, you are singing that

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:53.000
You are nothing without your railled hair

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:05.000
When there is no dance, people dance
