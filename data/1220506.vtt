I sometimes feel sad about my parents. I should perhaps tell you that my mother had the misfortune

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:17.200
of losing three daughters. We're back to threes. The eldest one was born in 1916, probably

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:27.040
died of Spanish flu in 1919. The second one died of what we now call sepsis or septicemia

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:37.360
at the age of two. And the third one, tragically, my mother accidentally smothered in bed. And

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:47.400
she was convinced that she was possessed of a dybbuk. And old Jerovich, who was very wise,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.120
who taught me my Bible, wonderful man, he did something quite remarkable because Jews

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.680
don't believe in devils. They don't believe in exorcism. But he did. He said,

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:08.080
you are possessed by a dybbuk, I will remove it. And he did. I wasn't party to this. I've

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:15.040
only been told by Saul. And that in fact there was a whole olly-wolly-bolly and it's gone,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:24.600
suddenly. And she was fine. And then she had three children who all lived reasonable lives.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.840
Three sons.
