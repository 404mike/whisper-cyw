00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.000
O diute, the one night, O doth all the earth live, O diute, O diute, give health and health.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Where the heart would, where the nerve of mania, O diute, the one night, O diute, give health and health.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:18.000
O come, O be faithful, joyful and triumphant, O come ye, O come ye to bless the world.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Come and behold him, O'er the King of Angels, O come, let us adore him, O come, let us adore him, O come, let us adore him, Christ the Lord.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation, Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Glory to God, glory in the highest, O come, let us adore him, O come, let us adore him, O come, let us adore him, Christ the Lord.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Amen.
