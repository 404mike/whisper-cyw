00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I just got to say I'm Marcia Marnie and it's Friday May the 17th 2019.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Oh wasn't you just telling about the kitty catcher?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Well, I should have said it in that phrase should I?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
No!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
But you had, what do you call them now?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That's OK.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Thanks Dennis.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
That's all right, no problem.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Truant officer.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Hi, that might have been it.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But as kids you were, you know.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And he used to go around, you know, making sure that...

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
He was on his bike?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Yeah, yeah, we were all on our bikes, you know.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And I can laugh about when I first started school I went at four

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
because my youngest brother used to take me on the crossbar

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
because it was, well, it was always space in the little local school.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So Cushing tied on the crossbar and he pedaled me down to...

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Colcliffe School?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Colcliffe School.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Oh my goodness, on the crossbar?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
On the crossbar, yeah.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And I had about six months with it before he left because he left at 15 then.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And then I used to pedal the bike down.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And of course, living so far up the lane, our local policeman always had...

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Well, he was on his bike and he used to wait on the other end of the lane for me

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and we'd pedal to school.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
He would pedal to school with you?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Yeah, because perhaps I was a little chopsy girl, I don't know,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
but he'd know all the news because I'd be telling him all that was happening,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
you know, around.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Oh my goodness.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And that was every morning.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And he used to come up here and have a cup of tea with my mam and all that, you know.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
He said, I know what's going on, I know what's going on.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
He said all around, he said, because every morning I'd wait for a cat on the end of the road,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
sit there on my bike.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
How lovely. What was his name?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Mr. Harrison.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Did he live on the...

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
He lived at the police station down there.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
We had a police station...

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Where was the police station?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
On your way down, you'd have gone to Margaret's.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
There was a row of houses.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The police station was opposite.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Not far from Mr. Corks.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Oh really?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
The police station was there on the left-hand side.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Oh really?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Mr. and Mrs. Harrison.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Did he wear a proper uniform?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Oh yeah.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And one of those hats?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Yeah.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And we'd pedal.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I'd be pedalling down, he'd be there waiting for me, and off to school.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Of course he'd say, I was so and so.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Of course.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I'd know, because this was like a whole house.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
They'd come down to my dad, or one or the other, you know.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So I'd know all the news as a kid.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And you always had to listen and be quiet.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
You never had to...

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
How can I put it?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
If dad had somebody in, or mum only off the top row,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
you were allowed to sit in the room.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
But you didn't have to, you could go on playing, but you didn't have to open your mouth.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
But you were listening.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Oh yeah.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So of course I used to relay it.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Oh that's such a lovely image.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Him, his bike, you on your little bike.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Yeah, pedalling down the lane.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Look at him, he'd be sat on the bottom there by Grove Farm.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Right, off we'd go then.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I'd still see his son now.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Well, he's...

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Yeah, there was always people in the range.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Yeah, really.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Yeah, you'd always see a car in or something in the range, you know.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
But you peddled your bike, and what I thought about...

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Well, my childhood anyway.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
My daughter, I was a bit like it when I had...

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
My two were a boy and a girl, right?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I'd read to them and all, you know.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
But when I was small, there was nothing.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
We had no electric, we had nothing.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So you had...

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
No electric here?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
No, not until the coronation of Queen Elizabeth.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
This one now, wasn't it?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Was I 11?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Would I have been 11 then?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
You were 78 now?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Yeah.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Why?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
53 you got electricity here.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So what did you have before?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
A tilly lamp and a table lamp on the table with the...

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
What you call it, mantle, wasn't it?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Yeah.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Yeah, you had the ordinary lamp with the mantle.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And then, I've still got it in the other room.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Mam had a lamp which...

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
There was a wick that you turned up.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Like a sickle.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And that's all we had.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
We had...

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
We didn't have...

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I remember Main's Water coming to a year.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I would have been about seven.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
What did you have before?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Out of the well.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
There's a well in the garden?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
You walk by it.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Well, by there you'll see the pump.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
It still works.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
No.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Really?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Yeah.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
You've got to prime it now.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
That's amazing.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Just put the thing off.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
I'll show it to you when you go out.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Put the thing off the top.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Pour a little drop of water in.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I suppose...

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
No, hang on.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
That's the swell...

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
You don't pump water now.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Yeah.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So was that one of your jobs?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
No.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
I don't think it was trusted.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
The boys done that.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
My job was when I was small,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
because they hand washed.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Mother had a lady come in every Monday.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Only on a Monday.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I wash every day now, but only on a Monday.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And...

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Auntie Annis, she lived on the top road there.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And she'd be a washing.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
But when I was home from school,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
right, holiday time,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
my job was to turn the mango.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Oh.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Turn the mango.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Yeah.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Yeah, it was common.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Well, yeah, turn it.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
That was my job.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
So Mam and her was on the dolly board and what have you.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And after they'd rinsed the water,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
there was...

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
They used to light a fire, look, to boil the washing.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
The big old boilers.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
They hadn't long been took out.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
What, in the...

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
In the office.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Yeah, outside now.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Oh, my goodness.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
There was two boilers,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and the washing would be put in,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and they'd put the lid on, sort of thing.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Then they'd be pulling them out with like...

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Was it a dolly?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
I don't know.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
It had like a round handle,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and they used to pull the washing out into a bath.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Yeah, but not those wooden tongs things.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Yes.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Yeah.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Thank you.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
When I tell my kids sometimes,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
my grandchildren, they says,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Nan, I didn't realise you lived in the Ark ages.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And I was lucky being the youngest.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
We bathed in front of the fire at night in the kitchen,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
look, open fire.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
What, in the tomb?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
In the long bath.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Did you really?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Yeah.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And I was always first in.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Now, Mam had to go and get this water,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
because she'd like that for water for us, you know.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Yeah.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Only once a week we had a bath.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And that was on a Sunday night.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Didn't we?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Yeah.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
On a Sunday night?

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Yeah.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
You had a, I was first in.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Yeah.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And then, Mamma kept topping up the water.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
My brothers, my two younger, well, next to me,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
seven and nine years older,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
they'd be next in the bath, then the oldest one,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
then Dad, then Uncle lived with us, Dad's brother.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And Mam was always last.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And they'd tell me,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I was the youngest in the family.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And Mam was always last.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And they'd tip it out, and the fire was going.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And you had a candle to go to bed.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I still got my candle stick now.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Have you really?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
The one you used as a child?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Yeah, which you put your handle in,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
it was enamel, wasn't it?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Yeah.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
So I still got that now.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And you'd go upstairs.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
I don't, you know, but you'd take your candle upstairs.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And sometimes my uncle would be up there reading me a story,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
because I was the youngest, right?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Sometimes you had a warm drink to go to bed with you.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And sometimes Mam would come along,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
and go to sleep, and she'd come upstairs,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
I'm going to sleep now.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
No, put the candle out in case it went to fire.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
She had like a little V thing that put over the...

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Oh, like a little snuffer?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Yeah.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Candle snuffer.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Yeah, put over that.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And you had a good sleep then, didn't you?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
I liked it.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
But it was happy days, because they always played with us.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Yeah.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
You either played cards, which was snap or whatever,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
you played cards, you played drives, snakes and ladders.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Did you have a radio?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Yes.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And it was about that big, a bit on the front.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
That went years ago, though.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
I think it was his master's voice, if I can remember.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
The radio was called.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
You know.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
You had to be quiet.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
They always listened to the arches.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
So don't ask me what time that was on.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Seven o'clock, normally.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Right.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Well, you had to be quiet.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And then you could listen to anything.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Now, my father used to do rabbits on the wall with the candlelight, you know.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Somehow, and you'd have shadows on the wall.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Shadow puppets.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Yeah.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
He'd do it with his hands.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
So somehow, you know, I can remember that now.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
What was his name?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
John.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
John.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Yeah.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
John Johnson?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
No, no, John Hale.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
I was a Hale.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Hale H?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
A-L-E.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
A-L-E.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Yeah.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And your mother's name?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Ruby Victoria.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
That's a nice name.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Dad was John Valentine, because he was born on the 14th of February.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Oh.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And Mam was Ruby Victoria.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
So.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
So where was your father from?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Redwick.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
He was from Redwick?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
He avenged the, yes, from Redwick, my father was from.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
He was born in Redwick Brick House, Parkes is Brick House, the big house.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Yeah.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
He was born there.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And he buried in Redwick, my mother and my two brothers, you know, over there.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Oh, really?

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Redwick.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
So I said I'm going to Redwick.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
I know I was born here.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
But, yeah.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Was your mother from Redwick?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Yes.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Oh.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Yeah.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
So.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
What brought them here then, Caz?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Right, well, we didn't own, well they didn't own it then.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.720
My gran and grandpa retired from Brick House in Redwick, and they came to live at Fair

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.720
Orchard Farm, Nash.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:12.320
Well, Dad had got married then, and he'd gone out to Lentarnham to live, the other side

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.320
of Newport.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.320
Yeah.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.320
Dad and Mam.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.320
Yeah.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:25.080
Then, Uncle, who were never married, he moved down to the farm on Pycorna, right by the

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:30.920
drainage board, the one on the straight road, not Pycorna Farm, there's one on the side,

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.120
didn't I, just go by that there.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:39.920
He moved down there, but not to live with his mum and dad, he moved there on his own.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:45.920
Well then, my gran and grandpa, who I never knew any of my grandparents, and I decided

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:55.920
they'd died before I was born, they, she wasn't very well, and Dad only had one sister, and

00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.760
she lived up us, and got married and went to us to live, and went very well.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:10.600
So, things along the line, Dad and Mam, and two children, came back, yes, Bill and I was

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:19.600
born here, came back from Lentarnham to live with Uncle, not with the mother and father,

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:27.600
to look after, or be near to his father, like you know, my grandfather, and they nursed

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:36.440
them at home, the two of them there, and then they didn't want to go to live in Fair Orchard,

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:41.440
well there was two others, and I suppose perhaps paying somebody out or something, but the

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.440
oldest brother bought it, and he moved there.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:51.440
Well then this farm came up, and Uncle and Dad sort of merged together, and they said

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.440
they'd rent this farm, and they moved here.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.280
Well then Bill was born here, and I was born here.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.280
So you've been here all your life?

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.280
Yeah, in the room up above this one.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.280
Really, you were actually born in the house?

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:11.280
In the house, and I moved down the land in a bit, and I'm looking over the back now,

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.280
you know.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.280
Oh my goodness.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.280
Yes, I was actually born here.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.280
So did your mother, was there a local midwife?

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:22.280
Yes, she lived on the top road where you would have come down, Broad Street Common, Nurse

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.280
Adams.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.280
Nurse Adams?

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.120
Yeah.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.120
Really?

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.120
Nurse Adams.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:34.120
That's where she lived, very nice lady, she was there quite a long while after.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:38.120
So do you think she was midwife to lots of babies born around here?

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.120
Yeah, yeah, she was midwife.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.120
Oh gosh.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.120
So what sort of farm was it?

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.120
Was it large dog, or?

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:57.960
It was cows and calves, and Dad used to do a bit of dealing as well, he'd go to Gloucester

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.960
Market, and buy milk and cows and sell them to the other dairy farmers.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.960
He dealt a bit.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.960
Oh really?

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.960
And Uncle didn't, no Uncle stayed home here, you know, you're sure.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.960
I think we had nothing, do you know what I mean?

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.960
Yeah.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.960
But we were happy.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:21.200
There was happy times where, how can I put it, well there was always somebody coming

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.200
in.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.200
You seem happy.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.200
Yeah.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.200
Yeah.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:29.200
You know, it was always, and now, like Dennis, he's come down now, he knows where everything

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.200
is.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:35.200
So as a child, did you have to work on the farm?

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.960
Did you have a day job?

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:44.200
I did when I was 70, well, that was the scenario, I got through to grammar school when I was

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:51.960
77, I passed my exam and I went to Chepstow, Larkfield on the hill at Chepstow, but because

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:58.360
I was this side of the pond, if we did, in our yard where you've pulled in, if I'd have

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:02.240
been the other side of the pond, I'd have only had a canterbeze lick.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:08.960
But because of this side of the pond, then I missed out on quite a few things, because

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:15.820
in those days, you used to be able to belong to the netball team after school, after activities,

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.000
you could never stay behind, because we didn't have a car at that stage.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
So how did you get to school?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.680
Oh, well, it used to be, Mr Jones used to take us to school, and he used to also haul

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.400
cars into market in a van, quite a big van.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.840
Well on a Wednesday, if he didn't have time to sweep out, he'd put the benches in, back

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.840
in for us and we got in the van.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.720
Oh, that's fantastic!

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:47.040
We had a lovely time, and then his son took over, and his son used to pick us up in the

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:53.240
mornings, I used to have to be on the, because we had to catch the bus on Crosshands in Newport

00:15:53.240 --> 00:16:02.800
now, we had to catch that bus, the quarter past eight bus at the Crosshands, so picking

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.200
up around here, I had to be on the top road by seven o'clock.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:13.880
And I didn't get home at night, until the quarter past four from there, and then he

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:19.720
used to have to pick us up and bring us and deliver us all around like at night.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:24.280
I used to come in the house year at the earliest, about quarter to six, six o'clock.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.560
It was a long day.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:30.160
It was a long day, but the Edmaster was ever so good to us, because we used to do our own

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.160
work on the bus.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:39.120
There was only nine of us, nine of us wanted on the, he picked up, from Nashwich, yeah,

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.680
I mean we do our own work on the bus, didn't we?

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:46.600
And if one had it wrong, we all had it wrong.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:52.520
But he was marvellous, Colonel Webb he was, his name was.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.520
Colonel Webb?

00:16:53.520 --> 00:17:00.760
Yeah, the Edmaster, and the first time he had us up outside of his door for copying,

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.360
well you know it was suspicious, wasn't it?

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:08.360
Well then when we explained what time we get home, when it was time to go to bed, when

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:13.360
you got home you had a bit of tea, I mean, and you couldn't do it in the morning, because

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.360
it couldn't help.

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:21.960
And he said, oh that's alright, he said, do as you want to do, he said, you know, we

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:26.360
laughed over it, but the first time he had us up for copying on work.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:31.960
I mean if you all had it right it was fine, but sometimes you know, you'd all have a little

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.960
input, no, no, that ain't right, no, that ain't right, so we just go for the...

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.960
So you, when were you at school then, there, what year would that have been?

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:46.960
Er, when I was born in 41 and I would have been 11 when I passed my 11 plus.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.960
41, 51, 52.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:54.960
I'd have been 11, I started in 11, so I'd have started in the September lock.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:01.560
September of 52, so 52, ok, yeah, ok, ah.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.560
Yeah, it was then.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:08.560
Well then, I always wanted to be a policewoman, don't ask me why, when I was at school, yeah,

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.560
I don't know why.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.560
Probably getting a right, left, school, the local bobby.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:19.560
I always wanted to be a policewoman, but it didn't materialise, because I left at 16,

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:25.560
right, did my exams, left at 16 and came home.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:32.560
Mam won very well and in those days I suppose the girl had to, yeah, and my dad had a heart

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.560
attack and he died at 58.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:41.560
So of course, mother and uncle and my two brothers, well it would be three brothers

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:46.560
until the other one got married, was here, so I came home to work then.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:51.560
I've enjoyed it, I've been on the farm ever since.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:52.560
Oh.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:57.560
I do the book work now, well I've done the book work, well I've done the vat and all

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.560
that ever since it came out.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.560
Well done you, because that's not the easy thing to do.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:07.560
Oh, I do the vat, I do have an inspection every so often, but I'm alright.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.560
What about Goldcliff School then, you went there?

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:14.560
Yeah, I went to Goldcliff and that's where we had the 11 plus, we sat there, look.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.560
Well actually in the school?

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.560
The school, in the school.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:18.560
Did you?

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.560
Yeah, yeah.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.560
So it must have been a good school because a lot of you passed.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:32.560
We had two, they were lovely too, Mrs Ayo, funny enough, no relation to us, no.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:42.560
She used to live at Land of Any, Megal, you know Land of Any, and Mrs Shepherd we had,

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:48.560
she used to come down from Pontypool, bus it into Newport and bus down, she didn't have

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.560
a car.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:56.560
Well, because Dad was Redwick, Mrs Ayo knew, well she was a Miss James first and then she

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:05.560
married Jim Ayo, I'd always sit on her lap if I was tired and I always had to have a

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:06.560
bra strap.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.560
You always had to have a bra strap?

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:14.560
No, I wouldn't go to sleep, she used to nurse me and I had to get in there to Oldis to go

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.560
to sleep with a bra strap.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.560
That's so sweet.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.560
And then if I won very well she had a car, didn't she?

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.560
So she'd bring me home.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.560
Oh.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.560
Leave my bike in school because you know, I mean, they could always get me down, I always

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:31.560
had plenty of bikes, they did, yeah, but she'd bring me home.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:36.560
She was a teacher apparently when I was born and she'd come up to see Mam the day I was

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.560
born, the day after I was born in the school down there.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.560
It was like a community more then, wasn't it?

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.560
Yeah.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.560
I mean, well.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.560
You knew everybody.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:54.560
Everybody you knew and you'd see somebody in the lane, well you knew him, he was either

00:20:54.560 --> 00:21:01.560
from around, and years ago, like, well no, it was always Caldecott and Wentz, look, the

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:07.560
men used to trim the, by hand the reens and all by hand, right?

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.560
A bit like that, that sort of thing, that sort of thing.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.560
Oh that's a scythe.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:12.560
Yeah.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:16.560
It used to be like a hook, a hook, yeah that's a scythe for the grass.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.560
Like a long stick.

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:18.560
Yeah.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:22.560
And they'd be doing the banks now where the tractors do it, they all done it by hand.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.560
Really?

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.560
Yes.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.560
Have you seen that?

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.560
Yes, I mean, we used to see him, have a talk to him.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:40.560
Alf Stevens was one of them, Ernie Stevens, Billy England, oh Cox, oh dear, John Cox,

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.560
they'd be all out trimming the reens, yeah.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.560
So they'd be teams of men?

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.560
Yeah, trimming along, yeah.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:49.560
Really?

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.560
There was no, well there wasn't tractors then.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.560
What sort of time of year would they normally do that?

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:58.560
Well it didn't really bother about the birds and all that, did it?

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.560
I shouldn't say that.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.560
Well it was a different time.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:11.560
Yeah, and they'd do it about, as the grass, oh I should think it would be April, May.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.560
And would they be doing it on their land or?

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.560
No, everybody, they'd be doing our main reen.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.560
Yeah?

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.560
They'd be doing all their main reens, all by hand.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.560
All by hand.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.560
Yeah, yeah.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.560
Big job.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.560
And they used to keep it under.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.560
Say no more!

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.560
Say no more?

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.560
No.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:31.560
Did they ever clear it out?

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.560
Clear the stuff out of the reen?

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:39.560
No, only by raking, if there was a blockage, they had like a big old, about that big I

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:43.560
think it was, yeah, and they'd just only pull it onto the bank.

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:44.560
Really?

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.560
They never ditched anything out of it.

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.560
Like a rake?

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.560
Yeah, yeah.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:52.560
If there was a blockage that could block the water going under the arches, they'd pull

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.560
it out on the side.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.560
Yeah.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.560
Oh, did you ever do that?

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.560
No.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.560
No?

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:08.560
I knew how the reens used to flow, because as a little girl, I think Mum wanted to get

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:13.560
rid of us sometimes, and if Dad was walking to the reens, going along thinking the water

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.560
reen coming as well as it should do, you know there's got to be a blockage, he'd take you

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.560
with him.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.560
I used to love it.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:26.560
And nobody would believe me when we had new ones, they went over to all these levels,

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:31.560
you know, right, so water runs down the middle, don't it?

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:36.560
So I told him, who's the one that I told and he didn't believe me where our water come

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:37.560
from?

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:41.560
Our water in the ditches from here comes from Nasharch.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.560
Does it really?

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:47.560
And it wanders its way down and it gets into that when it comes out and then goes into

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.560
Chappalee.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:55.560
He said, no, no, no, no, I'll pump your water, because it was that very dry, he said, oh,

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.560
about 30 years, we had a very dry time.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.560
76.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:59.560
Yeah.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.560
We had a very dry time.

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.560
Yeah.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:06.560
And he said, oh, we'll pump your water, because I said, you can't.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:10.560
Yes, he said, of course you can pump water.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.560
He said, you can't.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:17.560
But they pumped for two days and they shut the pump off at night because the water was

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:18.560
running down here.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.560
He was pumping up here, wasn't he?

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.560
But when they shut it, they took levels.

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:24.560
Yeah.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:28.560
And he wouldn't believe me that our water comes from Nasharch and I said, well, as a

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:33.560
little girl, we walked up those fields and we got there, you'd have a blockage.

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.560
So dad had pulled the blockage out.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.560
That is so interesting.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.560
And you're really listening to your dad.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.560
Oh, yeah.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:43.560
Well, you sort of, where?

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.560
I suppose I was sparked by my background.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.560
Perhaps being the only girl.

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.560
You sound like a bright little girl.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.560
Being the only girl, I think.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.560
I think the boys were mums.

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.560
No mum was good to me.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.560
But I think I was dad's girl.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:03.560
Dad died at 58, so of course I was only 17.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:08.560
But he knew very well how his reams ran.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.560
He knew that.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.560
We'd walk by and say, it was lovely.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.560
And I tell you another thing he used to take me, and I loved it.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.560
Birds nesting.

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.560
Never to take any eggs out of the nest.

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:27.560
You just walked and he'd say, listen, and you'd like tweet it.

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:32.560
And you'd look, oh, there would be sometimes just one on there, but then you'd see little

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.560
babies in the nest.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.560
We'd done all that with him.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.560
With your dad?

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.560
Would you know what the birds were?

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.560
Yeah.

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.560
And I tell you another thing he used to take me with him.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.560
Roses.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.560
He used to love grafting roses.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:52.560
Now you walk around the hedges and find the best dogbriar.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.560
You know, that'd be a thick one.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:26:00.560
And he'd tie a little bit of raffia, whitey stuff around it.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.560
Well, then he'd go and dig it up.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.560
Later on in the autumn, I think, he'd dug it up.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.560
Yeah, it was the autumn.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.560
Then you grafted, didn't you, in the autumn?

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.560
Yeah.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.560
He'd take off his rose's ear and he'd graft it.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.560
And he'd put like muck around it, like clay.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.560
Then he'd wrap this raffia around it.

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.560
Oh, it ain't cool.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.560
But that's how he had these standard roses.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.560
Good dogbriar.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:31.560
That's lovely.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.560
You know, I look at all these things.

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:43.560
And now when my grandchildren, well, and my two, went into Newport to schools,

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:47.560
because they took the boundary, took us in, just up the road,

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:52.560
I didn't realise till my boy went to school.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.560
He is 53 this time and my girl's 49.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.560
Yeah, it is, I can't think.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.560
You forget, don't you?

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:04.560
It's a different world.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.560
Completely different world.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:14.560
Because, how can I put it, they wasted too much.

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:18.560
I used to love going to the jumble sales at the school

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:23.560
because they'd throw out a skirt because the zip had gone.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.560
Beautiful clothes.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.560
And you get it for 10p.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:33.560
I'd come home, you know, only had to put a zip in.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:37.560
You know, but it was a completely different way of living.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:41.560
And I didn't realise that until they started school.

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.560
Would you say yours was a very outdoor life?

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:49.560
Yes, outdoor, but you didn't waste anything, get me?

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.560
I mean, even to making cake and all that,

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:58.560
you used a, what was there, I mean, if the cream went a little bit sour,

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:04.560
you put it in a cake or in a scone, it'd make a lovely light scone.

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:08.560
Not really gone off, you know, but just not tainted.

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:12.560
I still use yogurts or whatever now.

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:16.560
If a yogurt is out of date, as long as it hasn't blown, it goes in a cake.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.560
That's lovely.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:22.560
Where did your milk come from? Did you buy milk?

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.560
No, we always had a house cow.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:30.560
Where the calf and Dad milked it or my brothers milked it,

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.560
or I've had a milk sometimes, you know.

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:37.560
If they weren't yearning, every morning the cow read the calf.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.560
But you had the milk first, you didn't let them run free.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.560
The calf was in the pen and you had your milk.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.560
Did you make butter and cheese?

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:52.560
Yes, still got the churn, the old wooden churn and the glass churn is still here.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.560
Did you ever have to do that?

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.560
So once you made the butter, where did you...?

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:03.560
I got the pats and all, you were in it with, you know, you pat the...

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.560
Yeah?

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.560
Yeah.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.560
Gosh.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.560
Yeah, it's...

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:12.560
This is what I think a lot of my grandchildren are losing out,

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:17.560
because they think you buy everything out of a shop.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:20.560
I'm sorry.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.560
They're on the farm but they go to town schools.

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.560
Yeah.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.560
What about pig? Did you have a family pig?

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.560
Yes, yeah, we had a pig.

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:33.560
And Dad used to kill a lamb, which he shared.

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:38.560
There were three of them, Mr. Waters up the road and what you call over there.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:42.560
Well, he was another Mr. Waters, but he won a relation.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.560
It's strange.

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:48.560
And my grandmother was a Waters, but she was relations to only one of them.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:54.560
We're all really on the moors mixed up with one another on the farm.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:57.560
I don't think they travel very far.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:01.560
What about... So you know you've got reams all around you.

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.560
From an early age were you told to keep away from them?

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:05.560
Yes.

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.560
What did your parents say?

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:15.560
They'd tell us never play near a ream, because if you fall in you might not get out.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:19.560
Because some of the reams have got a base around you.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:23.560
They're not all clay. Well, people suck you down.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:27.560
And you were never to play near a ream.

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:31.560
Never to talk to strangers, but I never seen any strangers.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.560
Oh, yeah.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.560
Because you knew everybody.

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:39.560
And Dad used to cut people's hair.

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.560
And he'd come in and say, oh, yes, he'd trim the...

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.560
I still got his cutters in the old drawer outside.

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:50.560
Really, Cuff? So people would come to your kitchen and he would cut their hair?

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.560
Yeah.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.560
What, quite regularly?

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:54.560
Yeah.

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.560
I'll always remember.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:59.560
Just men or women's?

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.560
Oh, Dad done women too. He used to cut mine.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:08.560
But he did do the next door neighbors and a couple, you know, they'd come and he'd do it.

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:13.560
Never had no training, but he'd cut the hair, the hand clippers and all that.

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:20.560
And it's ever so funny because on a Sunday morning, this man used to come to dinner every Sunday.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:24.560
I didn't know who he was, because you had to be...

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.560
I was being about six then, I expect.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.560
Seen but not heard?

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:34.560
Yeah. So you didn't ask questions, but they didn't talk a lot then, did they?

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:37.560
Our mother didn't seem to talk a lot.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:44.560
And he'd be here every Sunday to dinner and I'd think, oh.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:48.560
Then Mum said to him, now that's your Uncle Morgan.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:55.560
Well, I had an auntie Claire up the road, no relation, and Auntie Annis and all those, no relations with her.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:59.560
And Uncle Morgan, asked me, Uncle Morgan.

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.560
Why wonder where does he live?

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:08.560
Well, every Sunday he was at dinner with our mam.

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.560
It turned out he was our mam's brother.

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.560
Really?

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:17.560
Yeah. He said, you're coming home with me today?

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.560
Am I?

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:24.560
Yeah, you can go. You can go, because Auntie Anna wants to see you.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:29.560
Oh. Well, we peddled all up the moor.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:34.560
He lived at Land of Any, right by the railway line, where the bridge goes off.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:39.560
Was it Whitehall, the farm right by the railway line?

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.560
Well, he lived right by there.

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:48.560
Well, we'd go and sit in the house, but he had eight children.

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.560
Wow.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:55.560
I stayed there. I wonder why mam had packed my...

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:03.560
It was then when I found out he was mam's brother.

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:07.560
Because mamma never told me, should you go in and stay up there? So that was my holiday then.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.560
It was your holiday, how funny.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:14.560
Yeah. And I had a couple of days up there.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:21.560
And then we peddled up like that. Well, he'd already told me that I was their cousin, and you know.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:25.560
We slept three in a bed.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:29.560
Two on that end, one at the other end, you know.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.560
The girls and me.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:34.560
Had you peddled everywhere in those days, Michael?

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:43.560
Yeah. But what I couldn't cope with, because the house was so near the railway line, and we are so quiet here,

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:47.560
oh, those blooming trains, they'd rattle by.

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.560
Would they be the steam train then?

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:54.560
Yeah, but they'd be going quite fast, and they'd carry on talking.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:34:05.560
But I couldn't hear a thing. They must have got oblivious to the noise, and they'd be talking away, and I couldn't hear a thing.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:09.560
And in bed at night, there weren't many at night, mind.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:18.560
I suppose today there's trains all the time, but you go to bed and you hear, oh, this blooming train, you hear it coming down the line, you know.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:27.560
And it'd be more or less the house was only like from here to that wall over there from the actual train.

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:34.560
But that man that came in every Sunday was Mums Weather.

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:38.560
So as a child, what sort of games did you play?

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:47.560
Opscotch, skipping, climbing trees, falling out many a time.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.560
Did you ever swim in the reams despite being a cockatoo?

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.560
No.

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.560
No boating or jumping over them?

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:59.560
No, except that day when my two brothers trod on my hands going over.

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:02.560
What about the sea wall? Did you ever go down there?

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:09.560
No, that was the walk from school, our nature walk from school.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:10.560
Yeah.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:14.560
Because you never went like they do abroad and all they do today.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:21.560
You either went down a lane, you went up the sea wall, or you took nature walks.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.560
So what did you do on the sea wall?

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.560
There's a little bit of sand on the one side.

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:30.560
You'd walk in, the fisheries used to be there, they used to catch the fish, look.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:31.560
Yeah.

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:35.560
And then you'd walk in there and play on this little bit of sand.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:41.560
And there was always tea rooms down there because there used to be a big house called the Temporous Hotel.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.560
A three-storey house at the sea wall, they took it down.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:45.560
Where was that?

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:51.560
Right as you drive down to the, go down the sea, right to the sea wall as far as you can go.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.560
You don't mean Porton?

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:54.560
No, no.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.560
The actual Clifton Court one.

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.560
Oh, the little cafe there?

00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.560
Yeah.

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:03.560
Well, the cafe used to be in the house before that.

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:04.560
Yeah.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:05.560
When I was a kid.

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:06.560
Yeah.

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:10.560
But there was a house the other side right on the sea wall, Temporous Hotel it was called.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.560
I've not heard of that before.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.560
Yeah, I remember Temporous.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.560
Yeah, three-storey house.

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:19.560
Newtons lived in it, Mr. and Mrs. Newton, Bill Newton lived in it.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:20.560
Really?

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.560
And there's another story.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:29.560
If you go over the New Southern Bridge and you come to England, as you look on the left,

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:32.560
there's a house there, three-storey, exactly the same as the one that used to be down there.

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.560
They took it down.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:34.560
Down there.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.560
Really?

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.560
Yeah, you'll see it on the left-hand side.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:40.560
They took it down because they wanted to do something to the sea wall and they moved it.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.560
Yeah, when they widened the wall, yeah.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.560
Wait a minute.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:45.560
70s?

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.560
70-something?

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:48.560
Yes.

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:52.560
Well, she was still living in the whole house when her son got lost on the Southern Bridge.

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:53.560
70-something?

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:54.560
What, he got lost in 60-something?

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.560
He got lost?

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.560
What do you mean?

00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:03.560
Well, he was working on the Southern Bridge and he was getting in his car on the... he'd

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:04.560
finished his shift.

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.560
Yeah.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:09.560
And an alarm went off and he rushed back in and he got in the boats and he never ever found

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.560
his body.

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:13.560
They reckoned he'd got under one of the other boats or something.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.560
There's a thing about it on the telly.

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:17.560
Oh yeah, there was a program on it about telly.

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:18.560
Really?

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.560
It was the only funeral I remember my dad going to.

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:22.560
Oh, sorry.

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:26.560
No, my brother's going to where there was no body.

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:32.560
Mam's sister lived the other way on the sea wall then.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.560
Yeah.

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:41.560
But when she was ill, she'd give me two and sixpence anti-D.E.C. did to go and do her ironing.

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:47.560
So I used to ride down to Mrs. Newton's and walk the sea wall all the way down there to

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.560
do her ironing and come back.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:54.560
Two and sixpence if she had a lot of ironing, two shillings if it was a small iron.

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.560
So, it depended on...

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:59.560
How far along the sea wall did you...

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.560
Oh, Grimineck, Mildermore.

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.560
Really?

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:06.560
You walked, yeah, to there, come back, pedal my back home.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:10.560
So the Temperance Hotel, was it a hotel?

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:11.560
People would go there...

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.560
At one stage, but not when Newton's was there.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.560
Yeah.

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:22.560
Mrs. Newton, who used to wait, I used to put my bike in her coal house in her shed on the

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:27.560
side, and she'd wait until I'd come back, see me walk back along the sea wall and have

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:30.560
a few words with me and I'd pedal home then.

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:31.560
Really?

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:32.560
But you knew everybody, see?

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:33.560
Yeah.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.560
And Mam used to go there.

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:41.560
Well then, Auntie Daisy moved from there then, and she moved where Margaret Russell used

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.560
to live on the Cardcliffe and Court.

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:45.560
Oh, really?

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:46.560
Um...

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:49.560
She moved there.

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:54.560
Did you ever go out into the estuary and walk out there or swim in the river there?

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.560
No, we used to walk out, but I tell you what, we used to go more than anywhere.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.560
It was down...

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.560
Oh, not Saltmash, there was a lot of grass.

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:04.560
Yeah.

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.560
Oh, what's that lane where you go to Nash Church?

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:08.560
Walk on down there.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.560
Oh, I know where you go, yeah.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:15.560
And down there, there was a lot of grass.

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:16.560
Yeah.

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:20.560
And it was lovely to go and you could watch the ships come in through the dock down there,

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.560
look.

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:22.560
Oh, really?

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.560
You'd be watching the ships coming into the dock.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.560
Yeah.

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:30.560
And then we used to have a ride sometimes on our bikes, because you never took shopping

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:33.560
with your mam in those days, right?

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:40.560
And to see the shops when I was about 13, we used to go over the transporter bridge,

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.560
pedal our bikes up the main street of town.

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.560
Pedal your bikes to Newport?

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:51.560
Yeah, we'd pedal our bikes down where the transporter bridge is in Traston Road.

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.560
And you went across on the transporter bridge?

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.560
Up where the cross on the transporter bridge.

00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:01.560
Pedal our bikes up town, looking in the shop windows, right?

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:02.560
Yeah.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:08.560
And then come on along down Chepstral Road, turn off at the crosshands and pedal on.

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:11.560
And that was not everything, it was only in the summer.

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.560
You'd see lovely shoes, you'd see everything, you know.

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:18.560
But you had to have plain Jane when you went to school, didn't you?

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.560
Oh my God, that's such a lovely story.

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:26.560
We used to have fun as kids, I mean, we had no money.

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.560
No money, no?

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.560
Were there any shops in the parish?

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.560
Yes, sure, shop on the end of Straits Lane.

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:43.560
And there was one down by Eskmouth, it was a post office, Thomas's, Moorcroft.

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:54.560
And there was one in Whitsun, yeah, she used to do post office and pension, she didn't have a shop.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.560
She just had the actual pensions.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.560
And the post got delivered and the post lady had pedaled around with mail.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:01.560
Really?

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:05.560
Yeah, get delivered there, I mean, they'd pedaled around with the mail.

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:10.560
Our mail used to come from Lamburn, yeah, they'd come over the railway line.

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.560
Really?

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:17.560
Yeah, there was a railway line there, look, you could go up there, pedal over and get over into Langston if you wanted to.

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:22.560
Do you remember the butcher ranks out there at Porton?

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:23.560
Yes.

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.560
Yes?

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.560
Yes, yes, I remember all those.

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:29.560
My cousin used to fetch the salmon in.

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:30.560
Who's your cousin?

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.560
Baker, oh he's been dead years now.

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:37.560
That was Auntie Daisy, used to go and do the ironing is, right there, yeah.

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:49.560
And I tell you who used to do it here at the seawall down here, it all belonged to the same fishing, Burgess I think used, and then Williams's, it was Burgess.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.560
Yeah, I've heard the name Burgess.

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:54.560
And then I think Williams's bought it after he died.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:58.560
Yes, because they had, he's still living down there, one of the Williams's.

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.560
Really, yeah, Adrian Williams.

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.560
That's it, yes, he's living down there.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.560
Yeah.

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:10.560
I've seen him for years, and then Martin Hazel lives in Hill Farm, on the top.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:15.560
Hazel's origin, his father and my, his mother and my father are first cousins.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.560
Oh really?

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.560
Yeah, I told you they didn't go very far did they?

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:19.560
No.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:20.560
She was a hale.

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.560
So your cousin used to fetch the salmon?

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:36.560
Yeah, well he used to go out with a little tractor to fetch it in, and in the house there where he lived, down Auntie Daisy, right by there, they had slabs, called slabs.

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:37.560
Yeah.

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:45.560
And they'd put the, he'd go and get them out of the pouches and then put them in his place for them to come and collect.

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:46.560
Oh my goodness.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:50.560
The salmon, see the salmon there, they look nice too.

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:51.560
So was this at Goldcliff?

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.560
That was at Goldcliff.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:53.560
Yeah.

00:42:53.560 --> 00:43:00.560
Well then what you call owls used to do it at, by Hazel's, then by Williams's.

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:04.560
What you call, not Tudor owls.

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:05.560
Windham.

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:06.560
Windham owls.

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:07.560
Did you know him?

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:08.560
Yes.

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:09.560
Really?

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:13.560
Yes, yeah he was lovely, he knew us all, he did.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:16.560
What was he like, because I got some photographs of him.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:17.560
Yeah.

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:18.560
Erm.

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.560
Is that all he did, was he just a fisherman?

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:26.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Windham yeah, father than that.

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:29.560
Did you ever get fish from there, or did you ever fish?

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.560
No, no.

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:39.560
The only fishing I ever done was, well we lost it all now when the steel has come.

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.560
My father used to like eels.

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:42.560
Yes.

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:48.560
So the bean sticks that he used to get, the stick for the runner beans, you'd add a bit

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:54.560
of wire on it and a nook, stick it in the bank and then go back at night to see if you caught

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:55.560
any in the rain.

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:56.560
Yeah.

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:58.560
Oh yeah, I used to catch them like fun.

00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.560
Really?

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:04.560
Yeah, and I tell you what we used to see, and I don't know whether they're there now,

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:09.560
down the bottom of Chappel Ream before it goes out to sea, right, you'd see bunches

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.560
of eels, you know they.

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:12.560
Elvers.

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.560
Elvers, yeah, they'd be there in bunches.

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:17.560
Yes, I've heard this.

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:18.560
Yeah.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:19.560
But you could see them.

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:20.560
Oh yeah, they were like.

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:21.560
Like big club flat.

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:23.560
Really?

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:24.560
Yeah, oh aye.

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.560
So you used to go and watch that?

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:27.560
Yeah.

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:31.560
Well the thing is, what else was there to watch around you?

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:35.560
Did anyone ever eat Elvers here?

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.560
Not the Elvers, but Dad liked the eels.

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:41.560
So when he caught the eel, did he bring it back?

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:44.560
I'd go down and look and fetch it back, Rod as well.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.560
You'd fetch it back?

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.560
Rod as well, only on the end of our road.

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.560
Yeah?

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:51.560
Yeah.

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:52.560
How many would you have, just the one?

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:58.560
Well if you took three bean sticks down with you and he'd come and show you how to push

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:03.560
it in the bank, well then you didn't go back till about two or three hours, and you could

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:04.560
have three.

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:08.560
And he used to love them, Mam used to boil them for him.

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:10.560
So did she skin them first?

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:11.560
Yeah.

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:16.560
She'd have an old sink outside where she'd put them in.

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:18.560
Oh, and she boiled them?

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:19.560
Mm-mm.

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:22.560
Don't ask me how she'd done it, but she boiled them.

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:26.560
So did that stop when landlorn went up?

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:33.560
It went, well yes you got dirt would come in the water, which he said they wouldn't

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:35.560
pollute, but they did.

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:39.560
And you could go out sometimes and they'd have something burst over there.

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:44.560
Oh, I mean, did they have arsenic or cyanide over there?

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:47.560
And all the fish would be up on top of the water dead.

00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:48.560
You actually saw that?

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.560
Really?

00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:50.560
Yeah.

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:56.560
And that was in Monks Pill, and, because like Monks Pill joins us down here look, just down

00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:57.560
the road.

00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:58.560
Yeah.

00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:01.560
And, yeah, they'd be floating on top of the water.

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:05.560
They'd had a leak, didn't they, or something over there, and nobody's seen anything would

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:06.560
they?

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.560
Do you remember when landlorn was being constructed?

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:09.560
Yeah.

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.560
What was that like?

00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:18.560
Terrible for us along here, because the lorries, which was all in the shale and all that, you'd

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:23.560
see, well it wasn't safe to go out on the roads really, because they'd be coming up

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.560
fast.

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:29.560
They'd be in hedges, they'd be everywhere.

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:34.560
You'd see a lorry, they did, you'd see, you know, they were everywhere.

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:38.560
And you didn't want to go into the main of Newport, because there was only one bridge

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.560
then, look, which was the old bridge.

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:41.560
Oh my gosh.

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:45.560
Not the George Street Bridge, and we've got City Bridge now.

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:52.560
So you could be queuing way down on Corporation Road, or Chepster Road, because the lorries

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.560
took over.

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:59.560
And then you had to camp up the road, yeah, with all the Irishmen.

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:00.560
Really?

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.560
Yeah.

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:07.560
You know where NRW is now, well, Caldercott and Wendtl was, but just up the road there,

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:10.560
coming towards me on the left-hand side, there was an hostel there.

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:15.560
There was even a church they put in there for the Irishmen, they were all Irish.

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.560
Really?

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.560
Mm-hmm.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:22.560
They were there building, they were the main ones on the stewardess, and they'd go to

00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:32.560
a town on a Friday night, come home drunk, and the old, no, I don't call them, a priest

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:36.560
would be collecting them up, because there used to be a garage there selling petrol where

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:39.560
NRW is now, German's Garage.

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:40.560
Really?

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:46.560
When we had a car then, we picked our petrol up there, and he used to shoe horses as well

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:47.560
for anybody to ride.

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:54.560
He had his thing in the back, Mr. German did, where he showed the horses, and he had two

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:55.560
petrol pumps there.

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:56.560
Wow.

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.560
And behind that was the hostel.

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:02.560
Just, you know where Geoff said he was born, that farm opposite?

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:03.560
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:08.560
And that side of the road, just around the bend, you'll see like a lot of rubble now.

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:09.560
Yeah.

00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:11.560
And that was the hostel where the Irishmen was.

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:14.560
And they had a little church there as well?

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:20.560
Yeah, and they used to go to town, get drunk, and oh, it was, you never come along that

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:23.560
road on a Saturday night because they'd be all over the road.

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.560
Oh.

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:28.560
And the priest would be rounding them up and taking them in.

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:30.560
I've not heard that before.

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:31.560
Yes.

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.560
Where?

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:38.560
Up on that road, near a new port, there was a caravan site for the workers on the steelworks.

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:39.560
Really?

00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:40.560
Yeah.

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:46.560
And they had a church up on there as well, and a supermarket, like not today, like a

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:47.560
corp on there.

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:48.560
Yeah.

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.560
I used to go in and get stuff, and a post office and all that.

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.560
Oh my goodness.

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:55.560
That must have been, do you remember the village of Lambwine?

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:56.560
Yes.

00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:57.560
What was it like?

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:00.560
Well, by the, do you know where the golf club is?

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:01.560
Yeah.

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.560
Well, that Tennyson Avenue, was it?

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:08.560
Or Tennyson Road, I think, because we used to pedal our bikes over the railway.

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:09.560
Did you?

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:13.560
And then go up around the Martin and come back home along the moor.

00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:16.560
Well, there was nowhere else to go, you know.

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:17.560
Yes.

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:20.560
And then there was Banffam.

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:24.560
We used to turn up by there, but like the little village was there by the Milton and

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:27.560
all that, and few around by there.

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:30.560
Do you know anyone who worked there at Lambwine?

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:33.560
Did it employ a lot of local people?

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:34.560
Yes.

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:40.560
I mean, a lot of people from around here worked when the work started, you know.

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:43.560
But it was mainly the Irish that was...

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:46.560
That Irish Navvies that were building it.

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:47.560
Yeah.

00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:48.560
Yeah.

00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:49.560
Oh my gosh.

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:52.560
What about, so you were born in 41?

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:53.560
41, January.

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:56.560
Do you remember the winter of 47?

00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:57.560
Yes.

00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:03.560
Yes, where the sheep, we had snow, a bad winter, and you'd go out in the field out there and

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:07.560
all you'd see was the poor sheep and their nostrils showing.

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:13.560
And Dad used to, and Uncle and my two brothers, not me, because I mean, the snow was...

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:14.560
Yeah.

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:15.560
Oh, I remember that well.

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:16.560
Wow.

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:17.560
Was it cut off here then?

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:18.560
Yeah.

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.560
Yes, we were cut off.

00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:21.560
Gosh.

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:24.560
And was it the same in 63?

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:25.560
That's another bad winter.

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:27.560
That was another one, yes.

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:32.560
We could get from here with a tractor then, because you had tractors then, you know.

00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.560
So you got from here.

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:39.560
I mean, you didn't go out there, you went and did any shopping.

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:40.560
So in 47 was it...

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:44.560
But in those days, see, you had shopping.

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:48.560
There was a lot more local shops than there is now.

00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:49.560
Yeah.

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:55.560
So, Mum would go up as far as Kendal's, which was only opposite Lissowerry High School,

00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:57.560
where my grandkids go.

00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:58.560
Yeah.

00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.560
Well, and where they went.

00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:01.560
There was the shop there.

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:02.560
Yeah.

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:07.560
Kendal's had that shop, and he had the shop farther up, and then the baker was on that

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:08.560
roundabout by Aldi's.

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:09.560
Oh, really?

00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:10.560
The baker.

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:15.560
So you only had to get on the tractor then, you could go in 63, and get the bread out

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:18.560
of the bakehouse there.

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:21.560
Mr. Haynes was there, and you'd get the bread off him.

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:22.560
Yeah.

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:26.560
I can remember all that before the school was built up there and all.

00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:28.560
Lissowerry School College and all that.

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:32.560
So all that area, and the area where all that shopping centre is, you know...

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:33.560
Yeah, it was all farmland.

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:35.560
That was all farmland.

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:37.560
That's hard to believe, isn't it?

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:38.560
It is.

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:44.560
And when I look at how Newport have grown in all ways, do you know what I mean?

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:45.560
Yeah, yeah.

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:52.560
And I'm thinking, well, it was only those houses on Nash Road, as I call Nash Road by

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:55.560
Lissowerry, there was only the houses there.

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:57.560
There was nothing behind them.

00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:01.560
Now there's all Pont Fein, what do you call it, Crescent, the other side.

00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:03.560
No, that was all land.

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:07.560
Well, that was wartime buildings on that side of the road.

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:08.560
You know those banglows?

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:09.560
Yeah.

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:10.560
What do you call them?

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.560
Prefabs.

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:12.560
Prefabs.

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:15.560
They were there, and another lot on Chepstow Road.

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:21.560
But I can remember when I used to go to school, none of Allway or all that was ever built.

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:22.560
So it was all farmland?

00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:23.560
All farmland, yes.

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:27.480
The head of the

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:32.560
There was the Endrew Farm up there, on the left, when you went up there, yeah.

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:35.560
Because they were butchers in the town.

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:38.560
Auntie Rose Thompson.

00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:42.560
No relation of ours, but I just had to call her Auntie Rose because she's mam's friend.

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:47.560
So you're only 78, which isn't that old, and you've seen all these changes.

00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:48.560
Yeah.

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:51.560
There was none of those houses there when I went to school.

00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:53.560
So it was a very rural area.

00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:58.560
Yeah, it was all rural right up, yeah.

00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:03.560
So did the M4 coming through affect you at all here? Was that noticed?

00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:05.560
No, it was noticed.

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:06.560
Yeah.

00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:15.560
But that you got off at Magor and then you was like, but the other one that will come through will come not far from Pike Corner, won't it? If it comes.

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:16.560
If it comes through.

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:17.560
If it comes through.

00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:19.560
What do you think about that?

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:26.560
Well, we do need something in Newport because we're gridlocked only nearly all the time now.

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:32.560
You can be queuing back to Pike Corner to get into town if you don't go early.

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:33.560
Yes.

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:40.560
But I think what done that was, they put that road through Lanwerne.

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:43.560
Well, it brought the traffic quicker, didn't it?

00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:44.560
Yeah.

00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:50.560
I mean, instead of coming along this road, they come straight through now.

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:56.560
And I think it's quicker. It's got to the bridge and it's jamming us up.

00:53:56.560 --> 00:54:00.560
Do you know what? You see coaches come along our top road now sometimes.

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:01.560
What, to avoid the traffic?

00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:02.560
To avoid the traffic.

00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:11.560
To avoid the traffic, but they're not getting anywhere because they only turn and before you turn back to go back on or go straight up, you're queuing.

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:12.560
It's crazy.

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:18.560
It took me to go to the school. Well, Lane took me up to school because they had a concert on.

00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:25.560
She took the kids up. She said, Mom, hurry up. You're going to have to wait. Come quickly. She said, because we're going queuing.

00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:32.560
It took us three quarters of an hour to do two and a half miles to get to the school.

00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:36.560
It's off walking, aren't you? Really? Or cycling?

00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:37.560
Or cycling.

00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:40.560
Do you know what? I haven't cycled a bike for years. I don't know.

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:43.560
What about the trains? Did you ever use trains as a child?

00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:52.560
Yes. Dad had to go to Gloucester, look. Pedal up to Lanwerne Station on the bike, get on the train there to Gloucester and do the same coming home.

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.560
Gloucester Market was right by the railway lines in Gloucester, look.

00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:57.560
So I know where Gloucester Market is.

00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:06.560
Oh, where it is now. Oh, where it used to be in the town. Yeah, when Dad would get off the train and you only sort of come down, you were in the market.

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:08.560
So what if he bought anything?

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:12.560
Oh, there was always a cattle lorry. No, he didn't have a cattle lorry in the beginning.

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:15.560
But in the beginning, did they come back on the train with him?

00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:28.560
No. There was a lorry from this area. It was either Mr Arthur, Mr Rees or who else used to fetch it down. But there was always a lorry to bring whenever he bought home.

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:30.560
And would you ever go with him to Gloucester?

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:31.560
Yeah.

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:32.560
Really?

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:34.560
Yeah, Mam used to want to get rid of me, didn't she?

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:36.560
So you were both cycled to...

00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:39.560
Lanwerne. Put our bikes in the station.

00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:42.560
Were they trained up then or would you just leave them there?

00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:52.560
No, put them in a little hut in there. And then you'd go on the train, look all the way. Well, Dad had a cousin living just outside Gloucester.

00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:53.560
Yeah.

00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:54.560
In Minsterworth.

00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:55.560
Minsterworth?

00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:56.560
Yeah.

00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:57.560
I was brought up in Minsterworth.

00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:58.560
Were you?

00:55:58.560 --> 00:55:59.560
Yeah, where in Minsterworth?

00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:04.560
Erm, what's the name of it? Well, Harvey's the name was. Do you remember Harvey's?

00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:05.560
Not John Harvey.

00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:07.560
Harvey's the poet?

00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:11.560
No, there was a John and Agnes Harvey who used to run the shop in Minsterworth by the butchers.

00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:18.560
Hunter Gladys she was. She was Dad's first cousin.

00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:19.560
Oh, that's really funny.

00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:21.560
And erm...

00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:24.560
It's on the River Severn.

00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:35.560
Yeah. And she'd come into Gloucester and pick me up and take me back there. And fetch me back if I wanted to come back. She didn't have any children. She was married late in life.

00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:37.560
But her brother was Harvey the poet.

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:39.560
Harvey the poet? Who's he?

00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:42.560
Yeah, he was a soldier. Remember he was the soldier poet?

00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:43.560
Oh really?

00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:47.560
And he's buried in... yeah, the church up there.

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:49.560
That's amazing.

00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:52.560
I've got his poetry books upstairs.

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:53.560
Have you?

00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:54.560
Yeah.

00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:56.560
So this was, well this would have been a steam train and...

00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:04.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go to Gloucester. Dad had fall asleep. It used to worry me. Because I think, well how do you know to get off?

00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:06.560
It was a station. Oh my gosh.

00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:09.560
Yeah, I used to go with him regularly to Gloucester.

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:12.560
What about the Severn Bridge? Do you remember when that was opened?

00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:14.560
Yes, I remember it being built.

00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:15.560
Do you?

00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:16.560
Yeah.

00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:21.560
Because I would have been about 17 would I then? No.

00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:26.560
Yeah. And does it make a big... I mean what do you remember about it being built?

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:31.560
Erm... remember that you could go over the other side of the water.

00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:32.560
Yeah.

00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:38.560
Without going all the way up around. Or unless you went over on the...

00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:39.560
Severn Tunnel?

00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:47.560
Yeah. Or... Williamson's Down here used to have a... what do you call it? Take you across on the water. A boat.

00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:48.560
Really?

00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:49.560
Yeah.

00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:50.560
Where from?

00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:59.560
From Chesby. Where the Severn Bridge was. It went down... because I went to school in Chesby. Look, see? So I know all Bullwok and all that.

00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:02.560
And you could take your car on this boat.

00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:03.560
Yeah.

00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:06.560
Oh, God, what was it called?

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:07.560
Not Oust.

00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:09.560
Oust?

00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:12.560
Port Scuett.

00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:14.560
No, farther up than that.

00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:15.560
Sadbrook.

00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:19.560
No, farther up. It was in Chepstow. It was...

00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:28.560
Well, once the Severn Bridge got built, you know, people never used it. It was like transporting you from this side to the other.

00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:33.560
You drove your car on it and you'd go over the other. It might have been Oust. He was on...

00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:36.560
Yeah, I think there is a famous Oust it is.

00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:42.560
What was it like going across? Because it looks a bit precarious in photographs I've seen.

00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:43.560
I only went over once.

00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:44.560
Really?

00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:55.560
And that was with Geoff's auntie. She took us over on this boat. Well, and drove the car on it. If you went up and it was on it.

00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:57.560
So you said that Williams, they live around here?

00:58:57.560 --> 00:58:58.560
Well, that is the Williams.

00:58:58.560 --> 00:58:59.560
Oh, the Andrean Williams?

00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:00.560
Yeah, his father had it.

00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:02.560
Ah, right, okay.

00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:08.560
He's only moved down here since they sold that up there. Look, he hadn't always been down here. No, it's only like late turn.

00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:15.560
Ah, what about... Would you know the names of all the reams on your land?

00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:18.560
Yes.

00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:19.560
You do? Yeah.

00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:20.560
Yes.

00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:21.560
And what, further afield?

00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:23.560
As far as Redwick.

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:25.560
As far as... Do you?

00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:26.560
Yeah.

00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:31.560
So when you're driving along in your car, could you say, oh, that's such and such and that's such and such?

00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:32.560
Yeah.

00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:35.560
Could you? That's really impressive.

00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:38.560
Yeah, because, like, Dad was from Redwick.

00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:39.560
Yeah.

00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:49.560
Um, I suppose Redwick, although I've always lived here, born here and all that, I've always got a love for Redwick.

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:55.560
I suppose because Dad's... My two brothers are buried here. One is buried over here, don't they?

00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:57.560
Did you marry there?

00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:00.560
Yes. Yes, in Redwick Church.

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.560
Do you remember the shop then? The little shop?

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.560
Yes, on the bottom by the crossroads.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:10.560
Yeah, run by one of the howls, was it?

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:16.560
Yes. Now... Hang on.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:22.560
Um, yes, Howells's mother had it, wasn't it? Mrs. Howells's mother.

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:25.560
Mrs. Howells's grandmother. Duck Howells's grandmother, I think, had it.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:26.560
Yeah.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.560
I think, or something like that.

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:32.560
Now, wasn't the daughter there adopted or a niece?

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.560
Yes. Yes. His mother was adopted, yeah.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.560
Yeah, that's it.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:36.560
Yeah.

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.560
What was her name?

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:45.560
Oh, I used to go to that shop because when I said to you about Auntie Daisy, if on light nights you were in the shop,

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:52.560
you know, you could walk across the Islet ground, as I call it, up Mead Lane.

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:53.560
Yeah.

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:57.560
And then you came out by the church and then just walked along there.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:03.560
And then she'd buy me some sweets and we'd get her a bit of shopping, then we'd walk back down the Islet.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:07.560
And I tell you what we used to do, I don't know if we're allowed to do it today.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:11.560
In the Islet ground, there were lovely cow slips.

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:15.560
Cow slips. So I always used to pick a bunch of cow slips from them.

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.560
But you're not supposed to pick them today, are you?

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:19.560
Oh, really? How lovely.

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:25.560
Oh, it was full of cow slips. The Island ground was, and the Island ground is right at the bottom.

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:34.560
When Mead Lane comes into the steelworks, which they made the road down there, you just go that way, through that gateway,

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:37.560
and two fields in was the Island ground.

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:38.560
The Highland ground?

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:40.560
Yeah, it was called the Island ground.

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:41.560
Why was it called that?

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:45.560
Well, it had a little bit of a mound in it or something.

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.560
And they picked some cow slips when they were out.

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:51.560
Never dug any up mine or nothing like that.

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:54.560
But you're not supposed to pick them today, are you?

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.560
I mowed some in my garden the other day.

01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:59.560
Well, they were just going over.

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:04.560
Oh, going over. But I don't think you're supposed to pick them though.

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:06.560
Oh, you lovely, lovely, pretty, fetch on for a man.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.560
They were so pretty. I used to suck the honey out of them.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.560
Oh yes, you could, yeah.

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:20.560
Oh, there are other things, like wildlife and things that you used to see when you were a child that you don't see now at the levels.

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:23.560
For example, I've spoken to people who...

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:27.560
Curly, I don't think I see so much as I used to. You know, they had a...

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:29.560
Yeah.

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:32.560
I don't see so much of them.

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:33.560
Hairs?

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.560
Oh, I've got quite a few hairs.

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:36.560
Oh, yeah.

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.560
Oh, that's lovely. Oh, that's lovely.

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:44.560
I love them. And they seem to...

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:49.560
Well, they do breed in where you leave a little bit of long grass.

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:59.560
And we've always left at the bottom, and by the 10 acres, a little bit of long grass and tidy grass.

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:02.560
It looks untidy, but it's left there.

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:05.560
Because that's where...

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:09.560
I don't see so many partridges as we used to, neither.

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:10.560
Yeah.

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:14.560
Because they used to hatch a lot on the fields, don't you?

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.560
Oh, really?

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:19.560
Did you ever get otters down here?

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:22.560
We've got otters, yes, but we've got otters coming back now.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.560
Yeah.

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:27.560
I'd seen one the other day in Chaperwene.

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:28.560
Did you?

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:33.560
Apparently, they're... I couldn't make out what it was.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:36.560
I thought, that's not a mink.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:41.560
Because we did have mink, you know, where somebody had let some go or something.

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:42.560
Were they a problem for you?

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:46.560
Yeah, well, they'd get in, and we only got a few chicken.

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:52.560
But, you know, they seemed to burrow their ways into the chicken houses if they got no bones then,

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:55.560
and they couldn't get into any little hole.

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:59.560
We had one, and we only had six chicken hen in a chicken house and killed a lot.

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:00.560
Oh, no.

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:02.560
And we had seen one.

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:07.560
We don't know whether it done it, but we'd seen one coming across our pond,

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:10.560
where they were used on the lane.

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:11.560
And I shut them in.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:17.560
I know I shut the door and all that night and went to let them go next morning.

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:20.560
And they were all dead in there.

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:26.560
No, well, and it was only a little hole about that big that he burrowed through.

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:28.560
Yeah, they're slinky.

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:30.560
Yeah, like if they got no bones.

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:35.560
And we blamed it on the mink anyway.

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:40.560
Did you? I was talking to somebody the other day over towards Peterstone,

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:45.560
and she remembers as a child seeing the otter hounds down there.

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:46.560
Yes.

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.560
Did you ever have them here?

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:56.560
Yes, but they didn't do much good our side because I think our ditches are a bit deeper than the other side.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:03.560
They came twice, the otters, and they didn't have anything.

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:05.560
They didn't see anything, they said.

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:10.560
But I think the ditches are a bit more deeper our side than...

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.560
Do you remember what they wore?

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:17.560
Was it blue and red stockings, I wonder?

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:25.560
Or was it red tops on stockings? Was it all red?

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:30.560
Oh, that's interesting they were here.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.560
What about the beagles?

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:37.560
Yeah, but they're no good from down here because of the water.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.560
Oh, really?

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:42.560
They can't, you know, they can't get going.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:46.560
They do come down Greenmoor, they meet once a year.

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:47.560
Yes.

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:54.560
And that all comes down at Harrison, I think it is, fetches them down.

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:58.560
But they chase, but the fox, they always gets away.

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.560
Because they can jump the water, can't they?

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:06.560
And the owls before they can get whatever they are on the trace, they can't do it, you know.

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:10.560
I mean they couldn't use horses down here, they could only walk in any case.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:15.560
The thing that interests me, Cath, is this area, is that high tide you're below sea level.

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:16.560
Sea level, yeah.

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:19.560
Do you ever think about that? Does it ever worry you?

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.560
No.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:21.560
No?

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.560
Never think about it, no.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:26.560
And have you ever seen floods here?

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:27.560
Yes.

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:28.560
Coming over the wall?

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:33.560
Yes. And we have been flooded here where we couldn't get out.

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:34.560
Really?

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:37.560
One was up to our gate that comes on the back.

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:38.560
Yeah.

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:45.560
And all Chapel Road in the low bits then was all flooded over, you know, we couldn't either...

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:49.560
Yeah, we have been flooded here, but never up to the house.

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:52.560
But we never think of...

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:55.560
Oh, we'd have to get a boat, wouldn't we?

01:06:55.560 --> 01:07:00.560
Never think of being actual flooded.

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:04.560
When was the Great Floods?

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:05.560
Well, you mean...

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:07.560
In the churches and all that.

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:09.560
1606 I think it was.

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:12.560
Yeah, because they say that was a tsunami, don't they, already?

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.560
Yeah.

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.560
Yeah, no, I didn't see that.

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:18.560
So what caused the flood that time then, when you were here?

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:21.560
It was coming over the wall.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:26.560
And I tell you, one day we went up...

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:28.560
Was it Linmouth got flooded?

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:29.560
Yes.

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:35.560
Well, I shouldn't say it, but it was a good job, because that night we went to see it,

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:38.560
because it was lapping over the wall, and we went to see it down the corridor, because

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:43.560
we got land on the corridor, steelworks, you know, which goes to the sea wall.

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:48.560
And we went up there and it was just about to come over the wall.

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:54.560
And then next day, because I thought, oh Jesus, we've got land, we've got cattle down here.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.560
That must be so daunting seeing that.

01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:58.560
I was worried about the cattle, you know.

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:02.560
Well, then next day on the news, when I put on the wireless, Linmouth had had it, and

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:05.560
I thought, oh thank God it went that way and not our way.

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:09.560
Because I mean, we're more or less opposite of it.

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:10.560
Yeah.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:14.560
That we would have had it then, because we went down just to see and sit on the wall

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:19.560
to see what was happening, and it was just about that much starting to...

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:20.560
Yeah.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:25.560
Do you keep an eye on weather conditions then, just in case of the high tides and...

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:29.560
Well, they are looking after us quite well now.

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:30.560
Yeah.

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:35.560
They do put the boards, if it's going to be really to stop it coming up.

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:36.560
Yeah.

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:37.560
But if the boards...

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.560
Well, no, we've got new boards now, haven't we?

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:41.560
Yes, where they wind them.

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:49.560
You could get salt water right up through Chapel Ream when the tides was really going,

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:54.560
when we had the old boards, because I think the weight and the drift of it would move them.

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:58.560
Oh yeah, you get salt water right past us here.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:08:59.560
Really?

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:00.560
Crikey.

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.560
So how far are we from the seawall here?

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:03.560
What would it be?

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.560
About a mile and a half, we're really...

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:06.560
Crikey.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:07.560
Right down the road.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:08.560
Yeah.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:09.560
Yeah, because there's one at the bottom there, isn't there?

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:10.560
The gout.

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:11.560
Yeah.

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.560
Oh no, there's no wall there, is there?

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.560
It's just a filter off, isn't there?

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.560
So do you still have grips on your land?

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:19.560
Yeah.

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:20.560
Yeah.

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:21.560
Still got the old grips.

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.560
We've never been drained, you know.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.560
Because they work effectively for you.

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:28.560
Yeah, when your grip's full up, you know, go on the end.

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:33.560
But I tell them it's the tractors they're driving that cracks the pipes on the end.

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:34.560
Do you think so?

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:37.560
Well, it's got to be weight on it.

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.560
It only used to be cows or horses, didn't it?

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:43.560
Or, well, the tractors are getting heavier and heavier.

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:44.560
And bigger and bigger.

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:45.560
Bigger, yeah.

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:47.560
So in your father's time, was it still horse drawn?

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:48.560
Yeah.

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.560
Do you remember that?

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:50.560
Yeah.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:51.560
Do you?

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:52.560
Yeah, I used to ride the horse.

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:53.560
We had a horse.

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:56.560
They'd make the A-Ricks in the field.

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.560
Yeah.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:00.560
And they used to have a horse in front of it like a wooden sweep.

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:01.560
Yeah.

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:05.560
And they'd row it up and the horse would be pulling it up.

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:07.560
Yeah, Dad used to chuck me on there, put me on their backs.

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:08.560
Really?

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:10.560
To ride the horse down.

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:16.560
So are there any words that you've used around here that might not be used anywhere else?

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.560
I never thought of that.

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:27.560
All traditions or myths or ghost stories or folk stories.

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:30.560
I did love the folk stories.

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:38.560
But I don't know.

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:41.560
Any old characters that you remember around here?

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:47.560
Yes, old Mad Jack, Derby Joe, old Bob Groves.

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:48.560
Who were they?

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:54.560
They used to come around when you were busy and live in your couch head or something like

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:57.560
that and have food and do work on the farms.

01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:58.560
Really?

01:10:58.560 --> 01:10:59.560
Yeah.

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:00.560
Do you know where they...

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:01.560
Bill Newport.

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.560
There was lots of them.

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:08.560
Do you know where they came from or anything like that and their background?

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.560
No.

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:10.560
No?

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:11.560
No.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:15.560
Are you too young to remember the war?

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:17.560
Yeah, I was born in 41.

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:18.560
So you wouldn't remember?

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:21.560
I was born when it was...

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.560
Apparently...

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:26.560
Well, this house here had all the windows...

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:32.560
Bombs dropped on the shed on the end of the house and blew all the windows in.

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:36.560
Mamma always used to...

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.560
Oh, don't it sound daft.

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.560
Put us under the kitchen table.

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:43.560
I've heard that from several people actually.

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.560
But it does sound daft, doesn't it?

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.560
What would the kitchen table do?

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:50.560
And we still got the same table in the kitchen now.

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:51.560
You haven't.

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:52.560
I have.

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:53.560
It was a good table then.

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.560
Yeah, I'll show it to you.

01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:59.560
In my kitchen there, the table...

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:04.560
It's the table I can always remember.

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:05.560
What?

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:10.560
From a kid sat at the same table.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.560
So would you...

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:14.560
We haven't altered it a lot.

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:15.560
Do you know what I mean?

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:16.560
Yeah.

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.560
I've got a junk room upstairs.

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.560
I expect everybody have.

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:25.560
Which...

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:29.560
Lots of things in there.

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:34.560
I got lots of photographs too when I get down to digging around in there.

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:38.560
If you have any photographs, I would love to see them.

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:41.560
Yeah, I got photographs up there.

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:43.560
Yeah, you might need to dig around for them.

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:49.560
Yeah.

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:56.560
So what is it? What's special about this place, this area?

01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:58.560
What's special?

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:00.560
Well, I think it's special because we got...

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:05.560
On the part of the farm here too, we've got an ancient monument where you can't dig.

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:09.560
It's like a tent where they say it was a burial ground.

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:10.560
Really?

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:11.560
So you don't touch it.

01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:15.560
You can't blow it. You don't do anything to it. You can mow it. You can graze it.

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:19.560
But you're not allowed to...

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:20.560
Disturb it?

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:23.560
No, you're not allowed to do a... What do they do? Metal detector?

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.560
You're not allowed to do anything.

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:30.560
That's by the cottage that joins us on the far end of the farm.

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:37.560
Apparently it was the man from the ancient monument's core one day.

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:42.560
And I think he... Yeah, he did. He gave me photographs of what it looked like.

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:43.560
Yeah.

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:45.560
And was it TP's or something?

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:46.560
Yeah.

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:50.560
That was on there. And he said, it's a burial ground there.

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:53.560
And I said, oh!

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:58.560
And laughed. He said, you're not allowed to touch it, he said. You're not allowed to level it off.

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:05.560
The field sort of... It's that high and then it seems to go in a dip.

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.560
I wonder how old is it?

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:08.560
Oh, it's old.

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:09.560
Yeah.

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:12.560
But we're not allowed to touch anything.

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:16.560
He comes and checks the house, mine, because this is a grade two listed building.

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:20.560
Is it? How old is it?

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:24.560
It's on the front. I think a bit was rebuilt. 18 something.

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:26.560
Oh gosh.

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:31.560
Oh yeah, because there, that's got to stay there. Look, that wall there.

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:34.560
That's years ago. They kept cows in there.

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.560
Oh really?

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:36.560
Next door then.

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:37.560
Yeah.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:41.560
And that was, was it a filter through? And you see where the bricks are on the top?

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:42.560
Yeah.

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:45.560
They used to put the fodder out through there to feed the animals the other side of the wall.

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:46.560
Oh my god.

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:48.560
But that's the old beam and...

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:51.560
So that's new, that bit in there?

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:56.560
No, that was the old cellar. Look, the old flagstone stay you got to...

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:57.560
Oh my god.

01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:03.560
The food is there. There's a slab there, look, where they used to salt the...

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:07.560
Yeah, you have to get up. You have to get up.

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:08.560
Isn't that awful?

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:09.560
Just round here?

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:11.560
Yeah, see where the television is?

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.560
Oh, that's where they used to salt the pig?

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:14.560
Yeah.

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:15.560
You still got that?

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:16.560
Yeah.

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:19.560
That's amazing. Wow.

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:20.560
That's the...

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:22.560
Doesn't it have an orchard here?

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.560
Yeah, the orchard's out there.

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:25.560
Is it still there now?

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:26.560
Yeah.

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:27.560
Oh, that is?

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:33.560
Oh my god. When I was a kid there was trees I used to climb up and they're still there.

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:35.560
So...

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:38.560
It's got to be...

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:42.560
I don't know. 70 years or more, isn't it?

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:44.560
So did you ever have a cider press here?

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:48.560
Yeah. Well, yeah, there was a cider press but we used to have a travelling press.

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:53.560
A man come around and do the cider in the front yard, I got photographs of that somewhere.

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.560
Melville Jones.

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:55.560
That's the one!

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:56.560
Yeah.

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.560
Who was he then? Was he a local?

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:05.560
Local and he travelled the press and he'd do it with... they'd pick the apples and they'd put them in and press it down.

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:09.560
The cider went in like a troll. I can remember all that.

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:12.560
Oh, if you find those photographs I would love to see them.

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:13.560
I know, I can.

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:16.560
Yeah. Yeah.

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.560
Give me time.

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:23.560
Is there anything else you'd like to add, Kath?

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:27.560
Oh, I don't think so. I don't know. There's lots of things that you think of them.

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.560
Yeah. Oh, did you ever go to Whitsun Sioux?

01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:33.560
Yes, Mrs Mayberry, Whitsun Sioux, yes.

01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:34.560
It was lovely.

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:35.560
Yeah.

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:36.560
She was a lovely old lady.

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:37.560
Was she?

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:38.560
Oh, she was lovely.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:39.560
Yeah.

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:42.560
And in her latter years she had a deer at the Sioux, right?

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:43.560
Yeah.

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:48.560
And she had to keep it tethered down because every time she'd let it go it landed here with us.

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:50.560
In the end she'd give it to us.

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:51.560
She gave you the deer?

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:57.560
Yeah. Well, it stayed with our cattle. We fed it in the shed and all. It would stay with her.

01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:01.560
And she'd be fed up coming to get it and then they tethered it over there.

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:03.560
But it was coming up here to you?

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:09.560
Yes, it was coming across the hills. Because like the Sioux was already just like there across.

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:10.560
Yeah.

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:17.560
And it stayed with our cattle all the time. And she said in the end, she said, oh, I'm going to give you the deer.

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:24.560
She said, leave it home. And never left us. It died in the shed up the common. Happy with us. Never bothered as long as we were there.

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:32.560
And what used to amuse me, she used to take all, if you had an animal die, you took it over to her and she'd put it into the lions.

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:33.560
She had lions there.

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:35.560
Yes, yes, I heard that, yeah.

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:39.560
But oh, she had to keep these lions in. Oh, a good fence around there, yeah.

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:40.560
Yeah.

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:47.560
But like the old fashioned chain arrows, you know, what they pull behind the level of ground.

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:54.560
And then I'll always remember, she used to open up, we used to get money for the church.

01:17:54.560 --> 01:18:00.560
She did and all that. She'd open one of her rooms and we'd play whist in the house there.

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:07.560
Yeah, about once a month she'd have us playing whist. We'd be playing whist and all the money went to charity.

01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:09.560
She was lovely.

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:10.560
And...

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:12.560
Did you see the lions and the bears there?

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:15.560
Yes. Yeah, well, no, this is what I was going to tell you.

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:22.560
She had, people used to take, they used to have trips out from town, you know, to see them.

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:27.560
Well, of course, she put the two bears together this day when this trip was coming.

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:33.560
Well, they arrived and all of a sudden they started to fight and one nearly killed the other.

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:38.560
But the two bears did together. Oh, she was a lovely lady.

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:43.560
I mean, someone was telling me over at Porton that they could sometimes hear the lion roar.

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:46.560
Yeah, we heard you when the wind was in our direction.

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:47.560
Really?

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:54.560
And she had peacocks and all their luck. Well, you could hear them squawking. Monkeys she had, she had everything.

01:18:54.560 --> 01:19:01.560
And I'll always remember this one day. The monkeys had broke out.

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:02.560
Yeah, yeah.

01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:05.560
Yeah? Well, the vet had to come to shoot them and we were having to...

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:07.560
Who was the vet then?

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:12.560
What are you doing down here with the gun? Why I didn't want to see you, Kathy, he said.

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:18.560
What are you doing? He said, I've got to shoot, there's a couple monkeys up the tree over there.

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:21.560
He said, and I'm going to go shoot these monkeys.

01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:26.560
And we laughed, I didn't believe him. And he said, yeah.

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:31.560
All right, then I said, we'll sit on the road and wait. No, we'll come back along after and see if you had them.

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:36.560
Yeah, you shot him. I said two or three, he chopped these monkeys.

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:37.560
I think Margaret was telling me that.

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:38.560
Yeah.

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:42.560
Just going back to the cider, so did your dad make cider?

01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:43.560
Yeah.

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:44.560
Where did he keep it?

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:54.560
Yeah, where that kitchen is there. That was the cider casks used to be on things and barrels. I still got a couple of them.

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:55.560
Really?

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:57.560
The taps that you tap into the...

01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:00.560
And was it just for your own consumption?

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:12.560
Well, yeah, but everybody had come here and sort of had cider. I can remember about four or five, they'd arrive and they'd be drinking cider and not drunk.

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:13.560
Yeah, just sociable.

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:14.560
Yeah.

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:15.560
Yeah.

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:24.560
And I think, yes, dad used to play, because he used to come from Redwick to you as well.

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:25.560
Yeah.

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:29.560
What did he use to play? A game called Penny something?

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:30.560
Shove Penny.

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:31.560
Shove Penny.

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.560
Really?

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:36.560
And I think they used to play with, you know...

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:40.560
This must have been a fantastic place to grow up in here.

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:42.560
You know, there's lots of things.

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:45.560
He sounds like quite a character.

01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:56.560
Yeah, he was. He went to town, somebody brought a rabbit for me. Oh, hang on, I think it was...

01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:02.560
Oh, I can't think of her name now, but I always wanted a rabbit, right?

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:12.560
So on a Wednesday, he said when he left, he was... this lady, oh, God, I don't know what her name was, bringing me in a rabbit.

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:16.560
Well, dad used to ride his bike to Newport Market, look, before we had a car.

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:17.560
Yeah.

01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:18.560
Right?

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:19.560
Yeah.

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:27.560
Well, it wasn't far up there. And he took a bag with him, or a frame or a bag on the bike, right?

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:30.560
Well, then he'd gone and had a drink in the White Hart pub.

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:31.560
Yeah.

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:42.560
Well, coming home with the rabbit on the bike, he killed my rabbit because he fell off the bike or the bag got caught in the wheel. I cried my eyes out.

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:43.560
Oh, my goodness.

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:44.560
Yeah.

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:45.560
Oh, my goodness.

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:47.560
I shouldn't laugh, really.

01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:53.560
No, I didn't at the time because I broke my heart. I was looking forward to this rabbit. They'd even made me a little wooden hatch.

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:59.560
But the rabbit... I think it had either got caught in the wheel or...

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:00.560
One of the others.

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:01.560
Yeah.

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:02.560
Yeah.

01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:04.560
And he brought the dead rabbit home.

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:05.560
Oh.

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:07.560
Baby chicken in the garden.

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:08.560
Oh, my goodness.

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:11.560
Yeah, oh, hi, the shawls and the rabbit.

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:13.560
So was there a livestock market in Newport?

01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:14.560
Yeah.

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:15.560
Was it a big one?

01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:19.560
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I used to go to it.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.560
Did you cycle with your dad?

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:28.560
Yeah. And then when my two brothers died, look, I was left here then to farm the thing.

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:40.560
And I used to go to the Newport market every Wednesday, take the stock in, you know, in a box to market.

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:45.560
Then they went to Abergavenny, they closed, they went to Abergavenny and now it's Raglan.

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:51.560
But it was a... Yes, because they still got a little bit of the old market. They didn't let them take it down, did they?

01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:53.560
Well, as there was, yeah.

01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:54.560
Yeah.

01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:55.560
Yeah.

01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:56.560
But the docks, did you ever go to the docks?

01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:06.560
Yeah. Yes, because we used to love to go to see the docks on a Sunday because you were allowed in there.

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:07.560
Yes.

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:14.560
And you pedal your bikes, look, and you go and watch the ships and the big ships and nobody ever saw you.

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:15.560
Really?

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:16.560
But now you can't get in there now, can you?

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:17.560
No, it's all securities.

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:18.560
Yeah. Yeah.

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:19.560
It's all securities.

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:31.560
You can't get... I went to a funeral once, but I jibbed on going out on the boat. She wanted her ashes spread out to sea, look, and on the tugboat would they take him out on it?

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:32.560
Yeah.

01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:33.560
Yeah.

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:47.560
Well, it was Auntie Clara's sister, I know what it was, and Auntie Clara lost her sight, so I used to take her and the rest of them, they had no children, wherever they wanted to go, I'd take them, it didn't embarrass me.

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:59.560
I mean, he used to like a drop of drink, Uncle Perth's did, and there was a club on Conwy Road in Newport, it was men only, right? Pioneer Club.

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:10.560
And he got that he couldn't go, because I used to take him on a Wednesday, pick him up on the way back home from market, he had a couple hours there with his mates, you know.

01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:13.560
But he got then he couldn't go.

01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:25.560
How am I going to manage, because you know women are allowed in, I was allowed to go in and pick him up, but you couldn't have a drink or anything, you know, but I never drank him alive.

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:33.560
So I'd go and pick him up on a Wednesday, Kathy said I don't think I'll be able to come much more, he said I'm getting feeble.

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:47.560
Well, alright then, I wonder could you pick it up for me, I said, but they might not serve me, you know, we'd better make sure they'll, I'll take your crate up and bring it back.

01:24:48.560 --> 01:25:04.560
So the following week he, I went in and Stuart, Stuart, aren't they in the club, he said, you're Kathy, aren't you? Yes, I said, he said, yeah, my wife says she knows you, because she's usually here on a Wednesday.

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:11.560
Oh, what trouble am I in now? Because I was allowed to go in and pick him up, look he'd be sat in a chair and all that.

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:22.560
No trouble at all, he said, but we're going to let you come in and pick his case up every week, you bring the empties and you can pay for it for him.

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:29.560
And then he said you can bring him up to the Christmas party, they'll allow you to stay with him if he wants.

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:38.560
Oh, I laughed, but you won't be allowed to drink in your mind, but you can stay with him, because his sight was going about you.

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:39.560
That is so funny, isn't it?

01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:53.560
And it was funny, and my mother was alive then and she said, the jobs you do, you're going to get into trouble one day, I said, you've got to help somebody when they're going blind.

01:25:53.560 --> 01:26:01.560
But then his wife went into hospital, now this was the funniest part, because we've got another farm up the road and they lived on the end, right?

01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:13.560
She had cancer, and she had to go in to have her breasts removed, and he'd only go in with me, right?

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:28.560
Well then, Auntie Clara was there a fortnight, and I thought, oh my God, he wouldn't allow it, I could go in the kitchen, I tidied that up, but I thought, oh I wonder what the bed is like, you know?

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:35.560
Because there was news now, she was coming home, I thought, oh my God, he'd been sleeping up there.

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:49.560
So I said to him, I said, Uncle Perth, I'm coming up tomorrow, alright, he said, do you know, I went up there the following day, I said, I'm going upstairs to strip your bed, I know it all is clean.

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:54.560
He said, oh you can't go upstairs, he said, people will talk about us.

01:26:54.560 --> 01:27:01.560
Now he was so deep-lied, I said, don't be so stupid.

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:10.560
He said, well he said, if you do, draw the curtains, so as nobody can see you upstairs.

01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:12.560
Oh my God.

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:26.560
Well I thought it was hilarious, so that night then, I went in, took him in to see Auntie Clara, she said, hope to be home on the weekend, I said, well I've been up and stripped all the beds and all that, I said, but you'll never guess.

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:29.560
Oh, what have you done?

01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:34.560
Well I said, he wouldn't let me go upstairs to start with, he said, because people would be talking.

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:43.560
But I said, he did then, allow me upstairs, but I had to draw the curtains so as nobody could see you, for they were going on the road, I was upstairs changing the bed.

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:46.560
Oh, just priceless, that's wonderful.

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:57.560
And we laughed over it, and always, you know, I mean, she finished up in her home, but every so often she'd say, I can never forget Perth being like that with you.

01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:05.560
Well, of course, I was only about 30 and he was about 70-odd, you know, it was so funny, I never dreamt of it.

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:13.560
I thought, go up and strip the beds and put them all clean and put the cleaner around, because she didn't have a hoover in those days, look.

01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:19.560
It was a pusher, well, or carry the mats downstairs and shake them and mop around.

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:25.560
It'd be lovely for her to come home, well, it'd be, you know, but he didn't mind me doing it downstairs, look.

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:28.560
He didn't like me upstairs.

01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:32.560
I think he was all on edge, that he wanted me to...

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:38.560
Well, I said, it's very traditional and worried about what people would say, they saw a woman up there, maybe...

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:45.560
Yeah, but I was always there, like downstairs, but, you know, I think...

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:54.560
I laughed, I couldn't believe it, I couldn't stop laughing, I thought, oh my God, would they think like that?

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:57.560
Well, you'd be amazed, wouldn't you really, sometimes?

01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:00.560
Yeah, but she was in hospital, they had no children or anything, you know.

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:04.560
Oh, he was having, he had a good job on the railway.

01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:06.560
What was he doing?

01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:09.560
He was over, oh, didcot.

01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:10.560
Yeah?

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:13.560
He was up a didcot, he had one of the boss's jobs up a didcot.

01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:14.560
Really?

01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:21.560
And she was a schoolteacher, Auntie Clara was, never had no children, they didn't, I don't know whether they could or didn't want to, I don't know.

01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:29.560
I don't suppose there are any diaries in your family or letters or receipts and that sort of thing, Kath, at all?

01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:32.560
It could be in the drawer upstairs.

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:34.560
In my junk room.

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:36.560
In my junk room?

01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:39.560
I just want to check, let me just check this.

01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:44.560
So, we've been talking for an hour and a half, should I turn it off now?

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:46.560
Yes, you better.

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.560
I mean, I'm always aware when I...
