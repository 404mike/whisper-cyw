00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280
Our next protocol is the stall. Once a man was lucky enough and he had trained, he would

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.000
have a stall of his own. The stall was part of what they called pillar and stall. The

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.680
man would take coal from the stall but leave a pillar. Usually a man's stall would be up

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:30.760
to 10 metres wide and the man would work that on his own or with a butty and get coal. When

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:39.960
the collier had got four foot of coal, that is four foot in by ten foot wide by four foot

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.240
high, he would then stop because he would have to support the area. Now he worked possibly four foot

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.400
of coal but he needed seven foot of room in his roadway so that the horse could get in with a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:00.240
drum to take away his coal. So his next move would be to drill and fire the top and you see in front

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:08.600
of you a hole in the top where the guy has made a start. You would drill a series of holes, you

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.960
would then fire it down to the floor and the stones then would be packed as you see them to the left

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:23.440
and right to support the roof in the waste area. Depending on how much coal he got would

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.920
decide his wages. The man would only be paid for the coal that he cut and he would only be paid

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.600
for the large coal that he cut. Small coal didn't count, small coal was shoved into the gob or the

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.240
waste area and he was only paid for the large. He was also expected to erect his own supports,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.280
he would be expected to lay his own rails.
