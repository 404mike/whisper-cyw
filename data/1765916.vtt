00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.880
Made it easier for me, yes.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.880
Made it easier for you because you're very independent.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.880
I am.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.880
Yeah.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.880
So, what did you think when you saw this newspaper cut in?

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.880
Really good.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.880
Yeah, were you proud?

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.880
I'm very pleased.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:21.880
So, it says here, Reanne thought of it because she worked at an old people's home.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:22.880
So, that was…

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.880
Care of people.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.880
Yeah, that was clue in tech.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.880
Take.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.880
Mm-hm.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.880
And were some of the old people finding it difficult to go to school?

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.880
Yes.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.880
No, I…

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.880
So, did you help them?

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.880
Yes, I have.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.880
Okay.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:46.880
So, who helped you a lot during this campaign?

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.880
Diane.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.880
Diane.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.880
She was…

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.880
Yeah.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.880
Who was Diane?

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.880
Diane was link worker.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:53.880
She was your link worker.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.880
As well.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.880
Okay.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.880
Can you remember how long ago this was?

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.880
Long time.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.880
It was a long time.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.880
Yeah.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.880
How long have you been coming to Lancashire?

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.880
Loaded.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.880
Loaded?

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.880
Yeah.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.880
Okay.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.880
So, what other things did you used to do?

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.880
Woodwork.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.880
You used to do woodwork?

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.880
Artcraft, painting, anything.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.880
What's your favourite thing?

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.880
Anything.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.880
Mosaics.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:20.880
You like doing mosaics?

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.880
Yeah.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.880
So, we're going to do some more of those, aren't we?

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.880
Yeah.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:26.880
Okay.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.880
And we haven't… you haven't been back to Mencap for a long time?

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.880
A long time, yes.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.880
Why is that?

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.880
Here.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.880
Why haven't we been open?

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.880
Shut.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.880
Why have we been shut?

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.880
Shut.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.880
What's been happening in the world?

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.880
That we couldn't open.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.880
Not at all.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.880
Yeah, what's happened?

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.880
Why have we got to wear masks?

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.880
Germs.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.880
Germs.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.880
So, we've been shut, haven't we, because of Covid?

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:03.880
Yes.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.880
Covid pandemic.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.880
Yeah.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.880
Yeah.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.880
And you can't wait to get back properly.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.880
Yeah, I agree.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.880
So, what things did we used to do?

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.880
Yes, wash the house.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.880
We did, before we shut down, we had to wash a house a lot, didn't we?

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:19.880
As well.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:20.880
But I'm thinking about Mencap now.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.880
Yes.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.880
What sort of things were we doing before we had to close?

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.880
We were… what did we used to do on a Monday?

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.880
Can you remember?

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.880
I love cooking with Rose.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.880
We like cooking with Rose.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.880
Yes.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:39.880
And do you… what do we… we've got anything at anywhere else we work.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:40.880
We've got the workshop.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.880
Hub.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:42.880
We've got the hub.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.880
Where else do we…

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.880
Cooking here.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.880
We do cooking here.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:46.880
Yeah.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.880
Yeah.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.880
Where do we grow vegetables?

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.880
Carrots, vegetables, anything.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.880
Where do we grow them, Rhian?

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.880
Rose gives me confidence.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.880
She does give you confidence.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.880
Yes.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.880
You like working with Rosie.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.880
Yeah.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.880
So, what did we used to do on Tuesdays?

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.880
I cleaned the rubbish.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:08.880
Did we used to walk up to the allotment?

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.880
Yeah.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.880
And what were we doing on Tuesdays?

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.880
We were doing the wash.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.880
Did we used to walk up to the allotment?

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.880
Yeah, garden, yeah.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.880
Yeah, so that's where we grew the…

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.880
Flowers, vegetables.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.880
That's right, yeah.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.880
So, we had the allotment.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.880
Yeah.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:28.880
We had the workshop.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.880
Yeah.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.880
We… well, we still got them and we still got the hub.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.880
Yes.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.880
What other things do we do in the community?

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.880
What did you use to enjoy doing?

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.880
We used to…

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.880
Which work?

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.880
We used to go and take things to people, didn't you, Juliet?

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.880
Yes.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.880
Do you remember what that was called?

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.880
Wheels on Wheels.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.880
Meals on Wheels, you used to do that.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.880
That's right.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.880
And what else do we do on a Thursday?

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.880
We make things in the workshop.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.880
Yeah, markets.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.880
Yeah.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.880
And we use to do a little bit of a…

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.880
You know, we used to go and do a little bit of a…

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.880
There's a little bit of a…

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.880
Yeah.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.880
We make things in the workshop.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.880
Yeah, markets.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.880
Yes, we go to the market.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.880
As well.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:10.880
Which bit is your favourite?

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.880
What thing is your favourite thing that we do?

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.880
The stall.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:14.880
You like the stall?

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.880
Yes.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.880
And what things did we make for our Christmas stall?

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.880
Table.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.880
Yeah.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.880
And what things did we sell for Christmas?

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.880
Can you remember?

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:24.880
That's me.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.880
You put… well, we had little trees, didn't we?

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.880
Yeah.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.880
And we made wooden…

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.880
Spoon.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.880
What does Santa… what Paul Santa's sleigh?

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.880
Erm…

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.880
Nick made one.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.880
Yeah.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.880
Reindeer, can you remember?

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.880
Oh, yes, I remember, yes.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:46.880
Yeah.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.880
So are you looking forward to coming back?

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:50.880
I can't wait.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.880
You can't wait, that's good.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.880
Is there anything else you would like to say about your… the Pelican crossing?

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.880
Yes.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.880
Is there anything else you want to say?

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:01.880
Really good.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.880
It's really good.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.880
It actually took a long, long time to get this done, didn't it?

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.880
Yeah.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.880
And they came and did a census…

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.880
Yes.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.880
…of the transport people.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.880
Yep.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.880
And they said that there wasn't enough traffic…

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.880
No.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.880
…initially to warrant a Pelican crossing.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:22.880
I agree.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:23.880
And then they came again.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.880
Then?

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:35.880
And your campaign eventually made them put three pedestrian crossings down.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.880
That was a start, yes.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:37.880
Yeah.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.880
And can you remember where the other… so there's one up by the high school now because of you…

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:43.880
Yes.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:44.880
…and the work you did.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.880
Can you remember what town the other two pedestrian crossings…

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:50.880
Talachyn.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.880
Talachyn.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:55.880
There's one in Talachyn and there are two in…

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:56.880
Clansanfryd.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.880
Yes.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.880
Yeah.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.880
So there are two there and one in Talachyn.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.880
And your campaign…

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.880
Yes.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.880
…helped people…

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.880
Yes.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.880
How?

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:08.880
Care for people.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.880
Yeah.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.880
You were caring about people.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.880
It was fun.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.880
So what can people do now safely?

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:15.880
They can…

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.880
Get a seat in a joint.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.880
They can cross the roads.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:18.880
Yeah.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.880
Yeah, I agree.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:20.880
You've done very well.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.880
You're going to say goodbye.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:22.880
Yes.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:23.880
Goodbye.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.880
Bye.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.880
Bye.
