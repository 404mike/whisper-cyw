00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
There's the old farmhouse there. They used to catch the rain water.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.960
There was a seston thing there where they caught the rain water.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.560
They had no electric or anything like that.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.560
Yep.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.400
And the field end running out, a small field there, that was their garden.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.800
Like self sufficiency.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.000
Some of the apple trees are still there to this day.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.240
And they yield quite well.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.600
And the soil there is black soil, different to the meadow itself, where it's more sandy.
