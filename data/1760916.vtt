WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
name Mark. Just at the top I'm just going to say I'm Marcia Armani the

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.240
interviewer with Gareth Davis with an I or an E? Of course.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:18.240
Is that the Welsh version? Well absolutely. And we're at Caleon and it is

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:27.280
Monday April 29 2019 and we're here to interview Dr. Mark Lewis. Mark so I'm

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.240
just going to pop that there. I wonder if you could just introduce yourself. Who

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.840
you are, what you do. Okay I'm Dr. Mark Lewis. I'm the senior curator of Roman

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.520
archaeology at the National Museum of Wales based at the National Roman

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.000
Legion Museum in Caleon. We hold all the Roman material from the two legionary

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.040
bases in Wales that happen to be very close together at Usk nearby and Caleon

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.520
where this museum is based. So we only hold Roman objects in our collections

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.640
and anything that's later any medieval material is sent off to the National

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.520
Museum in Cardiff because we are part of the National Museum of Wales but we hold

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.960
all the Roman material from those two legionary bases. There is a third Welsh

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.320
legionary base but it was built on the wrong side of the River Dee on the wrong

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.400
bank by the Romans so it's Chester and had it been on the other bank it would

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.960
be in Wales but it is our counterpart in the north if you like it's a very

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.440
similar geographical location at the lowest crossing point of the Dee and

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.640
took its name after the river Diva, Dewa, after the Dee and Isca, Caleon

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.480
Isca was named after the Usk. So we do have these mirror image fortresses at

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.160
either end of Wales but sadly as far as the National Museum is concerned the

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.720
great collections and great fortress of Chester just happened to be on

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.240
the wrong bank so they're in England in the modern boundary is along the river.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.200
So your interest in Roman, where does that come from?

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.840
Well I grew up on the edge of the levels in Caldecott and of course Caldecott is

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.200
adjacent to the great Roman city of Carwent, our tribal capital and I had a

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.080
fabulous inspirational history teacher when I went to Caldecott comprehensive

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.240
school who you will have met Peter Strong. He was my history teacher at the

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.060
age of 11 and on Sunday mornings he used to take the school minibus to an

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.520
excavation at Trostry near Usk and we used to dig and we were taught to dig

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:47.120
there from the age of 11, a group of us. Many of my contemporaries fell away as

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.920
time went by and as winters approached because we dug all the way through the

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.480
year at Trostry but he kept going, I kept going for three years and that took me

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.600
up to my teenage years when I was old enough to join the Roman excavations at

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.960
Carwent that were being undertaken by the National Museum of Wales and

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.120
directed by Richard Brewer the then keeper of Roman archaeology. So at the

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.160
age of 15 I joined the excavations in Carwent and because they happened during

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.200
the summer during school holidays I was able to continue to excavate there

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.240
through my GCSEs, through my A levels and even into when I was studying for my

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.280
degree for nine seasons in all. So that's where I got my love for Roman

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.040
archaeology and where I really sharpened my digging skills to become a

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.640
competent field archaeologist. What an inspirational teacher. Absolutely and I

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:51.480
think individuals, individual characters are absolutely critical. Somebody will

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.840
somewhere in their lives meet someone that that gives them that spark of

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.760
inspiration or then mentors them to develop it and Peter, I was very lucky I

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.240
had a number, there was also a local gentleman that used to come to that dig

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.280
from Rogget again on the edge of the levels called Barry Stopgate and he was

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.760
a very much a historian and archaeologist but interested in vernacular

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.600
architecture so farmhouses, old farmhouses and old farm buildings. So very

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:29.480
soon having Doug alongside Barry for years and years and years I was holding

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.360
the other end of his measuring tapes as we surveyed all the ancient farmhouses

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.240
the Tudor and Jacobean farmhouses on the levels and on the south of the county.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.560
The farmhouses in the north of the county had been surveyed by Lord Raglan

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.200
and Sir Cyril Fox of the National Museum in the early part of the 19th century

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.080
but they'd never come down to the south of Monmouthshire so we started picking

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.080
off a number of the houses. I joined Barry who'd been studying these houses

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.920
for some time so private individuals would give us access to their own

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.160
homes and we'd measure them, survey them accurately, look at the internal features

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:17.320
like ancient fireplaces, staircases, plaster ceilings in some cases, paneled

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:23.520
Tudor paneled passageways etc and we would photograph them, measure them and

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.560
then write them up and many of those reports are deposited in the local

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.120
library service. So these characters are inspirational and one thing leads

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.920
to another and without them and the inspiration from my own father used to

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:44.320
take me to all these places and give me access and do much especially on the

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.760
landscape side of things in understanding how things fit together in a landscape

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:58.160
context. Well when I went to university one of the things we were taught very

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.440
early on was a new sort of theory in archaeology that was called a

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:08.800
phenomenology of landscape and it was the way that people move about in

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.760
landscapes and then start to attach meaning or importance to certain

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.960
features within landscapes. Perhaps they mark passageways between the summer

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.640
grazing or the winter grazing, perhaps they mark out territory where people lay

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:32.120
claim to grazing rights through the positions of their chambered tombs, the

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.720
early farmers, the first monuments within our landscape that we can still see

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:46.600
today. So people started to place monuments, their burial mounds with

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.840
respect to certain views from them so that they could look down on their

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.160
former territory and life from the grave etc. So there's a relationship

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.760
between the archaeology, the monuments and where they're positioned within the

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.960
landscape perhaps with respect to ancient communication routes, the road

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:12.000
system etc. And my father had always intuitively been very very knowledgeable

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.800
and thoroughly understood that aspect of landscape and so when I went to

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.240
university and they taught this as really quite modern theory that had only

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:29.360
been published about the time I was at university I was immediately overjoyed

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.800
that I thoroughly understood this because this is the way I'd been trained

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.520
but I was immediately depressed that I hadn't published it first because I fully

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:43.360
understood this new theory because this is the way I viewed archaeology and had

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:51.560
been raised to view it. And so it's a number of factors that have brought

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:59.560
me along the path that I now tread but those early mentors and that

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.760
early inspiration was key to really getting me going on the journey.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.760
Feel free to ask questions Gareth.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:16.160
Thank you, yes I will. It's just interesting that you've drawn the archaeology and

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:22.920
geomorphology really together. How do you see that fitting in possibly when we look

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.920
at the landscape on the levels?

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:31.520
I think, and for me it's the way I think that we can best understand the interaction

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:39.440
between man and our landscape or that particular landscape in the past but the

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:47.360
importance that I place on the levels is not wholly historical. It's the fact that

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.120
it can inform our futures globally actually not just locally. I think if we

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:57.800
take the lessons and our understandings of the pasts on the levels at different

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:02.800
points in time and we project them forward in the knowledge that the

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:10.040
current predictions are for continued global sea level rise, temperature rise

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:16.480
and the commensurate sea level rise that will come with that on a global

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:21.120
basis then we can look at the way the levels have been affected by sea level

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:32.320
rise, the coming and going of the high mean water spring tide over time and

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:38.080
project what that will mean for people on the levels and elsewhere in the

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.720
future because people in the past have had the ability to move in and out of

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:48.360
this landscape. In the Iron Age and before the Neolithic farmers, the Iron

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.400
Age farmers even as far back as the Mesolithic, the Middle Stone Age, people

00:09:53.400 --> 00:10:01.400
moved in and out of the tidal zone if you like and the flood plains of

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:07.840
the levels. It would be very much a summer grazing area for pastoral farming.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:13.600
Very little if any arable, no evidence really for arable, very very localized

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.240
probably places like the higher ground like Goldcliff Island and otherwise on

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:24.920
the Fen Edge and this is shown again in a landscape sense by the positions of

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:29.640
the early Norman churches. If you look at the earliest churches in southern

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:34.600
Monmouthshire they sit along the Fen Edge right on the edge where the level meets

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:40.360
the rising ground up off the flood plain so you start off with places like

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:48.000
St. Pierre, Mathen, you move along then Port Scuett right on the edge where

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.760
the ground starts to rise up off the flood plain. Caldecott again securely

00:10:54.760 --> 00:11:01.680
just up off the water meadows where the castle sits and then you travel along

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:08.320
to the two rogues again on the very edge. Undie again right on the edge so

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.960
close to the railway line which again was then placed right at the edge on the

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:17.960
slightly higher rising ground and of course the M4 is even further inland

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:25.200
but again hugs that higher ground. So people move from the winter grazing on

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:31.960
the higher land, the less boggy areas down to this very very fertile rich flood

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:39.160
plain the levels for summer grazing. So you've got this transhumance as

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:44.000
it's called the movement of livestock and people in and out of the landscape.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:51.720
If it floods you move out, if it is dry then you can utilize it

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:58.560
for grazing. Well the issues we have with the intensification of land use and with

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:03.520
population rises that people don't really want to move in and out of areas

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:08.640
anymore and they economically they're not able to do so. We're quite sedentary,

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.840
we're quite fixed within landscapes and the problem that we have is that the

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.680
landscape of the levels is pretty much fossilized at its ancient levels, Roman

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:23.600
ground level covered by about half a meter of later clay inundation from

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:29.400
inundations later on and very little since the land is at a certain level but

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.480
the sea has continued to rise very slowly since the end of the last ice

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:40.520
age and the current concerns with regard to global warming are that it

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:47.200
seems to be rising more quickly now since the industrial age, the dawn of

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:53.360
the industrial age then if the land stays at the same level but sea level

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.640
and high tides are rising higher and higher you become more and more reliant

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:02.600
upon sea defenses until you can't rely on them anymore because eventually it

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:10.000
might catch up with them. If you have a failure of a low sea defense it's not

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.680
that catastrophic usually the water will flood in it will flow back out again

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:20.000
but if you build astronomically high sea defenses and there's a there's a failure

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.880
of the sea defense then it can be quite catastrophic because then you start to

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:30.600
get more tsunami like waves that sweep across the landscape so the idea of just

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:35.800
raising sea walls ever higher is probably not the way to approach any

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.880
future sea level rise so I think if we take lessons from the past and look at

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.360
when the levels were first defended when they were first first attempts at

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:50.160
drainage were made on a large scale to improve the land and then to defend it

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:55.020
from the sea we can start to look at what the futures may be for different

00:13:55.020 --> 00:14:01.460
areas of the levels if the current trend for sea level rise continues.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:12.420
Do you remember the very first piece of what first seen you uncovered as a youngster in an archaeological table?

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:18.300
Well trust you we were very lucky it was a medieval manor house and we were

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.860
just we were in the ditch around it so that's where they just threw all

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:26.980
their refuse all their rubbish so huge amounts of wonderful pottery quite late

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.900
actually 17th century we do haven't got down to the medieval layers and so

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:38.580
beautiful glazes beautiful roulette patterns on these pots so it was quite

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:45.500
beautiful material that helps it wasn't just boring old grey broken potsherds so

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:53.980
yeah I think my first ever finds were were actually were the 17th 18th century

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.380
pottery in abundance at Trostrie.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.380
But what did that feel like and were you aware then of the age?

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:08.380
Yeah it felt like an immediate sort of one step removed contact with the past

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:13.860
because the hand that dropped it in there it hadn't moved until the hand

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:18.820
removed it so you do feel that you're the first person to have handled

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:24.100
something since it was last handled then you wonder how it was deposited who

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:28.580
went through the process of depositing it and what their thoughts may have been

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.260
probably thoughtlessly just just getting rid of as much rubbish as they can into

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:39.780
the ditch they had their own cares and worries and then probably diseases so it

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:49.820
opens up a whole world of possibilities as to what the back story for that tiny

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:53.940
little pot should might have been how was it broken in the first place and

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:57.980
where on earth is the rest of it because it's so common that you'll find one

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:02.740
piece of a pot if I break something in the kitchen I sweep it all up and I

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:07.580
deposit it together but somehow over time things often don't find their way

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:12.620
into the ground as parts of the whole deposited together often you just find

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:16.540
one part and just make you wonder what happened to the rest of it hasn't turned

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:23.340
to dust so it's all out there somewhere it's just there waiting to be found

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:32.100
I often think when I pass an old stone wall that's hidden in off the track that

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:36.300
who who made that wall where what were their lives like it's lovely to hear you

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:42.220
describe that what about your first piece of Roman wear that will certainly

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:50.220
have been at car went I was quite early on my first couple of years there we

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:56.780
had wonderful concrete floors within the Basilica the town hall car went to the

00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:07.100
the the the the Civic Center if you like for this this tribal area and these

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:10.900
wonderful concrete floors needed cleaning so I've sat about traveling

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.060
down onto these wonderful floors now they didn't need these particular

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:18.100
floors I was on were offices they didn't have mosaics on the floor they didn't

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:23.020
have these beautiful quarter round corner moldings rather like a skirting

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:28.580
board around the edge I remember that very distinctly I remember finding my

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:34.820
first my first coins there at car went but my most important discovery there

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:40.820
was not actually an object at all it was a hole in the ground a circular hole in

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:46.260
the ground in the middle of the Basilica so between the two colonnades of what

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:51.300
would have looked like a modern Cathedral really with two aisles and a

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.580
knave down the middle it would have stood at least 15 meters high very very

00:17:55.580 --> 00:18:03.620
tall building a huge I'll haul and in the middle in the foundation levels the

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:13.180
the the natural soil was a hole with an X shaped slot that settled or being cut

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:18.340
down into the clay and I just dug what was there and that's what it produced a

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:23.780
hole like a with an X a big X in the ground I didn't know what it was but the

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:27.580
director knew immediately what it was because one had been found at London and

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:34.180
it was the impression in the soil that had been left by the crane that the

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:40.180
Romans had used to raise the column drums on top to build the colonnade so

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:46.600
because he knew now where the crane sat in the middle to do the two columns on

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:52.080
either side he knew where the columns were as they'd gone and because he knew

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.440
the spacing from the end wall of where that those columns were because of the

00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:01.520
position of the crane he could tell where the columns were how many they were

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:06.640
how equally spaced they were and because of the way Roman

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.160
architecture works he could then calculate the height of the building so

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:15.280
it became apparent to me very early on it's not a treasure hunt for the staff

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.720
it's about the information that we can gain through this process so my best

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:27.120
discovery in many ways or certainly one of the best was was not an object at all

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:32.440
it was just a shape in the soil in the ground a slightly different colored soil

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:37.440
with a slightly different texture that we were able to follow the shape of and

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:42.800
it gave us the indentation in the ground where a Roman crane has been

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:48.920
set up maybe only for a day or two but it that that impression was sealed

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:57.000
beneath the floors of the Basilica and has survived for 1850 years to be

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.520
rediscovered so again is that there's that connection with an event that was

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:06.080
never monumentalized it was never set up like some grand monument to be admired

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:12.520
by future generations it's just a passing moment in time that just happened

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:17.800
to get fossilized in the soil imprint and gave us information that we could

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:23.960
release from the ground over nearly 2,000 years later

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:34.600
you've also got a passion for the Roman period that's obvious but where do you

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:41.800
see and how do you see the Roman footprint in the levels particularly?

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:47.840
well I like to look either side and to contextualize it because it was Sir

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:52.320
Augustine that said that the world is like a book and those that don't travel

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:59.320
only read one page now that's true if you don't travel geographically but

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:03.520
it's true if you don't travel in time so if I only studied the Roman period I

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.480
probably wouldn't understand it at all because they stand on the shoulders of

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:13.120
every previous generation and then there are memories of how things were in the

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.520
Roman period that shape all future generations including today because

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:20.840
we're still using their alphabet and Latin is hugely important in Welsh and

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:31.080
English so on the levels we've got evidence that Roman sea level was much

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:37.640
lower than it is today nearly 1.8 meters lower on any one given tide will

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:43.460
be like for like about one and three quarter meters lower that's because as

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:51.000
we've come out of the last ice age sea level has slowed down it's rising over

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.920
time but it's still rising ever so slightly and there are other sorts of

00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:00.640
geological impacts in Britain such as isostatic rebound and the fact that the

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.640
east of Britain is slightly tipping in the West rising up ever so slightly but

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:10.840
nonetheless in the Severnestuary and here at Cullien we're about 1.7 meters

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:16.240
higher at any high tide today than it will have been in the past so if you

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:23.000
take off that 1.7 meters across the levels actually most tides would never

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.080
have flooded and you would need a sea wall on the levels so we start to

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:33.120
question how old the sea defenses are likely to be and to have been but what

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:38.880
we can find when we dig down on the levels is that all Roman land surfaces

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:45.540
are covered by later inundations which left around half a meter or so to a

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:53.960
meter of the gray heavy alluvium the gray clay from the estuary that you can

00:22:53.960 --> 00:23:02.080
see beneath the sea wall anywhere where there's no seagrass growing and once

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:07.600
you get below that half a meter or so you get to the old Roman land surfaces

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:12.560
but you don't get that many field systems there are localized field

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:17.760
systems around Nash water treatment works at Goldcliff and they tend to have

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:23.920
been formed where the Romans cut ditches and when you cut a ditch you get

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:30.040
a bank that goes with it and they form little enclosures or fields but the

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.960
banks aren't serious attempts at sea walls they might protect from the odd

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:39.840
couple of feet inundation but then they're not they're not a continuous sea

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:46.000
wall as we would understand it so the focus for them was probably to just

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:53.040
improve the grazing by draining or speeding drainage into the adjacent

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:58.600
ditches and to take the water away and they appear to have been involved in

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.280
some serious engineering works because one of the most important Roman finds

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:09.400
from the grant levels was found off Goldcliff Point at Goldcliff Pill on the

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:19.840
edge of the pill and it's a lius limestone flat slab about two to three

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:26.360
feet in height and it's inscribed in Latin probably in the second or third

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:38.200
centuries AD and it says the century of Statorius Maximus of the first cohort so

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:45.360
from this legion at Caillean the second Augustine legion the soldiers of the

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:51.760
century under the century in Statorius Maximus constructed thirty three and a

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:57.320
half paces of something that's all it says the interesting thing about the

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:05.440
stone is it's a very thin slab and the bottom half has not been inscribed so it

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.280
the bottom half would have been set in the ground and it would have stood like a

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:15.680
little headstone on the probably an earthwork that had been constructed now

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:22.160
that stone is intriguing because it shows that the Roman army is involved in

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:28.240
an engineering work of some kind construction work at Goldcliff on the

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:35.040
levels the stone was found in the estuary and clay beyond the present sea

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:40.800
war but we know that the sea had taken huge tracts of land even within recent

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:45.680
centuries at Goldcliff so it would have been on land probably when it when it

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.680
when it was set up and it's now just beyond the current sea wall which again

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:56.560
tells us something about land loss or gain in the estuary over time and the

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.960
fact that they're building thirty three and a half paces is intriguing because

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:03.760
the first cohort has double strength century so you could have anything from

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:08.440
the usual 80 men in the century up to 160 just building thirty three and a

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:12.080
half pay or constructing or digging thirty three and a half paces of

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:17.960
something that's not very long actually for 80 to 160 men to be working on just

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:22.560
thirty three and a half paces it then makes us think that because they've

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:27.920
divvied it up in thirty three and a half paces the likelihood is that it's one

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:33.640
third of something that's a hundred paces because they tend to think in

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:39.560
centuries and that sort of way of thinking so now you you're talking

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:47.200
anything up to sort of 300 odd men working on just a hundred paces of

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:55.160
somethings could be quite an important engineering work of some kind and we

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:58.880
have no sense of what this could be other than the fact that Goldcliff

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:04.800
pill merrily flows by it and the evidence from Martin Bell's work at

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:09.400
Goldcliff on the Iron Age site suggests that there was no Goldcliff pill there

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:15.680
in the Iron Age so the proximity of this stone to the Goldcliff pill the huge

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:20.720
quite significant water course that now flows out into the estuary at that point

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:25.440
might suggest that it's actually a Roman construction that they actually

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:32.840
constructed Goldcliff pill itself as a drainage ditch to drain a large part of

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:40.560
the levels to improve the grazing either for their cattle for their

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:48.480
livestock or that they were set to work down there because this was the legion

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:53.600
that helped to build Hadrian's Wall this was the legion although this was their

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:58.560
base they many of them many cohorts were sent up to the north they also built the

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:06.160
Antonine Wall with other legionary cohorts from other legions so when

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:11.840
they're not up there constructing engineering works like Hadrian's Wall or

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:17.320
the Antonine Wall a what you do with them to stop them causing trouble and

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:23.920
B how do you keep them trained and ready for that type of engineering work if

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:28.040
they've got nothing else to do and perhaps I just wonder whether they were

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:34.240
sent to the levels not through necessity necessarily but to train them and to

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:40.480
keep them occupied whilst they're back at base here at Cullion and they

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:48.400
can be usefully employed in work that can benefit the legion and the local

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:54.680
kivitas the local city state that's entered at Clowend and I suspect that's

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:59.200
what they're doing and so when we see those little field systems or

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:05.880
enclosures or drainage ditches at Nash when we see them at Goldcliff when we

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:10.560
see the the pill and the evidence from the Goldcliff stone these seem to be

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:18.640
the first attempts at not necessarily reclaiming the levels from the sea but

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:24.640
enhancing their grazing potential for more of the the the annual cycle for

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:29.520
more more of the more of the year so I think it's when it's the Roman period

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:33.640
when we start to see if you like intensification a serious attempt to

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:40.040
harness the levels for more of the year rather than the old system of moving

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:45.940
with the seasons in and out of the levels from the Fenedge down onto the

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:54.000
rich grazing of the Fagmites Reeds and the the the the very marshy area that it

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.400
would have been prior to the Roman enhancements.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:02.760
Anecdotally, do you talk to people on the levels and they'll say oh the rene

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:11.680
system is all Roman? No the existing rene system is largely set in the alluvium

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:17.480
that is post-roman we know that that seals the Roman landscape underneath.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:24.200
The two big questions are there are some major waterways the White Wall,

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:29.640
the Black Wall that come down and the Monk's Ditch and the question at the

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:34.880
moment is just how old are they? We know that the monasteries maintained them

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:41.240
certainly, hence the names, but it is very very possible that they have Roman

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:48.060
origins and we just don't know for certain yet because we don't have the

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:56.280
date in evidence to prove whether their origins lie in the Roman period but the

00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:06.320
Romans certainly begin the process that either created them or led to led

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.760
sequentially to their creation. My suspicion is that the Romans were

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:18.360
involved in some way in the proto White Wall, Black Wall and Eve and others

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:25.640
probably in between in that we start to see environmental changes that can be

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:34.880
explained in the Roman period and later Roman period by land improvement if you

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:39.800
like. So we've seen that with the Goldcliffe stone so it's just the extent

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:48.880
of it and which particular parts of it but then that system is then it becomes

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:54.720
those particular renes, those primary arteries if you like within the

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:59.040
system. In the early medieval period just after the Roman period they start

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:04.200
to become really important boundaries between land holdings so it suggests

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:09.600
they have antiquity that they go back a long way in time. So the

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:16.040
suspicion is yes at the moment that the major renes might have had Roman

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:20.600
origins but not necessarily in exactly the same form that they are today but

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:27.920
those will have been either maintained or reconstructed in their sort of

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:36.720
more modern formats by later ages. Certainly the monastic holdings had an

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:41.600
important part to play in that hence Monk's Ditch because any lands that they

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:46.560
could reclaim from the sea they could keep so there was a huge benefit as a

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:51.080
land grab on if you like if you can if you can defend land from the sea it's

00:32:51.080 --> 00:33:02.040
yours so it's the local lords of manners had an interest in doing what they

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:06.840
could to improve their lands as best they could and reclaim as many

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:10.520
permanently from the sea as they possibly could. By medieval times

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:14.400
obviously sea level has risen and then you start to need to defend then so you

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:19.960
get the wall being built and it's not understood. Maiga means wall, Magwa

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:24.280
means wall and it's not fully understood whether that relates to just some old

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:28.600
archaeological walls of a Roman villa somewhere or whether it actually refers

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:32.920
to white wall or whether it might actually refer to the sea wall itself

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:37.440
because it actually stops at Maiga and Deerogget and Caldecott weren't

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:42.360
defended they were not held by the monasteries and defense from the sea

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:48.520
certainly on the Caldecott moor and in Rogget actually came very very late in

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:56.480
the 19th century whereas Maiga and along to Goldcliff you can see it from the

00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:01.880
12th century so you know there's a huge difference in different places and one

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:07.240
of the the wonderful places on the levels is Moorgate in Undy because it's

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:12.360
a medieval house it doesn't look like it from the road but it is inside it's

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:22.040
medieval or at least Tudor, late medieval on the inside and the name of it it

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:28.360
sums up its geographical location it was the Moorgate because that was the

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:36.720
start of the moor on the undefended levels once you get beyond Maiga so the

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:42.000
place names are memories in often of what was once there.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.160
Reidwick, the Redwick, the dairy farm in the reeds reminds us it was mainly

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:56.400
pastoral, dairy farm is cattle is not arable down there and then we move along

00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:01.920
and you've got where I grew up Caldecott which is a very interesting

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:09.200
Anglo-Saxon place name uncommon in Wales because the part of Wales where

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:13.120
Caldecott lies on the Gwent level was anglicized very very early on because it

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:17.880
yo-yoed before the Norman conquest between the Welsh and Harold Godwinson

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:21.880
held it for a little while and had his hunting lodge at Portscrew it very very

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:28.560
briefly or was constructing one before it was destroyed by the Welsh and

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:33.600
Caldecott is actually an Anglo-Saxon name and there were about 120 Caldecott's in

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:39.160
England and they center on the Kingdom of Mercia the pre-Norman Kingdom of

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:49.240
Mercia and it's thought that there is a link with that place name and a court or

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:57.960
Witan that was held at Exeter in the early 900s where the Anglo-Saxon earls

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:02.040
were very concerned that they were executing too many people for

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:09.880
committing theft and especially too many teenage boys and so they wanted to

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:21.420
commute the death sentence to or cutting off hands etc to banishment so they seem

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:27.360
to have set up places that were away from the rest of society away from Roman

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:33.480
roads they're commonly on wasteland that aren't isn't otherwise useful isn't

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:40.120
otherwise fertile for arable farming and they're at the edges of Shires

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:44.120
normally they seem to congregate at Shire edges and it's been argued I think

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:48.840
quite convincingly that these Caldecott's can be interpreted as as cold

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:58.120
shelters cold means cold and shelter cot cotter shelter that that we're in the

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:03.300
sense of cold shoulder rather than not just not heated because they these

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:08.080
places may actually been the places of banishment where people were allowed to

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:13.920
squat if they were pushed out of society and Caldecott's in a similar location

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:22.040
it's got its back to the the more the level it's away from the other main

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:27.120
centers Port Scuett and Covent at that time it's not near the Roman Road

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:33.920
Network not very close to it and so it's sufficiently distant and for most

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:39.360
periods you don't want to be actually on the coast because of piracy it's quite a

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:45.360
dangerous place to be so early ports such as Bristol Newport they're a little

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:49.760
way up river Kyleon they're not actually on the mouth of the river they're a

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:55.560
little way up river Cardiff little way up river more so than it needs to be

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:59.720
you sheltered from the sea and just out in the mouth but they they come up with

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:05.720
the river so that you're not too close and and too easy of access for people

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:11.280
that might be planning maritime smash and grab raids so again another place

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:15.440
name that suggests from the early period what the landscape might have been like

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:20.160
it's the place that other people don't want to necessarily be at some perhaps a

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:26.600
place that's still marginal a place that's still accessed only perhaps

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:33.920
seasonally and for the summer grazing and not for arable in the way that in

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:38.080
the way that that the fan edge would be

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.080
Have you done that?

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:57.080
Well I was just interested in the link between Latin and Welsh and the way that you described the fact that the Welsh language or Celtic language whatever it was has retreated in that area fairly early on.

00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:06.760
I think it's quite significant because in Welsh particularly Welsh place names, eddow,

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:13.240
farm names and so on describe very closely geographical features and so so

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:18.760
forth yeah there doesn't seem to be that much evidence then in the levels of

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:24.980
oh no there is I've concentrated so far on the Caldecott level and I've

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:31.740
concentrated in the two case studies are on to the east Redwick and Caldecott

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:35.700
to the east in the Anglicised part of the Caldecott level to the east of the

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:42.260
Monks ditch now as you get to Nash and Goldcliff you see a completely

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:48.780
different field system that was pointed out by Stephen Rippon at Exeter and you

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:56.020
start to get Welsh place names at land holdings that look like the Welsh system

00:39:56.020 --> 00:40:02.180
where inheritance was split equally between the areas etc and where the

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:06.820
the land at the fields are not grouped together necessarily as whole farms but

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:10.940
spread around a little bit more and a bit more higgledy-piggledy if you like

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:20.300
now in the east area so the Mathen level and Roggetmore and along to

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:25.580
Magor that were early Norman plantations if you like and it's thought that

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:36.580
Whitsun was probably a Norman land claim for example you you get English

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:42.860
descriptions of the landscape so you get summer lees the summer pastures the

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:49.900
summer meadows lees and the Lee and so the summer lease or even summertime in

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:54.460
Newport the summer grazing again so again pastoral again it's cattle on the

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:59.260
whole sheep as well but mainly cattle I should say I keep harking back to cattle

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:04.820
because when you look at the artwork from the Iron Age Roman boundary they're

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:10.260
fixated on cattle they love their escutcheons and mounts that are ox heads

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:15.740
and that sort of thing so I get a very strong sense that wealth may have been

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:21.580
considered in terms of your your cattle holding at the time you know we might

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:26.780
look at somebody's car or even the motor what version of a mobile phone they

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:31.520
might be brandishing I think at that time in this part of the world you might

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:39.160
have been judged on your cattle basically you're the size of your ranching

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:43.160
and we are talking ranching we're not looking at fields here with hedgerows

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:48.640
that comes later on it is a sort of herding proper ranching in the sort of

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:54.880
American sense so on the whole but then you need enclosures to bring them in so

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:58.800
there are sort of enclosures that are created what we would see as fields but

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:03.880
not the whole landscape there are fields that just planted groups of

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.520
fields planted here and there within the landscape rather than a whole

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:11.740
landscape fields once you get to the other side of monk stitching start to

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:17.220
change and your summer leases and your your your summer grazing start to become

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:26.320
Mardis which again one of the senses in Welsh of a Mardie is is the summer

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:34.200
grazing and names like tremor first so you've got these these settlements that

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:38.680
again are down on the fence but but they're they're they're named in Welsh

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:47.280
so this naming seems to have solidified around you know around the time of the

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:51.440
coming of the norm and some of the names stick from pre-norman times some of them

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:56.320
are new depending on the land holdings but they the main difference that gives

00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:00.560
us this boundary about along the line of the monk stitch really it starts to

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:06.200
solidify around the time of the coming of the Normans so whatever you were

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:14.280
calling it by then seems to have largely stuck but it gives us again that that

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:21.440
not deliberate but this this this circumstantial fossilization of a

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:27.160
moment in time where you can see a boundary where the anglicized influence

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:32.040
has come and this is Anglo-Norman but again it's the the the Anglo-Norman

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:36.960
influence has got so far with land holdings and indeed the doomsday

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:43.040
holdings in this part of the world that that mention who holds what land as far

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:48.840
as Carleion were very very fortunate that the Caldecott level was included in

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:53.480
doomsday is the most westerly entry within it the rest of Wales wasn't

00:43:53.480 --> 00:44:00.280
Norman so isn't in doomsday they speak of the hardwicks and we've got hardwick

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:04.160
at chapstone and elsewhere still in the place names hardwicks are dairy farms

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:10.840
again so it's very very very clear what's going on here

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:15.480
Caldecott's got plows by then because it's mentioned they're all taxed

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:21.520
because the Norman view of the feudal system was that all land in Britain has

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:26.120
one landowner it's the king and it's doomsday and this is his terrier of his

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:32.040
tenants so even the lords and the you know the the the sheriffs everybody

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:36.920
beneath him they're all tenants of the king so although we'd look up to them as

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:43.120
the top of the the top branches of the tree they're not they still they're

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:49.040
still tenants of the king and he's got this list now of what's owed to him by

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:55.480
his tenants for for that those lands their mills their fisheries etc their

00:44:55.480 --> 00:45:01.240
plows how many people they're working on those farms on the hardwicks etc and

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:06.400
then whatever profit they can make over and above that is obviously theirs

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:13.280
but it's very clear from those early documents how the landscape certainly

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:21.280
in the east is starting to shape up as a more intensively managed landscape but

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:24.840
still along the lines of that time of what it probably was in the Roman

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:31.080
period and beyond they just had in more and more land improvement mechanisms

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:36.800
through drainage and then eventually through to sea defense to to the mix to

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:43.120
further defend the land problem is that the land behind is now fossilized behind

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:50.400
those medieval sea walls but the sea is still rising behind it and of course many

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:56.800
of our great cities were and urban conurbations were trading ports and ports

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:03.040
by definition at sea level but many of them have early foundation dates in the

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:09.600
Roman period like Cullian or in medieval times like Newport Cardiff and Roman

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:17.360
Cardiff and Roman Carmarthens etc but where development was at the medieval

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:23.960
or Roman high tide mark and high and dry it wouldn't necessarily be today

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:29.840
because of sea level rise so there are lessons I think to be learned for future

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:34.800
generations in terms of how we manage our responses to climate change and

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:40.640
environmental change and for the levels perhaps that informs us in terms of the

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:44.640
fact that the only response really in the past was to move in and out of those

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:50.040
areas so like a canoe we're going to find out that just standing there and

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:55.520
commanding the sea to behave is not going to work and it might be necessary

00:46:55.520 --> 00:47:04.800
to work out a rationale and a methodology for allowing the sea to take

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:09.960
any land that it requires and to be able to move in and out of the landscape as

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:17.320
change continues because the one norm is change people tend to shy away from it

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:23.680
but the one fact archaeologically and environmentally is change so we need to

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:28.040
learn the lessons from the past to inform the future

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:35.040
Talking about the estuary, I've spoken to a few people who have been out there and follow the tide date

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:40.240
black rock fishery for example they're always finding clay pipes and musket balls etc

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:46.360
and could you tell us about your fishing basket find

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:49.400
the context around that and any other work you've done on it?

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:56.960
yeah I was a student in conservation at Cardiff University in the early 90s and

00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:08.160
we had to go to a museum for eight weeks each summer to gain on the job

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:18.160
vocational experience as an internship and because of my great interest in the

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:24.240
geographical area around Newport and the levels I chose one placement at Newport

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:31.280
Museum and Art Gallery working under the great Kate Hunter there the head

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:40.040
conservator at the time and during my internship Nigel Nailing from the

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:48.680
University of Lampeter was working out on the mega level beyond the sea wall

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:55.280
surveying mainly surveying fish traps etc that had been first discovered and

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:59.320
highlighted in the studies that had been undertaken in advance of the

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:02.880
construction of the second seven crossings so they looked at environmental

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:08.080
impact before its construction and archaeological impact if it was going to

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:14.240
destroy archaeology along its path then they were able to record it before

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:18.800
destruction or remove it they looked either side as well because the

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:24.160
construction process could start to change the way the estuary maybe swirled

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:31.400
around and you know scoured or what have you and a fish trap was noted at

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:38.080
mega that had been half sectioned by the tide naturally by the tide which

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:42.600
enabled the insides to be seen where you've got a kind of non return valve a

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:50.680
cone shaped internal wicker structure that prevents the fish can swim down

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:56.400
into the trap but they find it hard to get past the funnel back out again and

00:49:56.400 --> 00:50:00.440
because this had been half sectioned naturally by the tide it was a

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:04.680
beautiful example that could be used for teaching of how these things actually

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:09.240
work because when you recreate them you can't see the insides because it's a

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:17.960
round wicker basket so it was being destroyed by the tide which was scouring

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.640
it away so it made a perfect project for an undergraduate student because if we

00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:28.880
were successful in lifting it Newport Museum would get a 12th or 13th century

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:35.200
original fishing trap from the estuary that would be an excellent display and

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:41.120
teaching resource but if we failed it was going to be destroyed by the sea

00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:46.120
anyway so it wasn't really a major part of the project and there were no funds

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:52.480
available as usual story but we had some old casting bandage that's used for

00:50:52.480 --> 00:51:00.560
broken arms or broken legs and the sell by date had long gone so again if it was

00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:04.960
kind of I think it was a polyurethane that reacted on contact with moist air

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:09.280
ideal for the levels so if it hadn't gone off we're going to use up this

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:13.360
stuff it was a free fish trap if we could get it out so I was sent out there

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:19.120
with a mud sled and given some help and we excavated around the thing we found

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:25.760
the stake which was lifted with it that originally been used to tether it to

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:32.960
hold it in in the estuarine mud and it and its stake were excavated around to

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:37.400
leave them on a pedestal and that's all we could achieve in the first tide

00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:45.760
because that part of the level it's very very shallow inclined from the

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:51.640
fan edge down from the sea wall down onto the gravels beyond the mud but the

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:57.120
mud is very thick it's about two feet thick and so the tide comes in quicker

00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:01.920
there at mega then it's possible for a man to run on land not alone get across

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:06.120
that mud so if you get trapped by the tide that's it out there you can't get

00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:10.600
back so we had a very small window of opportunity to excavate so we just dug

00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:19.440
around it the first time I placed my trowel down by the side of the

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:26.240
excavated trap and bandaged the thing round to protect it and then went to get

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:29.400
my trowel and it just gone and I thought well that's easy I put it by there I'll

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:33.240
just fish around in the mud this slurry that's out there see if you can find it

00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:37.920
couldn't feel it anywhere that never did find it so I had to abandon the

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:42.640
trowel and most archaeologists become attached to their trowel because you

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:47.400
that was the trowel that dug this or found that and found the funny feature at

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:52.600
Coend so I'd lost this trowel and then we returned the next day after the tide

00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:57.320
had gone in gone out and it was low tide again and Lomiel sat on the surface

00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:01.480
proud about 12 feet away probably washed up the estuary and back down again was my

00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:08.640
trowel bright orange because the iron had turned to iron chloride big crystals

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:16.880
of iron chloride on this work hard and steel trowel and we then dug underneath

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:22.440
the fish trap slid it up onto a mud sled and it was taken in a minibus off to

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:28.040
Newport Museum where it slowly was allowed to dry out and then a future

00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:33.840
Cardiff intern after my time with Kate excavated down to the fish trap and

00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:38.160
dried it out and stabilized it for display and it's still displayed now in

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:43.320
the gallery with a photograph of it in situ the underside that you can't see in

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:49.120
the case with the half section fish trap with the sort of non return valve and

00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:54.960
it's still displayed in the bandage that we used to actually lift it that actually

00:53:54.960 --> 00:54:00.240
shows the lifting process and it's resting on the estuarine mud that filled

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:03.800
it when it was in the estuary all preserved this was a little bit of the

00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:09.000
seven estuary that's been lifted for display in in Newport Museum and it's

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:16.040
quite a rare example of a of a fish trap of that date the trowel then I put away

00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:20.320
and forgot about because it could really be used very well anymore and gone very

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:27.480
orange and when I last saw it a few years later it had just completely turned

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:37.080
to orange powder a solid steel forged trowel had just completely corroded away

00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:42.560
and turned to orange powder because of the the aggressive nature of the chlorine

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:48.080
in the seawater that just destroys ironwork so it just shows how aggressive

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:52.880
the environment can be for some things metals especially if they don't become

00:54:52.880 --> 00:55:00.280
concreted they just dissolve away basically out there or can do if not

00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:05.120
buried in in the clay that sort of encapsulates them but other things such

00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:10.760
as organics can become waterlogged in oxygen free environments within that

00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:17.160
heavy clay and they can be preserved for thousands of years and the fish trap

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:23.040
probably six or seven hundred maybe eight hundred years old perfectly

00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:27.120
preserved because there was no oxygen getting into that mud that could

00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:30.920
actually start the decay process and support the bacteria that would then

00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:36.600
destroy or the fungi that would then destroy the organic wicker basket so

00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:42.080
organics out there the potential for organic preservation is absolutely huge

00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:47.000
and that's shown by two of the vessels that have been recovered from out there

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:53.960
the mega pill wreck a medieval vessel the Barlands farm boat a Roman boat

00:55:53.960 --> 00:56:01.080
that was recovered from the Gwent Euro Park near the motorway junction at mega

00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:06.440
right up on the fan edge there but it probably been sailed up a creek and

00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:11.600
abandoned there but because it was filled with the alluvium that heavy gray

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:16.000
clay no oxygen got in and the wood was perfectly preserved and of course the

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:20.080
Newport ship which was similarly filled with the same clay oxygen free

00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:28.000
environment completely preserved the wood the Barlands farm boat was fully

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.200
excavated by Glamorgan Gwent Archaeological Trust no that that was

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:41.260
whilst I was working I think that was again about the early 90s I think they

00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:44.880
excavated that so probably I was still at university at that time or working at

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:49.600
Cardiff University that was excavated by Glamorgan Gwent Archaeological

00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:54.960
Trust it's been fully published it's got its own volume but it's it's now

00:56:54.960 --> 00:57:01.280
preserved at Newport Museum it's not always on display it depends I think it

00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:06.280
may have been moved for display with the Newport ship it has been displayed in

00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:10.680
John Frost Square in the museum on the Metsanin gallery in the past or elements

00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:19.040
of it have been but the beauty with both the Megapill boat the the the

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:25.040
medieval one and the Roman Barlands farm boat are that they look like boats as

00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:29.760
does the Newport ship you can see the shape and structure the length and the

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:36.400
construction methods so Newport sits on one of the most important collections of

00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:41.680
maritime archaeology in the country and I very much look forward to the day when

00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:45.400
it has a maritime museum that can display all of these vessels together

00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:50.080
because there I can't think of any anywhere better actually to go and see

00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:55.280
the full history from Bronze Age vessels that were planks sewn together

00:57:55.280 --> 00:58:02.080
using withy ties from the willows of the levels right the way through the Roman

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:10.080
medieval vessels up to very nearly Tudor times

00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:20.080
yeah yeah there's the Goldcliff plank and there's one from Caldecott Castle

00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:27.880
Lake as well so we have two vessels there's one plank of what was thought to

00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:32.600
be a Viking ship that was found at Newport dock when Alexandra dock was

00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:37.600
being built but that's been recently dated and I think that Toby Jones has

00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:43.160
recently discovered the likely date for that now is again medieval later

00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:50.000
medieval than early medieval so there is a wealth of maritime archaeology and of

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:56.920
course again how fitting for Newport that the name of the city encapsulates

00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:02.320
its importance it's raison d'etre how appropriate that it has such an

00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:08.600
important collection of maritime archaeology that's just waiting for

00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:13.480
presentation and display I think is one of the things that Newport has as an

00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:18.520
asset that could attract people from the rest of the country and abroad to this

00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:22.960
part of the world to explore this landscape and the seven estuary as a

00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:27.880
communication route and that other people just don't have so I very much

00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:32.680
look forward to the time it will happen one day when when all these vessels are

00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:37.240
are beautifully displayed and interpreted because for whatever reason

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:42.240
and nobody seems to be put to be able to put their hand on it there is just

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:48.360
something innately satisfying to most people about boats they just adore

00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:54.520
looking at and learning about boats and there's been long long understood but

00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:59.160
it's almost as in the way that green is a calming color there is just something

00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:04.800
about vessels maybe it's the skeletal nature of this structure the graceful

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:10.640
lines but most you know many people find boats deeply satisfying and they're a

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:16.600
huge draw so the sooner they're on display together the better

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:23.160
I'm just gonna ask about your fish traps again yeah when you found that fish

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:32.120
trap yeah how did you feel well it'd been found it by it being with um first

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:37.400
located by the survey for the sabbath which was known about they knew where it

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:41.680
was and they could take me straight to it so I was literally taken straight to

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:48.840
it right there is lifted but when I gently cleaned off the surface and found

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:54.040
the stake that had held it in place that's the magic if you like the fact

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:57.280
that it was half sectioned was magical and you could see that it was all there

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:02.760
is in perfect condition that's magical from a survival point of view but when

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:09.840
you get the additional element of the story that human element of the act of

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:16.200
staking the thing to hold it in position that's the magic for me where

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:21.720
you are retrieving that extra part of the process that extra part of the

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:27.040
artifact just to remove the basket is not like the object it's the object and

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:32.160
its stake that the stake that held it in place there you've got the whole

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:37.800
functioning item if you like it tells more of the story to just lift the

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:43.760
basket would have been to compromise it and only lift a part of the the whole if

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:48.040
you like so yeah it was a discovery of the stake that the stake was there and

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:54.000
that was particularly satisfying to me because of the stories that lead on from

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.120
that the way that it worked the way it was held in position the way it was

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:03.240
accessed the way the fish were removed fish are hugely important part of the

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:10.680
diet conversely you go back to the iron age and it's questioned whether the iron

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:16.600
age people really really had fish at all it's very rare in fact I don't think any

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:20.080
fish bones have been found on iron age sites but a lot of iron age sites won't

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:25.400
lend themselves to the preservation of fish bone but it's possible that a fish

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:31.520
were not as certainly not as an important a part of iron age diet as as

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:35.120
it was in medieval times so again you can see different interactions with the

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:41.360
environment and big debates now on fisheries over fishing under fishing

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:46.760
sustainable fishing you name it we can look back at past times when when

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:53.280
reliance on different aspects of the environment were different and again

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:59.760
they it all helps to inform us about perhaps where balance may lie when we

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:09.000
take different approaches to our environment yes yes I grew up in the

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:18.240
area and they they both grew up in in the area too yes I call we used to call

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:23.800
it the Moors if you look at the most 17th century maps early maps they'll

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:33.120
just be a label across sort of from Nash across to mega the more Godwin the

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:40.440
bishop and corresponded with William Camden a lot when he was writing his

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:46.680
first history of Britain Britannia and Camden describes the moor as a fennie

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:53.320
tract that lies beneath the fennage and was considered to be really quite an

01:03:53.320 --> 01:04:00.160
unhealthy place again these these prejudices continue quite late as later

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:08.880
1763 we've got a letter from the vicar of Nash the rector of Nash explaining to

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:12.800
his bishop that he never goes to Nash even though he's the rector of the

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:19.240
parish and he pays a curate to go there because he went there once and he got

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:22.880
the egg and it was nearly the death of him and if he was made to live there in

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:27.520
his parish it would be the death of him and his family so and the previous

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:31.680
bishop said that was okay so he trusts that the present bishop will follow

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:36.380
suit so and and he said that he lives in Ponte pool very nicely and that's no

01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:41.520
intention of ever going anywhere near Nash so you can see that there's this

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:46.680
the moor is the way it was seen and again this Caldecott thing this cold

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:51.840
harbor this cold shelter there were lots of cold harbors and cold harbors were

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:58.360
probably these cold shelters cold cots cold cottages that weren't places of

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:05.720
banishment in in the case of cold harbors they're just seasonal bivouacs or

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:10.760
sort of the equivalent of the camper van or tent where you can be with your

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:15.680
flocks during the summer periods often they don't even have evidence of hearths

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:21.840
for actually cooking there but their shelters that are probably unheated or

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:26.240
largely unheated cold shelters just so that you can be near your flocks or

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:31.480
herds on the levels during the summer months so I think we know that the

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:35.400
place name evidence the archaeological evidence it's all leading towards a very

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:44.200
pastoral and largely the level still our posture and largely cattle based

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:56.480
exploitation well I lived not far from the edge of the moor at Caldecott so we

01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:02.520
just used to travel over the entrance to the seven tunnel for log walks along the

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:10.800
seawall accessed near the anti-aircraft gun in placement near the near what was

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:15.060
then the Caldecott sewage works so there was always a footpath down to the level

01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:21.680
there it passed a Roman farm site at Stoop Hill as it was once called Stoop

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:26.880
Hill and the the rising ground coming up off the Fern edge and I was always

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:32.520
fascinated by the flotsam and jetsam the the driftwood that used to be

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:39.520
distributed in hundreds of thousands of tons along that part of the level and

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:46.080
it seems to have been a long-standing habit of the river to deposit on that

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:52.880
particular tract of the more because and when I later went to look at the parish

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:57.440
registers at Caldecott Church and there are a number of entries of burials in

01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:03.300
the churchyard of parts of a body of a person unknown that get washed up on the

01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:11.180
Caldecott moor and it was fascinating again that's quite a unique entry in a

01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:15.100
burial register you know other parishes aren't going to have parts of a body of

01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:20.260
a person unknown regular not regularly I wouldn't say regularly but from time to

01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:25.940
time entered in the the parish register because they had to be accorded a

01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:32.620
proper burial somewhere within the the consecrated churchyard so it you know

01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:37.420
this habit of the river depositing there was quite you know quite quite a

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:44.200
strong one it seems over a long period of time another odd entry in the burial

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:49.260
register was that there seems to have been certainly at least one occasion

01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:58.820
where soon after the 7th tunnel actually opened for passengers sadly some

01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:05.740
infants were newborns were taken through the tunnel by their mothers but

01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:10.220
didn't come out the other side and were either thrown from trains in the

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:14.620
darkness of the tunnel or or what have you and they were buried at Caldecott as

01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:21.260
well so you know it's it's all about the we've talked about the agricultural

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:25.420
human responses to the environment but as soon as you've got new technologies

01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:32.020
like a tunnel a very long dark tunnel that newly opens people find ways of

01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:38.020
utilizing it that the the the the people that planned it could never envisage

01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:43.780
but they're all recorded there in the registers because these these events took

01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:50.260
you know took place and of course the entrance to the tunnel was was my route

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:56.180
over it over the the bridge if you like over the entrance on to onto the levels

01:08:56.180 --> 01:09:00.180
that link with the tunnel and that access to the other side was always very

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:03.180
strong in my childhood with the knowledge of said book and the pumping

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:10.420
station and the efforts that were the mammoth effort to actually sink the

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:15.660
tunnel because of a great spring that they broke into underneath so that that

01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:23.420
was all a huge part of the geography and that landscape was a very strong a

01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:28.860
strong backdrop to the way I understood my geography which was that travel was

01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:36.380
largely east-west along the edge of the fen you'd either go to the urban

01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:40.780
conurbations in Newport Cardiff or beyond in the westward direction or

01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:47.460
eastwards on to chapstow Gloucester Bristol broadly eastward once the seven

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:53.860
bridge was in position at chapstow during my childhood so it's all east-west you

01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:58.780
don't do that that much southern movement so it always intrigued me

01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:03.860
standing on the seawall at Caldecott you could see the beautiful reflections from

01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:09.220
the lights from the windows at Portishead at sunset and the gleaming

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:15.300
sort of display of the reflected light from the windows there but I'd never

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:19.060
been there and the other could see it and it was a stone so it's closer than

01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:24.780
mega as the stone as the crow flies but I've never been there I didn't know it

01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:32.860
at all I still don't know it well so I've spoken since in Thornbury regularly

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:38.300
and it was sort of 17 to 20 minutes away and yet unless you need to go there you

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:42.300
don't necessarily go there because it's not on that east-west corridor that

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:46.940
you're so familiar with and I'm sure I upset many people when I did a Radio 4

01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:52.300
interview talking about landscape at Redwick recently and I said you know the

01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:55.580
people here on the levels they probably don't have a good knowledge of what's

01:10:55.580 --> 01:11:00.460
the other side of Grey Hill and I maintain that they won't have a detailed

01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:04.060
knowledge of the parishes they might know they travel through it to us or

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:08.820
what have you but they won't know Clanclau very well I bet they won't talk

01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:14.300
Lantricent or Lantricent they don't stop off there whereas on the east-west

01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:18.220
corridor you probably do and those movements are very ancient the Roman

01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:23.620
fortress was placed at Cullion because it controls the lowest crossing point of

01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:27.620
the Asc Gloucester was placed there by the Romans probably because it was

01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:32.100
already there but because it was the lowest crossing point of the seven and

01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:37.780
so this movement in this east broadly east-west what we might call the M4

01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:42.980
corridor is very ancient almost certainly pre-roman certainly Roman and

01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:50.980
post-roman and that informs in my mind future debates with regard to the M4

01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:58.020
relief road or lack thereof because it doesn't matter to me which side people

01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:04.340
fall on there is perfect logic for not building it from environmental impact

01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:11.140
and archaeological impact reasons etc but the one thing you cannot escape is

01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:17.700
that east-west movement is a reality in this geography that is age-old and will

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:24.340
continue for future generations how we deal with that manager is for mines

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:28.340
greater than mine and seemingly greater than a lot of the people that have

01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:35.820
applied their minds to it but it's it's something that is inevitable people will

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:43.060
need to move east-west it's absolutely a given so how that's dealt with is

01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:47.380
something that will have to be grappled with and I think again the past can

01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:52.500
inform us the historic movement has always been ever further south and it's

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:57.460
ironic that the the southern distributor road was south of the M4 and

01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:02.660
any M4 relief road will fall south again so since Roman times what probably

01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:08.460
started off life as the 848 and the ridgeway above it has come down ever

01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:15.140
further south with the M4 the railway line and then and then but the

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:21.060
geographical reality of that is fixed so this is where the past can help no it

01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:25.020
doesn't give us the answer as to what to do but it informs us that this is a

01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:31.020
reality that we can't escape so we need an innovative and the best possible

01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:39.420
solution to what is a given problem that's not going to go away I've done

01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:49.620
very little over there actually because it it hasn't fallen within my area of

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:56.060
geographical sort of upbringing my background or my my world of work the

01:13:56.060 --> 01:14:00.460
Wendlug level is of great interest because there is possible evidence

01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:12.620
there for a more intensive Roman land improvement system possible ancient

01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:17.860
Roman fields has been disputed as to where they are the Roman material sits

01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:22.980
in these ditches but of course there are different ways material can find

01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:27.340
their way to different levels so it's still a matter of dispute as to how

01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:35.180
extensive the Roman drainage system and possible defense was on the Wendlug

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:41.300
level but there are some again important sites at Beysleg by Silica takes its

01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:49.020
name from a Roman isled structure there's a villa there cross Carni

01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:55.220
Indian there's another one Koikurnu so some very interesting and important

01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:59.620
sites again on the Fen edge and then you come down onto the Fen with the later

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:05.540
medieval churches at St. Brides and Peterstone great medieval structures

01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:10.100
that show how important it's certainly Peterstone was it rivals Cardiff as an

01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:15.700
architectural edifice so a very important place in medieval times in

01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:23.380
its own right but but later encroachments or movements down on to

01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:28.160
the onto the Fen edge itself and of course they're important because they

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:34.340
hold some of the flood markers that record the the one flood of 1607 which

01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:42.860
up to that point was the most completely documented and and within

01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:47.620
certainly living memory or fable at the time the most devastating flood that

01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:53.140
had been experienced by most people in the Seventh Estuary.

01:15:53.140 --> 01:16:06.180
I've spoken to a few people who one chap in particular lives in Rocket or I used to

01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:14.060
call it Rogier and to us corrected and he paints a really blissful childhood

01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:21.020
before the M4 going down you know bird nesting fishing yeah and

01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:28.220
Ealing following the Penhay Beagles yeah yeah yeah yeah you're much younger

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:32.220
than that and I think there's a difference I I was fortunate to have

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:36.780
known Derek Upton who was one of the great great people of the levels the

01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:40.980
Seventh Estuary levels research committee is basically dedicated and

01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:45.620
dedicated his website to his memory he was the first person because he used to

01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:53.180
roam around out in the mud and beyond the mud deep out into the estuary and

01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:59.380
places that other people wouldn't dare go but a lot of the archaeology was

01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:04.740
being exposed and eroded out through scouring and he understood it

01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:11.020
incredibly well and he drew the attention of our professional archaeology

01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:15.380
to what was going on out there so there's the Upton trackway that he

01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:20.820
discovered many of the footprints and thanks to him and thanks to people like

01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:26.340
Martin Bell who you know took the baton and run with what was being discovered

01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:32.020
out there by Derek and others and made their own discoveries we have a much

01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:36.460
better understanding now that generation did and the lave net fishermen they they

01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:43.260
they were much more heavily involved my my involvement with the level in

01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:48.780
childhood was just as an observer of it not going out into it in that way but I

01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:53.560
was around to hear the stories you know out at our end in the in the

01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:58.740
Valley I was only told not so very long ago that they used to walk the

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:06.120
curhounds out from it and to places like Coent and the slough which means marsh

01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:11.980
the slough the ancient manor house of Coent and they had kennels there to

01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:17.220
overnight rest them so they could rest out a quite then they would hunt in the

01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:24.220
Neddon Valley down onto the Caldecott levels from slough and all the fences

01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:30.180
weren't barbed wire they were just thin wire so that it didn't damage the horses

01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:33.780
or the hounds while they were hunting back and forth these details you

01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:37.900
wouldn't capture any other way nobody records the archaeology of barbed wire

01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:46.060
fences but these are realities that enabled the hunt and I was told that Lady

01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:56.820
Kerr would anybody that lost chickens to a fox she would pay for the chickens she

01:18:56.820 --> 01:19:01.860
would buy the dead chicken carcasses or pay you the equivalent so that you

01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:06.360
weren't out of pocket so that there was no animosity to the foxes or the

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:09.600
presence of the foxes there was no financial loss to any of the people in

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:15.520
the area so there were plenty of foxes to hunt so it's not necessarily a good

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:19.360
news story but it's the way it's the way society functioned in that time and I

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:23.880
don't go back to that time but I've spoken to people that have a memory of

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:30.600
it or a very distant memory or were told in their childhood of the way it

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:35.740
functioned I was very very fortunate to be a neighbour for a time of Dennis

01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:42.940
Collett who grew up at Carwent and then was a railwayman and had a very good

01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:49.740
knowledge of the area and the levels and lived in Caldecock and the stories he

01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:55.100
tells of they used to test the sort of flow of the water in the Great Spring in

01:19:55.100 --> 01:20:01.020
the early years by treading blackberries and you get the big sort of tub of

01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:04.820
blackberry juice which is a good dye and then you can pour it into the bore

01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:10.200
holes and then they'd go down into the tunnel and wait for the purple black

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:13.660
berry juice to start coming through and then they could time the flow and work

01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:19.540
out the flow through the Great Spring from further upstream at Carwent in the

01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:27.120
Neddon Valley and down into the to the pumping station there the he remembers

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:32.760
stories of the whirly holes that once existed in the Neddon Valley. Neddon

01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:40.320
means whirlpool and there were sink holes down into the cave system just

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:46.400
below Carwent just above Caldecock Castle and they once had whirlpools in

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:51.280
them that people could look down into these these whirling this underground

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:55.840
river that sort of came up to the surface at that point of course they

01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:58.920
were all filled in as part of the tunnel works and then the water level

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:02.720
slightly dropped once they started pumping out the Great Spring and they're

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:07.960
now lost so these things if not recorded in this way through oral

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:12.840
histories or written down anywhere these memories are lost because sadly Dennis

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:17.640
is no longer with us and he didn't live long enough to be recorded in that way

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:23.560
so it'll be for me to pass on the story wherever I can the stories that he

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:31.040
passed on to me and also to ensure that his memory is maintained as somebody

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:36.040
lived in this area and people did used to shoot he used to shoot and he knew

01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:41.760
you know knew how the old way was but with the intensive more intensive

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:48.160
urbanization if you like of southeastern Monmouthshire something that if we look

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:53.000
at the current proposals for the next local development plan is likely to

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:58.320
become a suburb of Bristol as far as we can tell with nearly all development

01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:03.720
that's been put on the table in Monmouthshire south of the 848 basically

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:11.480
then the pressures will grow on in terms of environmental factors on wildlife on

01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:18.240
on the environment and indeed on the road networks because you can only keep

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:24.720
adding more and more people so far before we approach gridlock and the one

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:29.040
thing I've queried about some of the road schemes is that they can very

01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:34.960
successfully bypass Newport very very very easily and quickly with

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:40.440
with road construction but does that then in my mind get you to places like

01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:45.920
Cardiff quicker so that you've just joined a different queue along possibly

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:50.720
a longer queue in a different place I just don't know at the moment everybody

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:55.440
queues in Newport and Cardiff but will you just join a queue that's twice as

01:22:55.440 --> 01:23:01.280
long in Cardiff I just hope that our infrastructure and our planning is

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:07.920
sufficiently robust that we can solve the problems not just move from around

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:12.880
just check how long

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:20.160
so I think perhaps it's that that's nearly an hour and a half I think I

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:23.960
might end it there because if there's anything else you'd like to add no I

01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:28.760
think I think we've sort of rambled around the levels quite well I'm just

01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:32.080
gonna stop that there now
