Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Interviewee Lorraine Castellano.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We're in the Swicker office and today's date is the 21st or 22nd even of October 2015.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Before we start, Lorraine, would you be kind enough to spell your name in full?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:38.000
L-O-R-R-A-I-N-E. Castellano is C-A-S-T-E-L-L-A-N-O.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
That's 10 out of 10, that's well spelled. Thank you very much.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Lorraine, of course I know you as part of what we informally know as the Burley Girls, very much part of the Cardiff Ballest scene.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
How did you first come across Cardiff Carnival?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Well it's part of a yearly event, we always go to the carnival and then we were very very pleased to be asked would we perform once again.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So of course we all jump at the chance because it's another opportunity to dress up and perform.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
One of our shows was called Flying Down to Rio.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So we needed the help and assistance from you guys at Swicker and obviously Adrian is such a whiz with the glue gun and the glitter and wire and everything.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And we needed to know how to make our headdresses for our showgirl costumes and our cage bras.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So we came along to many sessions and the end result, obviously if you go on the page you'll see it, but the end result we just made the most fabulous costumes.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And sequins, feathers, braiding, everything and we shone and sparkled.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And then obviously we performed at the actual carnival itself and we did a few numbers and then we paraded.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000
What was the audience reaction like to see these wonderful Samba showgirls, Burley style, in the centre of Cardiff?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I think they were transported and I think they absolutely thought that's carnival.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
That's what a carnival should have. And we delivered.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
That was big time.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Yeah, we really, really, we knew we...

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Across your group there were hundreds of feathers, weren't there?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I often say there's a lot of bald chickens in China as a result of us.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Whether you believe in it or not, but hopefully we did it as humanely as possible.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I'm sure they're given woolen coats or something to walk around in.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I'm sure they'll be happy.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
A good cause.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
A good cause because they were being shown off to their fall and it was beautiful.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Yes, absolutely.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
We had the weather on our side as well, which was great.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And it was a very, very special time for me because I'd just been diagnosed with a very rare cancer.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So on the Thursday before the carnival, I'd had my first chemo session and I was so determined.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I told my oncologist, there is no way I'm missing the carnival.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And she went, well, I don't know how you're going to be, blah, blah, blah.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
But this is your date. You have to be on it.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Right. Well, we negotiated.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So off I went to Vilyndra, had the session.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
That was Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Costume went on.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And I had my son as an attendant running to the side of me.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Yeah, he's a Marine. So I was in good hands.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Yes. And we just had an absolute blast.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Lots of funny moments. The wind caught our headdresses.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
We had to hold them. Mine was a little bit spiky on the front.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So I had to put a piece of kitchen sponge.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
You're a master of improvisation.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
It was honestly. Yes.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And then it was so much fun. We had lots of photographs.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Everybody wanted the mayor wanted a photograph with us.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Everybody did. So we were very famous.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Stars for one day.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And then we finished the parade and then we all decided in our regalia

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and our beauty, we'd go into where the spoons.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
That's a high class establishment. It was wonderful.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And I think the football was on and the poor gentlemen that were in there,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
they didn't know whether to watch the football come and talk to us.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
They were in a twirl. Yes.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Complete twirl. They were having photographs with us.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I can imagine. It's very rare. Yes.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000
15, 20 beautifully underdressed samba dancers coming to your pub.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I don't think the football would have been looking normally.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
They think they thought they'd been transported to Rio.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Was it Rio? Brazil? The football?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
They absolutely will come.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Was that last year or the year before? Anyway, I think we were a year in advance.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
We were giving them a taste. A foretaste of what was to come.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I think we were giving them a taste of what, you know,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
if you buy your ticket to Rio, you'll get a bit of this.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I'm right thinking the following year, so yeah, in my mind,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
so I can see you there in all your samba finery looking wonderful.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And the following carnival, there was a different theme, wasn't there?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Something a bit more piratical, I understand.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Very much so. This is what we try and do.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
We're all out to shock and to get the mind going of all our audience.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
We're all out there, and they never know what we're going to.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
This is our director.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
We always have to think, OK, it'll turn out OK.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
This is the glorious Fufu Labelle.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Fufu Labelle will definitely get your mind going.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And, you know, us as a group, we just have to say, OK,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and she'll go, run with it, run with it, just, you know, and we'll go, OK.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
So we ran with it, and we were pirates.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Not your everyday pirates. And we had a boat as well.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
We had to, yes, perform with a boat.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
But our costume had to be three in one because we had to have one costume on,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
which we could then do three dances.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
You're like Russian dolls, this is, isn't it?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
A little bit, yes.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And we had nowhere to change.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
It was literally in front of everybody.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
That's the drive-cars, full of soap and air.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And we'd been watching the weather forecast.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
We thought, oh, crumbs, this is going to be a bit tricky.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So you're freezing cold anyway.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
But once you start dancing, you do warm up.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And then we do the first number is the pirates.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
So we're in our full regalia.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And I'd spent many hours again at Swicker with the workshops and the drop-in centres

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
so I could embellish the costume because I wanted to sparkle once again.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
This was completely different.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And so, yes, I was all ready to go.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Then we did the first number, pirates, that goes.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Then we have the music changes and we take a few more items off.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Then we do mine hair.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
From cabaret, which is a classic for the S-track.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
You know, you just think, where's this going?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And that went down really, really well.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And then the finale was the time warp, which you just have to get your head around all of this.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
From the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Yes, and there's no logic in it.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
You can't match it up anything, but it works.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
You see it performed as a cabaret knight.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Huge audience.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Huge audience.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
So people chanting along with you and clapping.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And they love it because they know it.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
They dance with it.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Isn't it the end where you're all on your backs like dying flies and the rest of it?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000
What a way to end the show.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Definitely, yeah, we have to do that.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
That is the best bit.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And you collapse on the floor.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And you need to collapse on the floor because this is, you know, we've done three numbers.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And one after another.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Normally, you get a gap.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Another performer comes in.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And this was in the haze outside St David's Hall, wasn't it?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Yes, and it was all outside.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And it was all public as you can get.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000
We've had photographs which have been taken from the shops surrounding the area.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
But aerial shops.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
So people who were working were taking them from the wind, you know, the bulky areas.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Above TK Maxx and all that area.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
We've had some amazing shops posted.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Big audiences, 500,000 people.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Yeah, it was.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And you had them in the palm of your hands.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
They loved you.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Yes.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Your audience adored you.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And then they follow us on the parade, obviously through Cardiff.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And the weather wasn't as kind on this occasion, but we still did our bit.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Obviously, I love to wear wigs.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000
So my hair stayed dry, but the rest of me, I was absolutely, it wasn't a part of me.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
It wasn't soaked.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Welcome to Cardiff, Wales.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
I know.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And I remember the dye from my fishnets and my boots came out, and my legs and my feet were permanently stained for weeks.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And it was, I just couldn't get it off.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
I used nail varnish, removed everything.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I just couldn't get it off.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
We do like to leave our mark on people.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
That was literally there, wasn't it?

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Yeah.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So we didn't venture into any pub because at the state of us, we all went sort of like home for hot cocoa, I think.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Yeah, hot toddies all around.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Definitely.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.000
But all in all, the carnival for us is a highlight of our calendar.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Yeah.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And it's like, I'm not quite sure about this carnival, not going to be.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
I'm not quite sure I agree.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Well, I don't agree.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
I passionately don't agree.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And I just think it's a little odd.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
It leaves a gap.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And I'm not quite sure how you'll fill it.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
I don't think you will.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
I just find it very odd that we're not having a carnival.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Everywhere has a carnival.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
We're a city.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
It almost goes on.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Carnival is carnival, you know.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And it's all the things that go with it.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
You plan it.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And it's not just the day.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
It's everything.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
I think it's the buildup to it.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:03.000
That's what we, as a group, our Burley girls, that's what we enjoy is all the things that go to make that show.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
That's the structure, the part, the build, and then the show.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And a funny anticlimax afterwards.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
You have to experience that to then build again.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Yes.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
To go to the next one.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Absolutely.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
It's the ups and downs.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
But I think it's not a good thing.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
It's not a good thing.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Obviously, we would like it to be every year.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I don't know.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Maybe we'd have to do a rogue one.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Maybe a rogue one will have to happen.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
I hear what you're saying there.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Something alternative.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Underhand.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Left field.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Definitely.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Pop up.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
A pop up carnival.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
What's it called then?

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Flash dancing.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Carnival flash mob.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Yeah.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
We could easy do that.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
We've got the costumes.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000
We can make the costumes.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
We're giving it away on tape here now.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Watch this space.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
It will happen.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Lorraine, can I say thank you so much for sharing your carnival memories.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000
I'm delighted to say I can award you with the honor of Carnival Queen in posterity and

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
for eternity.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
So bless you and thank you very much indeed.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Thank you.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Enjoy this in years to come.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Thank you very much.
