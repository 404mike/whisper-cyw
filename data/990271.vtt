00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
God in flound prudyai, which essentially means the trees are full of fruit.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
For centuries the fruit trees trunks sweetwood.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Someone by an ancient monk drank deep, taproot sunk, at last became withered, shrunk.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Blessed the sky with blossoms feather-old tree.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
All day through spring's weather gardeners gathered together with tools laid on green heather.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Tangled limbs to neglected bough, poor tree.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Pruning shears needed now to slash branches and allow equilibrium somehow.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Reduced, thinned out and redesigned, grow free.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Green shoots at last unwind, ancient tangle realigned, trees fertility refined.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
A restless gardener, resolute craze bee, preserved the severed shoot to graft onto younger root and ensure continued fruit.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Throughs all that small simile of gardeners gardening for free.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
That ancient tree is our own language, Welsh.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Time cannot squelch such vitality.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Now I am a new man grafted here.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
That new shoot of Welsh to persevere the red dragon's roar rings out clear and loud.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I am proud to be his pioneer.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Guard you gardeners your old blossom dome while I find my roots sunk in new loam.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I'll bear fruit as this poem tries to attest.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Here in the West, a new shoot at home.
