00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920
My name's Jill Willie, it's the first of August, and I'm speaking with Des Lloyd at his home

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:16.240
in Llanier. Right, Des, let's get started now. Let's talk about your early days in the

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.640
longhouse called Roundfield, I believe. Can you take us through the house, what it was

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.440
like if we walked through the front door?

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:31.440
Yeah, I can do. I was born there November 1943. They say if I'd have been a little bit later,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.800
I'd have been called Guy, so that's giving a clue to my date of birth. Yeah, there were mom and dad,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.840
obviously, and three of us. I was the middle one, the only boy, and I had a younger sister

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:52.000
and an older sister. Now, in those days, it was, how can I put it, there's so many different types

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.680
of Welsh longhouse. The cows were under the same roof. We both had a front door. There was only one

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.960
door for us and one door for the cows. Now, we lived in the one end. There were four rooms,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.120
two downstairs and two upstairs, and then there was a solid wall in the middle so the cows couldn't

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.600
get at us, even though we could hear them at night. And they came in through their own door,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:23.200
and there was tie-ins, as we say in Wales, for three cows in there. Now, above the cows

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.400
was what we called the tollant, where we stored hay for the winter. Now, this tollant, it wasn't a

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.760
very secure thing because there were sort of loose poles fixed in the wall, no boards or anything

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.560
like that. And on top of that, you put sort of loose hedging wood. It was old sticks or anything

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.480
like that. So when you were actually putting hay in there, you had to be very careful,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.480
because otherwise you'd be down, if the cows were in there, you'd be on their back in no time and

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:02.880
you'd be in trouble. You'd be kicked. Anyway, the house, well, it was the front door for a time.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.280
As I remember, when the wind used to blow from the east, it came all the way from Radnor Forest.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:16.000
So there was a very useful implement employed at the bottom of the door, a feed sack,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.120
stopped the wind coming in. But when the wind was strong, it used to blow it from the door.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.480
We were absolutely freezing in there. There was the cooking equipment, was a black, what we call a

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:36.480
black-red grate. They did have an old boiler in the thing, but I think that was removed before

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.760
mum and dad came there. Incidentally, they came there in 1938 when they got married.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.560
So mother used to do all her cooking on this open fire. She was a hook above it and she'd have a big

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.600
pot going on that. And there was an oven by the side of it, but you had to get a lot of fire going

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.440
to keep the oven going. So the oven was only used on a Sunday or when she was baking.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:10.160
We managed. We had plenty of food because we obviously kept chickens, ducks and geese for

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:17.680
Christmas. And we had our own milk, mother made butter, never made cheese. And we almost had a

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:25.920
veg garden. And I shall say more about that later. We planted potatoes at a neighbouring farm in

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.680
exchange for doing work at any time when he wanted it sort of thing, which was one of the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.600
things people did in those days. You were planting potatoes on a farm and then in the harvesting

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:45.360
weather you were, you paid back that way. But going back to the Welsh Longhouse, at the end,

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:52.720
we had the cows at the one end and joining that attached to it was the pigsty or pigs cot, as we

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:00.000
call it in Wales. And it was a pig at his little house. It was a slated roof, that was a pitched

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.840
roof. There's a pig, he's a very clean animal. He never soils in his own bed. He ought to come out.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.120
He has his own little yard to do that in. And there was a wall around that. But above that,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.240
there was a hole in the end of the house, obviously to get the hay in. And that was the only way we

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.520
could get the hay in. It was called the pitching hole. Anyway, when it came to harvesting time,

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.640
the only way we could do it, we used to take the door off the pig's house. The pig was banished to

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.240
his living quarters and told us to stay there. And then we put it across the walls. Then the

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.360
horse and cart, which we used then, was brought up alongside. And the man on the cart put it onto the

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.800
door. There was another man on the door who then lifted it through the hatch. And then there was

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:52.640
another man inside who had the most risky job, no health and safety then. And he sorted it out

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.840
inside. It worked very, very well. We never had any problems. Never any problems.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.720
Going back to harvesting, they never had,

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:21.040
we never had any implements of our own until much, much later. So the farmer below us was an

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.000
excellent neighbor. And we obviously, Dad worked for him and I worked for him when I was older.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.680
We always used to borrow his horse and cart. And he'd actually come and cut the hay for us with his

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:39.440
with his mowing machine. And it was pulled by two horses. They'd cut the hay. Then it actually

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.760
turned the hay with the horses. And we'd haul it with what we call in Wales, the gambo, which was

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:52.560
like a cart with four sticks at the end and then runners in the middle and big wheels and cart

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:59.440
horses. They weren't big cart horses. They were sort of a, they depended on speed really. They were

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:06.880
a cross between a Welsh Cob, I would think, and a big Shire. But they were, I can remember one in

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:13.440
particular, she was called Topsy. Now she was one of the most contrary women I've ever met.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.600
She wouldn't do anything she was told. When we came to, if there was a large implement,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:25.120
like what we use a horse rake in those days to get through a gate, and it was probably about

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:32.400
one inch each side, we knew damn well that she would not go through it without taking a run at

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.440
it. So we used to have to stop and reverse her through as otherwise there'd be no wheel left on

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:46.000
the rake. And another one of her traits was when we were unloading the hay, like say putting it

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.920
in on the door and then going up into the thing. And after that, when we had a three bay Dutch bar,

00:06:52.480 --> 00:07:00.000
she used to be tied to the hedge while we were unloading. But she had her own agenda. And when

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.560
she heard the pike, which we were shifting the hay off with, hit the bottom of the cart,

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:12.080
she decided to reverse out on her own. So whoever was on the cart, if they weren't aware of what

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:18.240
was happening, they were on their back underneath. She had many, I shouldn't say it, a slap on the

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:26.480
backside for that, but she was a lovely old pony in her way, but she was a contrary lady,

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:32.720
there's no doubt about that. Well, I think those animals could really write a book on their own,

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.520
Des, and I'm sure you could as well. Well, that was an absolutely fascinating insight into

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.480
farming and the methods and the places of probably almost a bygone era, which we'll be.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.440
Let's get back to you now and your early life. You lived in Llanier, but you didn't go to school

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.880
in Llanier. I understand there wasn't a school there. So what about your schooling? Where did

00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:01.440
you go? How did you get there? The schooling? I went to the Oxford Road Primary School in

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:08.400
Llandrind at Wells. Now, I didn't, I think I started school when I was about six. And I can

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.960
remember my mum taking me first of all, and I wasn't very pleased with it. I wasn't very pleased

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:18.960
at all, but I soon got the hang of it. And then we used to have to walk. Mum used to come and

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:26.800
collect me, because only the elder children went on the bus. So we had to walk, but I soon got fed

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:33.200
up with that. And father purchased a bicycle for me for the sum of five pounds. And we're gentlemen

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:39.360
who since passed away a long time ago in Howey, but there we are. But unfortunately, it was too

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:46.960
big for me to reach the saddle. So the saddle was removed. A sack was tied around the frame. So I

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:53.280
wouldn't injure myself. We'll leave that to people's imagination. And I used to ride the bike to

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:59.280
school. And I soon got very used to this cycle. And at the time there was what we called the garage

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:04.320
corner. They used to have petrol pumps there. And there was a haulage business operating from

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.880
there. Now this corner is a right angle. So I could get as much speed as I could coming down

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:14.560
through the village. And then the object of the exercise showing off, of course, was to ground

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:23.680
the pedals on the road. And I had some impossible angles. Anyway, that was that. And I can remember,

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.040
well, there were two of us actually then. There was a lad I've been friends with for all of my life.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:36.880
And we were told off for overtaking the school bus going down the Cwm pitches. By the bus driver,

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:44.240
Jim, I can remember him well. He wasn't the fastest in the world. He'd probably been faster

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.040
in reverse. But I can remember we overtook him going down the pitches. And then we were called

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.600
in to see the headmaster. And he said, we shouldn't do that, which was against the road regulations

00:09:53.600 --> 00:10:00.960
or what have you. Anyway, going back to primary school. Primary school, yeah, I enjoyed that

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:10.320
up to a point. And then I passed the GCSE, whatever, no, the 11 plus in those days,

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.960
and went to the grammar school. And the grammar school then was up Wellington Road. It was the

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:23.680
grammar and the modern, as we called it then, together. Then after a couple of years,

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:32.400
that they built a new school, which is the present school. So I believe, and we moved down there and

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:41.680
the modern school, as they say, it stayed up there. Well, it sounds as though you and your friends

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.760
on those bicycles were really a force to be reckoned with. Yes. Well, let's get away from

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:55.680
education now. Let's get on to your working life. Would you like to tell us a little bit about that?

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:06.560
Yes, I joined the post office as a counter clerk in 1961. Now I was appointed, in those days,

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:12.160
it was a good job. Probably is now, I don't know. Anyway, I was appointed for Bills Wells.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:18.320
My first experience was on the counter in Bills Wells. I wasn't there long in Bills because there

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:25.520
was a lad who was working in Llandrind and Wells, and he lived in Bills Wells. He wanted a direct

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:31.280
transfer back, so it suited me grand. So I was transferred to Llandrind and Wells. Now one thing

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:38.560
I remember, I was a very shy lad, believe it or not, when I started in the post office. I'd never

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.920
used the telephone in my life. I know people will find it hard to believe today with all this

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:49.680
modern technology. So one of the lads who was working with me or training me used to go into

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.160
the sorting office where the mail was, and he used to make phone calls and make me answer them

00:11:54.160 --> 00:12:00.000
in the things so I get used to using the phone. I soon got the hang of it. I must admit I can spend

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.640
a lot of time on the telephone now. But one thing I've got to say, and if anybody's listened to this

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:09.760
who's in the radio area, I've got to give a great compliment to my old friend Harvey Pugh.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:18.400
Harvey trained me in Llandrind and Wells, and he was very, very good to me. We remained friends

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:26.400
for practically the end of his life. I'm sorry, I didn't know he'd passed away until a few years

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:31.600
after. But there we are. But Harvey was very, very good to me. He trained me well.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:39.920
One thing I remember, it was in the September of 61, and the International Six Days Motorcycle

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:47.360
Trials was based in Llandrind and Wells. So I had a quick baptism of all different languages,

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:52.800
people asking for this, people asking for that. But it was very, very interesting.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:00.000
I really loved it because I obviously loved bicycles and motorcycles, and I've still got

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:07.040
a great collection of badges and memorabilia that the teams gave me when they were coming

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:15.200
into the counter. I can remember that very well. I stayed on the counter, and then in those days,

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:22.160
it was a head post office in Llandrind and Wells. We had the writing room where different tasks

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:28.320
were undertaken. There was a staff branch, or what they called, and then there was the wages

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:33.200
and the accounts and all that. I worked my way through that. Eventually I got promotion,

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:41.680
and I ended up as the staff, well, executive officer they called us, but now I believe they

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:50.400
call them HDs or whatever. By that time, we'd actually taken over Brecon area and Newtown area.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:55.920
So the whole of my patch was Powys. It was from the Storey Arms, almost to Lake Burnway.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:03.600
And I think there were about 200 staff altogether, varying from sub postmasters to postmen to

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:09.920
auxiliary postmen, county clerks, the whole works. And I really, really loved the job. You could go

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.400
out in the car in those days, and of course there were no mobile phones. Nobody could get hold of

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:22.240
you. You were your own boss. And one thing about it I've got to say is the sub postmasters, they

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:28.080
were a breed apart. Without exception, they were excellent. And the first thing, no matter what you

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:34.160
went to do in an office, you had to have either breakfast, tea, dinner or supper or whatever.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:42.400
That was essential. No matter what, you had to have that. And I've always got on, well, I think,

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:50.560
got on well with people. I like talking to people, and I thoroughly enjoyed that element of the job.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:15:02.720
At the end, I married a colleague, and then the post office was changing. It wasn't a service

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:09.920
industry as such. The way I saw it, and many others as well, it was to make money, and that was it.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.080
Yes, there was a certain element of service, but it was certainly getting less and less.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:22.080
And when the chance came to take redundancy, because Landrind and Wells was what we say then

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:32.800
regraded as a post office, I took redundancy with my wife, and we left. And that started another

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:40.960
chapter in my life. Before we go on to that other chapter, can I say you've obviously met a lot of

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:45.840
people, had a lot of experiences, and you're obviously a very quick learner. You could write

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:53.440
another book on that in itself, I'm sure. Can you talk about any interesting people, any unusual

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:58.960
people who used to deal with you professionally or perhaps just came in to buy stamps?

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:05.040
Oh, yes, I can. There were thousands. Winford Vaughan Thomas used to come in.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.800
Winford Vaughan Thomas is probably well known. He used to come in on a Wednesday.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:19.520
He was a chap with me. They were both in the Second World War, and I used to listen as a youngster to

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:25.760
the conversations, and it was wonderful to hear. But there were characters, numerous characters.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:33.440
And there was a chap in Landrind and Wells. He used to come in. He was a betting man,

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:39.840
and he used to do his polls and that. He had a little dog with him. I can remember one Saturday,

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:45.840
the postman, what we had then was what we called the front office box. It was a letter box. You

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.000
put the letters in from outside, or you could put them in from inside. And it was always taken out.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.320
It was a sack and emptied and taken through to be sorted. Anyway, the chap came out from the sorting

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.880
office, and he could see the little dog wandering around, and the gentleman was up at the counter

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:05.120
buying his postal orders, whatever you did in those days. And he took the little dog,

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:11.280
and he put the dog in the box, and he shut the door, and the dog was in the letter box.

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:17.760
Well, all hell broke loose then. Everybody was looking for the dog. You could hear the dog barking.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:22.320
You couldn't find him. The chap was running in and out of the office. People were looking everywhere

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:28.720
for this dog. Eventually, somebody twigged that he was in the box, and the dog had to be retrieved.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:34.720
That was a great one. And there was another one. We used to then close at half past six,

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.800
but then it was brought down to six o'clock. And there was a business

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:46.240
not too far away from the office in Llandrind and Wells. And we used to have to balance to the penny

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:51.760
every day then. And of course, when it came to half past five, things like that, we started writing

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:57.520
things down. And so we'd only have to just do a little bit, and we'd be balanced in 10 minutes.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:03.360
And there was a chap, and he used to wait to the last minute. He'd wait till the last minute,

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.600
and he'd run down the street, and he'd come in, and he'd run all sorts of things like insurance

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:13.040
stamps and stamps. So if you'd written them down, I think he just did it for devilment.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:19.440
Anyway, one day he was caught out. The gentleman who was the cleaner, he was in charge of shutting

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:26.080
the door, and the chap must have got his timing a little bit wrong. And I can see him now, and the

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.400
cleaner was at the door with a bolt in his hand, ready to put the bolt in, and he was running down

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:35.200
the street shouting, please don't shut the door, please don't shut the door. But he shut the door.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:46.960
Say no more. Oh, there were numerous people, and lovely people. Yes, we used to have a few.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.760
We would have a bit of a, perhaps a stern conversation, shall I put it with. But

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:57.280
the majority of people that came in then, they were old school, and we never had any problems

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:02.160
whatsoever. If you were good with them, they were good with you. But that's the way it should be.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.920
Well, those are some of the many people who've touched your professional life, and

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:13.680
I'm sure you've got lots of very fond memories of your life in the post office.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:27.120
Was there a noise or something? No, it was the postman. Oh, I see. He's found the bloody dog.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:40.400
Right, let's continue now, Des, with the new venture that you and your wife went into.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.880
I think it was something to do with cars, wasn't it? Obviously, a very much of a passion for you.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:54.960
Yes, it was not cars. It was the Mini, the proper Mini, as we say, not the BMW so-called Mini as

00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:01.600
they've got today. It was the Mini that was first produced in 1959. I'd always had a great interest

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:10.160
in cars, and I had a Mini. It was a Mini Cooper, and I always enjoyed fiddling with them, even

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:16.320
though I wasn't a trained mechanic. I'd worked with a lot of very, very good mechanics who taught

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:24.640
me an awful lot of things. When we left the post office in 1985, we decided to start our own little

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:31.360
business. Why not Minis? That was my wife and myself, and we were called the Mini Man and the

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:38.720
Mini Woman by many. The majority of our business were for youngsters. In those days, they couldn't

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:43.360
borrow money from the banks. The banks weren't lending, so whatever savings they had or whatever

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:48.720
their mum and dad would give them, they used to come to us. Mostly, they were their mum and dad.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:53.200
Perhaps they hadn't even passed their test. They used to say, have you got a Mini, or can you

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.920
build a Mini for us? We used to find an old one and do whatever needed doing to it.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:06.480
They'd have the Mini. It was a very personal business. As I say, even though my wife and

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:13.280
myself never had any children, our family was very, very large. Characters, well,

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:24.800
they were all mad. They were very, very quiet when they came here. They were driving perfectly.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:31.200
Many of the time, a policeman has said to me, Dez, I saw one of your Minis going through Middleton

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.600
Street in Llandrindard Wells. It was doing much more than 30 miles an hour. I used to say,

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:42.640
well, that was sold four years ago. I can't drive every Mini. But that's it. I can remember one

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:49.840
tale in particular. It was a young lady. She was taught by her dad then how to check the oil.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:57.360
Unfortunately, she was checking the oil when the car was on the uphill. She rang me one day and

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:03.120
she said, when I start my car, I can't see anywhere for smoke. Anyway, she brought the car here.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.880
To cut a long story short, there should have been eight pints of oil in it. I think it was as much

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:14.240
as you could get in it. When she revved it up, the property across the field just disappeared in

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:19.600
smoke. I said, the next time you check the oil, make sure it's on the level. At least there was

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:25.760
plenty in it. We had a few here that when they took the dipstick out, there wasn't any oil in it at

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:33.040
all. Thankfully, even though some of the lads and the lasses had some horrendous crashes,

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:40.960
no one was hurt. That was the main thing. We did that for 15 years. But then, of course,

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:47.840
the banks were lending money willy-nilly, as they say, excuse the expression, Joe.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.320
They didn't want to beat up all Mini then. Most of them, they wanted a GTI or whatever

00:22:54.320 --> 00:23:01.360
was the going thing at the time. So our customers dwindled and we didn't want to go into anything

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.840
else. So we decided to call it a day. There was no point in working for the tax man.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:12.880
We retired gracefully. What an interesting chapter of your life. I'm sure you touched

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:19.360
the lives of a lot of people and made a lot of friends and helped and influenced a lot of people

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:26.160
as well. Now, you say you weren't much of a mechanic. Well, I'm sure you were, but you were

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:31.600
a rallying person too, weren't you? Can you tell us a little bit about your rallying experiences

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:40.000
over the years? Yes, well, rallying. Well, my old friend, he's still going. He's struggling a bit at

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:47.280
the moment. He used to live on the next farm to me and he was very, very keen on cars. We grew up,

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:53.760
I've known him since he was six. I think he was always like me, a bit of mad as a box of frogs,

00:23:53.760 --> 00:24:00.400
but there we are. Anyway, I can remember he had a Mini and he decided he was going to go racing.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:09.920
The first meeting we both went, I went with him. It was at Landau down on the old airfield

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:16.720
at Cowbridge. I'd never been, I'm not ashamed to admit it, I'd never been far. So I had the

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:23.120
Batholomew Road Atlas navigating and my best glasses and we set off. Well, I think we should

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:29.360
have got there in about an hour and a half. It took us three by the time we negotiated everywhere.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:35.120
Anyway, he enjoyed the meeting and after that he did circuit racing with Minis and we used to go

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:40.480
to Brands Hatch, Silverstone, Castle Combe, all those places. And then he decided he was going

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:48.320
rallying. He got the rallying bug. And so I did a lot with him on the rallying, but going back to

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:58.320
myself, I did quite a few road rallies and also as well organized rallies. And what we used to do as

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:03.760
well, a gang of lads, we always used to hire a mini bus or a couple of vans and we'd go to rallies

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:10.240
in Scotland, the Isle of Man and places like that. We really used to enjoy ourselves and we made an

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:17.600
awful lot of friends and I'm still enjoying rallying now. I still go out even though I'm

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:22.880
getting on a bit. I don't compete. I haven't competed for years, but I still know many of

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:28.400
the people and I still enjoy watching rallies with my old friend. There's only two of us left. There

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:33.440
used to be three of us. They used to call us the last of the summer wine, but unfortunately we lost

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:39.840
one last year to a heart attack. So that's life. So you just enjoy every day as you can.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:44.960
Well, you can. It's obviously a very important part of your life, even though perhaps you're in

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:52.080
more of a spectator or specter, sedentary role at the moment, but I mean, you're still seeing

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:58.320
so many people who are enjoying it as much as you used to. Oh yes, I'm sorry to interrupt,

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:03.120
Jill, but yes, but rallying's changed now from a spectator point of view.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:11.440
It's, you would call it probably now an anti-social sport and you're not allowed to go and watch where

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:18.480
you want to go. They've got designated areas for spectators and old people like me. I shouldn't say

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:24.800
that word. I know it's just a number, but we've always done and we will think we've got an element

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:30.160
of common sense. We always stood far enough back from the, and having done it yourself, you know,

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:36.800
what to do. But it's the way it's going and it has to be controlled. They have so many controls.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.920
It's like health and safety. You don't do anything. It's got to be authorized for this,

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:47.760
authorized for that. And personally, I can see the writing on the wall and a lot of the rallying in

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:53.360
this country will cease, which is unfortunate because some of the rallies, they're quite big.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:58.880
They bring an awful lot of money into the area, accommodation and federal and all the rest of it.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:05.280
But what will happen is it'll vanish from this country and it will flourish in Ireland,

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:09.600
there's no southern Ireland, and also on the continent where there's not so many rules and

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:15.200
regulations. But that's my own personal view and I don't think I'm alone in saying that.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:22.640
I suppose everything changes, doesn't it? Not always for the better. Des, it's been wonderful

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:28.800
sharing your experiences. We could talk all day, couldn't we? Before we finish off,

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:35.280
you're obviously a Radnish person through and through. Now, Radnish has their own dialect,

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:40.240
perhaps we could call it a language even. Now you've got quite a few up your sleeve. Can we

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:49.280
have some real Radnish expressions before we finish up? Well, Radnish expressions and

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:54.000
Radnish language, I'll just say before I've only got a couple because they just come in normal

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.680
conversation to me. There was a gentleman that taught me English in the grammar school in

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:07.680
Andoran and Wells, Mr. Peter. He was a wonderful gentleman and at that time there was a market in

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:13.120
Llanbad and Vannad and he used to go to Llanbad and Vannad and he used to sit there and listen to the

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:18.880
farmers talking and he used to say that he could hear many, many traces of the old Queen's English.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:23.520
Anyway, that's as an aside. Now there's one, there's a couple here. Now this was one of my,

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:28.160
my dad always used to say this. If there was a problem or anything he used to say,

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:34.240
don't worry, it all brings night. And there's another one about somebody who was a bit mean.

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:41.600
You'll have to excuse the language. He used to say, well, he's as tight as a bull's bum in flytime

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:47.120
or variations on that. And if anybody was from the rural community would understand what I'm saying.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:53.600
And there's another one when we were making hay before a thunderstorm,

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:59.120
you'd be a bit of loose hay on the ground and it would pick it up. And there was a couple around

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:03.120
here and they used to say, ah, this is the whiffle before the storm. In other words, the wind before

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:08.800
the thunder. And there's another one, which somebody who thought quite a bit of himself,

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:12.560
and you would say to him, where's the come boy through the glatt or over the hedge.

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:18.000
But most people would know if they were a radnisher, what a glatt is.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:23.520
Yeah, it's usually tied up with string though, but that's another story. And there's another one,

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:29.760
everybody can manage a kicking horse except the bugger who owns him. And another one, he who

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:35.120
labours and does his best goes down the road along with the rest. And there are many, many more.

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:40.640
I'm sure you've got a lot up your sleeve. Des, thank you very much. It's been wonderful talking

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:46.080
to you. Thank you. Can I say, can I say thank you, Jill? It's been very, very,

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:50.560
I feel privileged to be able to do it because I said to you over the years that I've been doing

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:56.160
family history, the many, many people that have given up their time to talk to me and tell me

00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:00.480
stories. Thank you very much. Well, thank you for sharing. Thank you.
