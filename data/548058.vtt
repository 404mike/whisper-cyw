00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
My women, be guard at your feet at the wheel,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
For you so many we can not give a man,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
My life, knowing that men can come and help you,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
My pride, a little wing, and pride for me.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
My women, be guard at your feet at the wheel,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
My women, a little wing, my women.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
My women, a little young, a sassy young,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
A serene man with all the peace I can bear,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And he'll be like a shawty foamy or he,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
A young and a different he or he.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
My women, a little young, a calm and fair-tear,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
My women, a little young, a brave youth, my women.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
My women, find yourself, my women, find mine,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
For in the end, ahead to the light,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
My men, guard at your feet at the wheel,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
My women, a little young, a sassy young,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
A serene man with all the peace I can bear,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And he'll be like a shawty foamy or he,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
A young and a different he or he.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
My women, a little young, a calm and fair-tear,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
My women, a little young, a brave youth, my women.
