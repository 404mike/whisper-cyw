WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
On the blue land, well then, the pre-Odo of the Railway.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And Mrs. Williams, T-Mine, appeal.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Guadu, we hang, go back to them.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And we have the new one, T-Mine, and appeal.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And then, right, we show the Domingo.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We go with the little pearl, and a ray.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And we pray for it, the first time.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
In the first chapter of the Bible, we pray for the Eucharist.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And, in the last year, the Jews lived in Morwa House near the bond.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You know, Morwa House, right here in the first house,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
in the middle of the city of Gorren, near the town of Llywynor.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We were the first Jews in the bond.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
At the beginning of the year, we had to move the T-Mine,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
where the other one was, to the old town of Dje.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And they were, in Morwa House, a town near Llywynor,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
to the first street in the bond.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Now, do you know what the T-Mine is?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It's a small bond.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I think it's in India.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I don't know if you know, but it's in America.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I don't know if you know.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I don't know.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I remember Watkin Wynne, why is he so fond of you?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
In America, like other nations,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
he didn't treat you like Watkin Wynne did he?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But they persuaded the late Matthew Jorreit, you know, to agree.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I bought a big, small boat,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and I carried it to the U.S.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And I went with it to the city of Berlin,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Ollerburt, in Lland.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
But when I saw Mrs. Matthews,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
the small boat,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I went down to the ground,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and I saw that the boat didn't reach the ground,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and I went down to the sea.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And the boat didn't reach America.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And I remember, I told people,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I have a small bond,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and I went to the city of Lodeo,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and I went to the sea,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and I saw Matthews, and I thought,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I'm going to help him.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
He was a little bit of an Arab,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I told him,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I'm going to make a big bond,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and I told him,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I'm going to make a big bond with the U.S.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
because it was a great job,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
a great job for me,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
to have a bond with the U.S.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I want to tell you about it.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And the way he did it,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
he was cutting every piece of wood,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and he saw the wood,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and he went down to the sea,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and he saw a big rock,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and he saw a big rock,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and he thought,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
oh, there's a big rock there,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and if I go there,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I'll find a big bond with the U.S.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And he cut the wood,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and he cut the wood,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and he had a knife,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and he cut the wood around the wood,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and he said,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
dear me,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I'll cut every single one of them,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and I'll put them in the box.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
It was a big job.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And he said,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
he said,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
the box is a big one,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and he said,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
the box is a big one,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and of course,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
the box was a big one,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And he went down to the sea,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and he saw a big rock,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and he cut the wood,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and he thought,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
oh, there's a big rock there,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and he cut the wood,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and he found a big one,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and he put it in the box.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And he saw a big rock,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and he said,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I'll put another one in the box.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And he put the rock in the box,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
and he cut the wood,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and he found a big rock,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and he put two of them in the box.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And he said,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
two big rocks.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And he cut the wood,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and he said,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and he found a big rock,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
and he put two of them in the box,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and he cut the wood.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And he put two of them in the box,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and he cut the wood.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
He cut the wood.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And he thought,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
oh, here's another one.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Oh, he put another one.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And he cut the wood.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And the people in the room are not in the group.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And they're here to learn and learn at the Royal College of Surgeons.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And they've got a grimy thing to do.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
If you don't learn your language, you're going to break your own body.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And I don't like to have conversations like that.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Long ago, people used to say,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I don't like the way things are.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I want to have a little bit of a conversation with them.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Small people,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
you know, they're not going to do anything to me.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
I don't know what to do.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
I don't know what to do.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
They're very, very good at it.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
The great British, the great British.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
A thousand of them.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And Matthew was a good man.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
He was a very good man.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And I don't know how many of them are still alive.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
I don't know.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
I don't know if they're alive.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I don't know if they're alive.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
I don't know.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
I've been in the room for nine years.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I've been in the room for nine years.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And I've been defending the gun.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And someone said,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Now,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And as physical 230 here

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000
But Matthew said he had given the man a big bottle of water to drink.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
He wanted to drink, of course.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
He didn't have a drink with him, but he had it in his hand.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
I thought to myself, I can't imagine what he was thinking at the time.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I thought he was a good man.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I was a little boy who drank water.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
I was a little boy, and I had a little thing in my hand.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
I didn't have a drink with me.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I was a little boy, of course.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
I was nine years old when I got drunk.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.000
They were all saying, I want to drink coffee with coffee.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
I was drinking coffee for two days.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I drank coffee for two days.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Of course, I don't know if I'm drunk, but I was a little boy.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
I was nine years old when I got drunk.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I drank coffee for two days.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
I was a little boy.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
I was a little boy.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
The way I was drinking coffee.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Slowly, slowly, I drank coffee with coffee.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I thought to myself, Matthew,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
then the Holy方 student,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
I thought to myself, Matthew,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
then the Schueter student,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I thought to myself, I think,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
then the Schueter student,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
I thought to myself, I think,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
then the Schueter student,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
I'm going to tell you.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
The lamb has a key.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Let me go to the street.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Let me go to the gumbo gum.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
I'll have sweet beer in the bowl for me.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
I'll be back in a little bit.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
I'm going to put a hand in the gumbo gum.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And the mother more than galore is the one.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Doctor,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
I'm going to the right.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
And then I give William.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
You know my William, you know?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
No,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
No,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
I'm going to tell you.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
He's my father,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
no.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
I'm going to touch him from the front.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
He's my father,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
he's my father,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
and he knows my name.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And my name is William.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
He's going to write to me.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
He's going to write to me.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
He's going to write to me.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I need to prepare for the不行.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.960
Oh, but I do remember.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.960
And he got me on the cad and said,

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.440
but I love him now.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:52.960
But when I go to the grass back,

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.960
he asked me where I got John.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.440
I'm going to ask him.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.440
I got John in this keyboard.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.920
Let you soon as you knew them.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.400
Oh, my will around.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.880
Did he go get him?

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.320
And I said, oh, my will around.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.280
And John, I'm going to ask him.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.120
I got John in this keyboard.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.120
And I'm going to ask him.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.120
I got John in this keyboard.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.120
Let you soon as you knew him.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.120
Oh, my will around.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.120
Did he go get him?

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.120
I'm going to ask him.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.120
I got John in this keyboard.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.120
Hold on

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.120
and act out the mission of the gift.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.120
And they are in acturion.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.120
For the most part, they are in acturion.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.120
Very, very, very good.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.120
And then, feeling left,

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.120
go into your pot of cove.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.120
That was the destination, wasn't it?

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.120
Go into your pot of cove.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:33.120
The Bible was in it.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.120
And the story goes,

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.120
And the story goes,

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.120
And the story goes,

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:49.120
That you go into the pot of cove.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.120
There, that's where it was.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.120
Yes.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.120
But you go into the pot of cove.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.120
To your pot of cove.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.120
Oh.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.120
Oh.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.120
Oh.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.120
Good night.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.120
Good night.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.120
Good night.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.120
Good night.

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.120
Good evening.

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.120
Good evening.

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.120
Good evening.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.120
Good evening.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.120
Good evening.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.120
Good evening.

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.120
Good evening.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:33.120
Good evening.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.120
Good evening.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.120
Good evening.

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.120
Good evening.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.120
Good evening.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.120
Good evening.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.120
Good evening.
