00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
In January 1919 and for all of 1919, Prime Minister David Lloyd George had a considerable

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.040
amount of information going across his desk. Information not seen by the general public.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.840
Generally I suspect known by the press, but the British Empire was one of his many concerns.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.880
And this is just a brief summary of some of the major things that were happening and he would

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:37.040
have become aware of. In January 21st 1919, the Sinn Fein members who'd been elected in the 1918

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.040
general election and who had said they would not take up their seats in the House of Commons in

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.800
Parliament chose to declare an independent Irish Republic. And so for the first time,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.200
Dale Aaron met in Mansion House Dublin. At the same day the Anglo-Irish War started,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.760
two Royal Irish constabulary men were killed in an ambush at Solo Head Beg in Tipperary.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.600
Later that same year, Eamon de Valera, the leader of Escape from Lincoln Prison,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.560
in South Africa, 70,000 mainly black African miners went on strike at the Witch What's Around.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.640
Their strike was disciplined and organised and the government threw police cordons around their

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.440
compounds. The troops broke through the workers barricades with bayonets fixed, killing three and

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.000
wounding 40. Later police and armed white civilians attacked a meeting of solidarity with a strike in

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.960
miners killing 80 and wounding 80. Meanwhile in Cape Town, the first South African Indian

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:54.320
conference was convened and the Indians there resolved to agitate for full civil rights and

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:02.640
to resort to civil resistance until those rights were granted. Meanwhile on the 13th of April 1919

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.720
in Punjab, the Jallanwala Bagh massacre, also known as the Amritsar massacre, occurred.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.560
Civilians, unarmed civilians I should say, had assembled for a peaceful protest to condemn the

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.520
arrest and deportation of two national leaders, Satyapal and Safuddin Kichlu, and also to honour

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.000
the Sikh festival of Basarqi. Acting Brigadier General Reginald Dyer, with his battalion of

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.880
Indian Army and Gurkha troops, fired rifles into the crowd of unarmed Indian civilians.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.200
They were to kill between 300 and a thousand and a thousand were wounded, 14 of which were children.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.240
But this is the power of the press because when Dyer returned to England, the press demanded a

00:02:52.240 --> 00:03:00.320
public collection for, as Rudyard Kipling described him, the hero of India and he received 26,000

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:08.240
pounds, nearly a million pounds in modern terms. China was the largest non-European

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:17.600
participant in World War I. It fought with the Allies and most people don't know that because

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:26.480
so much of 1919 is secret history. China joined the war because Germany at the siege of Singtao

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:35.520
in 1914 had captured Shandong, the birthplace of Confucius. China was not allowed to become

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:46.480
a combatant because Japan objected. So instead they sent thousands of volunteers who repaired

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.840
tanks, dug trenches, carried munitions at the front line. But when China turned up at the Versailles

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:02.640
treaty signing, they were told Shandong was being given to Japan. The delegation returned

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:13.760
to Beijing and the first student protests occurred on the 4th of May 1919. That May the 4th movement,

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:22.800
an anti-imperialist cultural and political movement, was the beginning, it has been argued,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:30.560
of communism as a cultural shift in China. Meanwhile across the Caribbean,

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:40.640
the war had resulted in longer working hours, no increase in wages, higher prices of goods and poverty.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.720
The returning soldiers and merchant seamen, many of which had been forcefully repatriated

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:56.480
after serving in World War I, were angry and disillusioned. This was a critical time in the

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:03.440
rising demand for independence and the creation of the first trade unions and the first political

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:11.920
parties. In Canada, June the 21st 1919, Royal Northwest Mounted Police fired a volley of bullets

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.800
into a crowd of unemployed war veterans, killing two in what was known as the Bloody Saturday

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:26.880
of the Winnipeg General Strike. David Lord George saw a continuing picture of a collapsing empire.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:35.600
Egypt Civil War by 1922. Egypt was a freed country. Afghanistan Civil War.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:44.400
Ceylon. Australia where returning soldiers attacked people they saw as communists.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.360
And there was much more. And across the empire there was revolt and demonstrations.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:59.440
And across the empire, new legislations and increasing level of extreme violence

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.320
by the state or with the agreement of Downing Street. So what David Lloyd George saw

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:16.800
was a collapse of the British Empire and the fact that those in the empire were not going to return

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:26.640
to the previous world where London decided everything and money decided everything.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:35.440
And his fear was a shift towards socialism but even bigger a shift towards Bolshevism.
