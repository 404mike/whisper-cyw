00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040
There was a line, I remember, Montgomery was split in half.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.520
We used to have the top versus the bottom,

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.760
and the tree opposite D.R. Jones's,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.520
which is Roger Jones and John Jones's granddad's butcher shop

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.000
halfway up the town.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.920
If you lived in the bottom half,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.160
you obviously played for the bottom of the town

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.440
against the top.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.640
And would you believe there were enough youngsters then

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.440
to form...

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.280
It was a very competitive game in whatever.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.640
It could be cricket, it could be football.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.800
And do you remember who would win those games

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.600
at the bottom half or the top half?

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.600
Well, yes, again, the bottom half of the town

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.120
always seemed to have better footballers.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.800
Or I don't think we had more,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.840
but we had one or two sort of gifted people.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.800
And as I mentioned, Jeffrey Windsor and Edward Windsor

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.120
from Hen Dommann and the Robinson family

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.320
the bottom, I would think,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.880
would probably come out on top most times.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.280
But I think if you talk to some of the other people,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.480
they wouldn't agree with me.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.840
And was there any sort of seasonality to this,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.240
i.e. football in the winter,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.360
or was it just any time you'd play any game?

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.480
Yeah, we played all our matches in top versus bottom

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.600
down on Windsor's field, which was down Sarkley Lane.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.000
And that was football.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.720
And then of course we did the same thing

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.720
in the summertime for cricket.
