00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
There was humpback whales off Annis Lockton many years ago.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.040
I was...

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.440
Winston Paul Yeats saw them, Peter's dad,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.640
and there was photographs knocking around.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.480
I'd gone down there in the morning to do a two-hour trip.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.120
Nothing happening at Annis Lockton, came back,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.760
came up and picked up Peter Evans and a couple of other people.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.800
I said, oh, don't forget Annis Lockton's dead down in Annis Lockton.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.560
Let's go out, straight out.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.760
And about half an hour into going straight out to see,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.440
it was all on the radio.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.240
What's that over there?

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.560
Oh, it's humpback whales and...

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.640
You could have listened, I couldn't believe it.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.840
I was so gutted.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.160
Spent the next six hours then on the roof of the Sulaire going around.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.600
I can't remember if I had other people with me or maybe just a few people.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.760
We weren't doing trips, we just went out looking basically.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.840
Six hours, I got sunburn, sunstroke, you name it.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.000
On the top of the roof, it was a boiling hot day.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.560
It was really rough at the end of it.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.560
I never saw a thing again.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.840
But we went scouting down towards Aberporth out to see.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.360
So that was a humpback whale and its calf.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.040
And Peter was saying that at that time of year,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.120
they do tend to go wandering around a bit randomly, turning up in random places.
