00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
There's that one and then there was the sightings I think it was the year after Sarah confirmed that

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:11.360
because we were actually on a trip when there was sightings down off Cardigan, Cardigan Estuary

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.400
I think one of the other boats Sarah saw something breach in the distance we went over

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:25.360
in that direction to see and it I think she sensed it wasn't possibly a dolphin but then

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.680
we sort of confirmed that when we got there there was nothing there and

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.640
minutes later I think it was Tony Barber on one of the other boats called me said I've just had a

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.280
thresher shark by the boat which is just a little way away so you know that could you know that's

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.000
probably it so yeah they're they're not unknown at all you know
