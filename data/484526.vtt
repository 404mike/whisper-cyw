The date today is Friday the 19th of December

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.040
and the venue for the interview is the Swicker office.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.720
Fionn, would you be kind enough to

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.960
spell your name in full

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.520
for posterity?

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:38.880
Fionn, C-A-M-P-B-E-L-D-A-V-I-E-S.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.480
Thank you very much indeed.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.480
So Fionn, how did you first get involved in Cardiff Carnival?

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.240
I was really young, I was probably about four or five years old

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.240
and it was my mum who got me involved

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.160
and initially I think she'd heard about it

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.680
and she must have seen it the previous year

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.720
and watched it and I was probably with her.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.240
I don't really remember the very beginnings of,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.440
you know, how we got there. I just remember doing the carnival.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.840
So my first carnival that I participated in,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.480
I don't remember what costume I was wearing.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.240
I don't, I just remember that the route used to be from,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.200
is it the Cattays Community Centre? And so I remember the Cattays Community Centre

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.040
and I remember what it used to look like inside

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.320
and you know, it'd have all these crazy big

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.880
structures hanging up from the ceiling and there'd be music playing outside,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.520
drumming and I just remember it was really weird. I thought it was weird when

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.720
I first went there. I just thought there's nothing I've ever seen like this

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.400
before in my whole life and literally every shade and size and

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.280
personality range of people all together in one building and I thought

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.720
this is bizarre. And yeah, it was amazing actually

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.680
because when you're so young and then you just see all these different types of

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.800
characters and people and all these different costumes and

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.960
there's all these different bright colours

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.720
and there's people making costumes, there's people putting on costumes and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.560
trying on costumes, there's also music and people drumming and people

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.120
trying things outside. It's a lot to take in for a child I

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.040
think and I remember from maybe a few years down the line

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.640
I went with a friend, obviously still with my mum

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.560
because I was probably what maybe eight or nine years old and I took a friend

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.080
and my friend freaked out and that's when I realised, okay this is not

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.400
not everyone can handle this. This is powerful juju.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.840
And I think because of my upbringing, because of my mum being an

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.600
artist and my mum being a dancer and also my father being a dancer

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.640
and we traveled a lot and being familiar with

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:07.040
street art and dance and music and costumes and crazy people in general.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.840
My mum used to have been taken around when she was

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.920
performing and would be in the dressing room

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.960
and artists are weird people, they're crazy

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.880
and so that is something that I was used to and I guess my friend

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.000
wasn't used to that kind of stuff and

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.680
I guess for a child as well if you've got people on stilts

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.760
and they're in crazy costumes and they're literally like

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:38.240
12 feet above adult size that's pretty scary and so for me

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.040
seeing my friend freak out was like a big sort of like wake-up call

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:50.240
I thought oh okay I get it now. Not everybody spends the summer this way.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.360
Yeah and so for quite a few years I think

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.880
we did the carnival and I remember one particular year more than any of the

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.840
others because it seems to be at that age it was a bit of a blur it was just

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.640
like oh I did carnival but it was one blur of a few years mixed together but

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.240
I do remember one particular year and it was the year that it rained

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.400
and we got massive like publicity as well because it rained and

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:23.440
like costumes being adapted on the day and I remember particularly our costume

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.920
that was supposed to look one way and then we ended up completely changing it

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.680
because there was something I think it was a plasticky fabric I

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.000
can't remember what the fabric was but it was plastic

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.640
and it was supposed to be on the body wrapped somewhere on the body we ended

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.840
up using that material and wrapping it on our heads and we ended up looking

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.640
sweeties and I remember just looking like sweet rappers and the reason why we did

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.560
that is so that we would not get wet but it actually ended up looking really good

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:58.000
and yeah and then I remember also another time was when it was the night

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.560
carnival and we finished by the museum and it was like I don't know what time it

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.800
was but I just remember being like oh my god I'm supposed to be in bed and it's

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.280
like really really really late and I've never been out this late before

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.400
and they had all these like amazing costumes and some of them had like

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.120
lights on them as well for the feature of the fact that it was in the evening

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.280
and I just remember one particular set of costumes that stood out for me that I'll

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.720
never forget was the skeleton costumes because they looked amazing they were

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:40.720
basically body suits with imagery of skeletons but then they were like glowing lights on them

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.560
and I don't know if it was neon glow in the dark or if it were actually else

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:54.160
led lights yeah and so yeah that image in my head will always be like a classic

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.400
carnival years memories that's one that comes straight to my mind and also just

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.640
because it's a spectacular thing to see like on the the the framing of the museum staircase

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:13.680
and having live percussion like on the stairs and then the actual costumes on the top part

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.760
of the entrance and you're just standing there from a distance and you're looking at it and

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.600
you're just thinking wow like that just looks amazing and obviously I was in the con I was in

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:31.120
the procession but then that that final kind of finish up it is it is spectacular that you

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:37.040
kind of forget you're in the procession yourself and you're just like oh my god and I think that's

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.400
probably a lot of the times I don't remember what I was wearing actually if you'd asked me oh what

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.800
what you know what did you wear each year you know when you're that age I don't have a clue

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.480
because I think I was always so fascinated by all the other costumes around me that I've totally

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:58.960
forgot what I was wearing and then yeah and then I didn't I stopped going I think and it was probably

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:06.160
to do with you know school projects and getting you know school became more academic and was doing

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.800
more projects you know outside of school and after school dance and things like that that

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:18.320
probably didn't go for maybe a few years and probably as well because I went away during that

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:24.880
time was a summer period like you do go on holiday but I think then when I came back

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:36.640
the carnival had moved to the pavilion in Butetown and that was again very very different

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:42.720
it was almost like a totally separate carnival to the first few ones that I'd been to when I was younger

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:50.080
and I think as well it was different because that time my mum was then working in it and she

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:59.440
was teaching dance and it used to be with Jane Bellamy and my mum and then I remember that being

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:04.560
very different again I think it changes a lot depending who's running you know the classes

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:14.240
who's running the music sessions you know who's leading the creative sector of it it changes

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:19.840
because each person has their personality and how they run things it's very different and I think

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:27.440
that also affects everything else so it gives a totally different vibe and so each person that

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:33.920
then is working on the carnival gives something different to the next person and the next person

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.560
the next person that comes and that's what I really like actually about the journey that

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:45.440
carnival's gone through is that we've seen all the different shades and colours of what people bring

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:54.240
to the process of being involved in carnival and so yeah I think when it's the first year or so or

00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:03.440
the first few years I remember one of my costumes very very specifically because I remember rehearsing

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:08.560
so much for the dance and I think it was probably also to do the fact that I had been doing dance

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.800
outside of school and that you know that at that point in my life I was kind of getting more

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:19.600
involved in dance I was a little bit older I was probably what was 11 no probably 9 10 that age

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:29.520
and it was the costume was like skyscrapers like building basically a building doesn't sound

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.360
amazing now I'm saying it but it was amazing it was like a backpack it was the first time that I

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.960
was wearing a backpack and it was a children's backpack so it wasn't huge but obviously when

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.920
you're that age and you've never worn a backpack before it is huge to you and you're like oh my

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:49.040
god it's heavy and how are we going to dance with this you know and then you look back at the photos

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.920
and you're like oh that was nothing what am I talking about but yeah it was it was a new

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:59.360
experience for me because it's dancing with a backpack is very different to just you know

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.640
freestyling on the street and doing what the hell you like and doing cartwheels and running up and

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.120
down the road you can't really do that when you've got a backpack and likewise you can't really just

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:13.600
be bumping into any old person because you've got to be spatially aware and so the choreography

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:19.200
that we've learnt it was all about you know being aware of each other because you know you're in a

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.720
group and and there's probably about 10 people with the same backpack so when you're doing turns

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.800
and things like that and you're traveling to the side to stay in line with the people next to you

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:34.960
and so there's all these kind of skills that I was learning and it's not really skills that you

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:40.480
would learn in the dance class because you don't wear backpacks like how often in your life do you

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:49.920
say yeah I wear a backpack yeah so it's very specific to carnival experience and yeah I just

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:58.000
remember loving it like that particular year I really really enjoyed because it felt

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.520
so full on I just remember Monday to Friday every day there was a session maybe it was an hour

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:12.160
or two hours with a break in between and you'd have your dance class and it was very structured

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.720
so you know most of the day you're kind of here and there kind of creating bits and bobs here

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:22.480
and there helping out you come and go but then there's a set hour that you know okay now we're

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:28.800
going to do some dancing and what's nice is that gradually throughout the weeks you start to see

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:34.320
the costumes come together and you might you know in one rehearsal you might think oh now the hats

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.560
are finished so we can dance with the hats you know and that's really exciting because it's like

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:43.920
oh the costume's almost ready and then you know the last week you can actually practice with the

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.960
backpacks and you realize oh I've been doing the turns and leg kicks like this but now we can't do

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.960
it like that because it's totally different when you've got a backpack and you know I can't do this

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.200
crazy whip that I was doing before now I've got to be a little bit more agile and make sure they

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.120
don't bump into the person next to me and so there's all these things that the process that

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:06.800
you go through from the first week to the second week to the third week is very different and

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:14.640
so that was that was the first maybe it could have been the second year maybe of being at the

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:22.240
pavilion and I remember a lot about being in the pavilion because the space the environment was

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:28.640
very different you had like field in the back where you could always go out and practice dancing

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:34.720
outside which I don't remember doing so much at Cattay's and I think that's just because it was

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:41.360
the main road right outside the building so that was different having space where you could actually

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:48.560
freely go out whenever you wanted and go over some dancing and there would be classes music

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.480
classes percussion that sometimes they would be in the room upstairs or sometimes they would be

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:57.760
outside depending on the weather and I think that really changes it completely because it

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:04.400
it's more related and suited to the actual day of the carnival because that is outdoors that is on

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:10.560
the road and you do have to travel and move forwards progressively it's not just you know

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:17.840
if you're dancing you're not just on the spot you are constantly moving forwards and so I think

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:24.160
it's one thing you notice and I think a lot of people notice and it's one thing people talk about

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:30.480
is when you're learning things even for the musicians when you're drumming it suddenly becomes

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.640
a totally different world when you've got to coordinate your hands and your legs at the same

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.760
time and you're thinking oh my god like this is just totally different I don't even think I can

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:44.560
do this but somehow you get there in the end you know because when you're practicing you're

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:48.320
sitting down or you're just standing still but then the day of the carnival you're actually

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:55.120
expected to walk for maybe 40 minutes you know and drumming continuously and obviously there are

00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:00.400
breaks and stops here and there but generally speaking it's a very different process and so

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:07.840
yeah I think it's the same with the dance that's something that you know is always exciting because

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:13.680
it's a challenge and it's and the other thing that's exciting is the element of surprise because

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:19.360
you can't actually predict what the day of the carnival is going to be like you can't predict

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:28.080
how your costume is going to be you can't predict you know how certain you know crowds at certain

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.960
points that you arrive are going to shock you or surprise you or put you off or you know the roads

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.400
are going to be really narrow at one point and then they're going to be really broad at another

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:43.440
point and how you respond to all those changes as you're going along is all about being in

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:50.720
in the mood like not in the mood but in the state of mind and staying in that place of

00:14:51.600 --> 00:15:00.320
complete commitment to just enjoying carnival like you have to just go with it and I think it's

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:05.760
probably not suited to people who like to know how things are going to go because you know that's why

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.760
maybe sometimes people do get a bit pissed off during carnival because they think oh well you

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.800
know I can't dance now because the road's narrow and you know and they get a bit stressed and

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.360
you know it's like listen you just got to go with that yeah you got to brush it off it's all part

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:27.600
of the experience but I think for me growing up and being young and going through it from a young

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:36.320
age and till I'm the age that I am now I've been able to kind of adapt and understand all those

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:42.240
processes and the experiences that I've had have taught me lots of different things you know when

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:50.000
there was a year that I kind of put a lot of I think I was probably maybe 14, 15 I put a lot of

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:55.920
effort into not that I hadn't previously but this particular year I put a lot of effort into my own

00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:01.760
costume because I think previously you kind of sometimes you don't know what costume you're

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:07.840
going to wear until the last week but you're still there helping out and it was this year that I knew

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.480
I was like right this is a costume I'm going to have and I'm going to make sure that mine's the

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:18.880
best and you know I'm going to spend every day like putting all my sequins on it and blah blah blah

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:28.160
and you have a particular expectation or particular view of how it's going to turn out

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.520
and how it's going to look on you even though you haven't even tried it out yet because you're still

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.960
putting it together but you're still like oh it's yeah it's going to look like this and it's going

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:39.600
to fit like this and this is how it's going to go and then the last week comes and you're thinking

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.360
oh my god it's not it's not actually coming together how I wanted it to and it's not

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:47.200
fitting on me how I wanted it to I wanted to be a little bit shorter here and a little bit longer

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:52.720
there and you know and the hat is falling every time I dance it's falling down drooping over my

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:58.720
face and you know and all these things are part of the experience but you know when you're just

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:04.880
realizing those things it becomes a bit of a stressy moment and you're thinking ah no it was

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:11.840
supposed to be perfect and I think when you hold on to those things that's when you have a difficult

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:19.360
time because that was probably one of the years I did was very frustrated because you know obviously

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:25.200
if you're going to be dancing and and walking for 40 minutes your costume isn't going to stay sitting

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.800
perfectly on you for the whole time and I think people who don't know about carnival who are not

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:37.680
experienced they don't know these things and you know sometimes it sounds silly because you you you

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:42.160
kind of after the experience you think oh my god I was so stupid like why did I think that was

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:49.280
going to be like that obviously not you know and the same when you're designing a backpack you know

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:53.760
you have an idea or you have an image of yeah it's going to look like this and it's going to fit like

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:58.640
that but when it comes to actually the logic of it and you know how much weight you've got on the

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.840
left and how much weight you've got on the right and how structurally how equal and how balanced it

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:09.120
is if it's a if it's a shape that you think oh my god it's a really unique shape it's going to look

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:14.000
really interesting but the actual statistics of it is that there's more weight on the left than

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.720
there is on the right obviously after 20 minutes of walking with more weight on the left and the

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.560
right you're obviously going to have a backache when the breeze comes it's obviously going to

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.320
you know trip you up and make you fall to one side than the other and you're going to really

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:33.520
struggle with it and you know the kind of knowledge that I have now I can apply that and I can at least

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:38.640
know that okay yes this year I'm being ambitious and this year yeah I'm going to have a really bad

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:44.480
left side of my back but I want to create this shape and this is you know the costume that I

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:52.400
want to make or I would ideally like to wear this costume but I'm aware that it's going to be tricky

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:57.440
or I'm aware that yeah it's not going to be that easy or that comfortable to wear but when you're

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:04.880
younger you don't know all these things and so there have been you know a year one one year here

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:11.520
one year there like in the summer where it hasn't been that great or I haven't enjoyed it because

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:17.040
I've had those expectations and I haven't achieved those expectations because I didn't think it

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:22.080
through properly and you know there's been I remember that that the year that I'm talking

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:28.800
about was it was a skirt a samba skirt that I had and the beads just fell off because the way I'd

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:38.560
made it you know it wasn't made with the knowledge that you know maybe someone who's done it a few

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:43.840
years who's been making samba style costume because there's lots of different styles of

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:50.080
costumes you can make there's lots of different ways of making skirts or making trousers or making

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:56.800
tops and this this style that I was going for you know the way that you would make it

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:03.680
you know it wasn't the approach that I was going for it was more of a visual so I was looking at

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:08.720
it thinking this is going to look good but I wasn't actually aware of how it's made how is

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:13.920
that going to last what's the durability of it and I think that's something when you have experience

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:19.440
that's all all those kind of elements have to take place when you make a costume you have to

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:24.800
think about is it is it durable more longer than 30 minutes longer than 40 minutes is going to last

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:30.240
is it going to last rain is it going to last wind is it going to last through dancing because some

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.320
costumes you can wear if you're just walking but if you start dancing in it it starts to slowly

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:40.000
fall apart you know and so that's another thing you have to bear in mind and I guess as well if

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.840
I was making costume purely for myself one of the things that I have to take into consideration

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:51.360
which maybe not everyone else does but because I know that I dance my pants off when the carnival

00:20:51.360 --> 00:21:03.280
comes I know that I literally go all out 100% I don't hold back and so for me I have to consider

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:07.760
I have to do a little test run I have to put the costume on and literally jump around like crazy

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.200
and be like okay is it going to fall off because this is probably what I'll do on the day of the

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.280
carnival you know when the music starts playing and when you know the whistles start blowing

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:21.360
everyone's there and the energy really rises I'm not going to be like oh yeah just doing a sidestep

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:25.680
you know in a few turns here no I'm going crazy so I need to make sure that my costume is going

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:32.880
to be able to last my dancing and so yeah I guess over the years these are things that I've come to

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:40.880
learn and it's been really good for me because it's things that I can apply to other things as

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:50.080
well I think carnival has taught me a lot of skills a lot of teamwork skills a lot of creative

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:59.040
skills you know working with different materials and also teaching skills because even when I wasn't

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.880
you know part of the team even when I wasn't working even when I was just a child and I was

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:08.640
just participating or as a teenager whatever you know you're still having to to work with a group

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:13.600
of people and you're still having to dance with a group of people and sometimes you have to help

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:20.080
each other out because you some people can't make every day some people can only make once a week

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:26.000
and you want to make sure that you look great as a group when the day the carnival comes so it's

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.360
also about helping each other out and you know if that person only comes on a Tuesday and you know

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:35.040
that oh she's only going to come next Tuesday well that next Tuesday I'm going to make sure

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:40.000
that even though the teacher's delivering the exercises and delivering the the steps

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:44.560
but you're also there to help that person as well and if you know that you can contribute and you

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:49.120
know that oh well I know how to break this step down you know it goes like this and blah blah blah

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.520
and in it you know likewise if you know that you're going to see that person outside of carnival and

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:57.760
you're not you might see them in town or you know that you're it's one of your friends and you're

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:02.640
going to meet them on the weekend to have a cup of tea or whatever you know you're still going to make

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:08.560
that effort to to talk about well you know carnival's next weekend so let's try and go

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:14.480
over it really quickly and you know get it together and it's all about teamwork even if you're not

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:21.520
part of even if you're not a professional working for the carnival and you're still just a member

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:28.000
of public and I think that's what's really nice as well being on the other side when I have been

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:33.040
working as a professional in the carnival and you see the members of public working together as a

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:38.640
team and you see you know members of public who you know they may not have great experience in

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:45.760
in artistry or or you know making things and crafting but they still are able to help each

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:51.040
other and oh well you know I was using a biro pen to stick the sequins down you know because that

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:54.640
you know helps to make sure I don't burn my fingers and to someone who's never used a

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:58.640
glue gun before and they've just burnt themselves and it's like you know all these little they might

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:03.920
sound silly but they are still tricks to the trade and you know little things that help when you're

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:11.600
making things and and especially when you see children doing that and they you know the way

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:15.200
that children communicate is really fascinating because they always talk like they're little

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:20.480
adults you know but then you're looking at them you know oh they're so cute and she's like oh yes

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:24.320
well you know you have to make sure that when you're stapling it you know that you do you hold it

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:32.880
here and you know and it's just so cute because it it's really a very positive environment and

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.480
you see a lot of people change over the you know even though it's only three weeks and it's not

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:44.080
that long you see a lot of people change over those three weeks and especially people who've never

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:50.320
been before and you know they might have come the first week and they're very unsure and they're not

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:57.200
you know they're doubtful of whether they want to do it or not and they don't really ask questions

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:01.520
because they don't really they don't want to bother you and but they still don't know what they're

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:05.200
doing how to make you know what what are they cutting out they don't know how to do it but

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.880
they're sitting there and you know that oh they're a bit unsure so you go and talk to them and you

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:13.520
encourage them and you say oh you know don't worry you can do this and you have your 10 minute break

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:17.920
and you can come back whenever you want and blah blah blah and gradually then the second week they

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.600
come back and they're a bit more familiar and they they actually know what they're doing so that

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.760
you see them kind of going up and getting their own things and you know they're a little bit more

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.920
confident and then they do come up and ask you know oh i wanted to do this but i was thinking

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:34.720
this might look better and and you start to see that they then offer their own opinions of you

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.800
know how they want to make the costume and that's also nice as well because some people come up with

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:44.960
really good ideas and they commit themselves to those ideas as well which is really nice

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:52.880
to see sometimes when someone comes and they actually end up making their own their own

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:59.120
costume and you know it's all great when someone's all talk but you sometimes you just don't know

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:03.200
because you don't know that person you don't know if they've got experience you don't know

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:07.280
how often they've done things like this so sometimes someone come and go oh yeah yeah i'm

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.160
gonna make this costume i'm gonna do this and blah blah and you're kind of nodding your head

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:17.200
yes okay okay let's see you know but it's really nice when you get to the last week and that person

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:22.400
has actually achieved that and you go oh my god like it's not that i wasn't expecting much of you

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:29.440
but it's that actually you've gone on your own journey and you've given yourself your own

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:37.280
goals and achievements and you've structured your time and you've been organized with it and

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:45.040
that's really really important i think when you see people do that because it also it it lets other

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:51.680
people see that as well because other people kind of go oh but she made that costume herself wow and

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:55.680
they've seen all the hard work that that person's put into it and it makes them think and they go

00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:00.720
wow well i was just coming in monday once a week and you know could have come in a bit more but

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.720
now it makes me feel like i should be coming in more and you know it makes me want to actually

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:11.680
make my own costume and that's i think great because it actually boosts everyone else up

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:19.760
and it brings everyone on a on a higher level and i think that's what's really good about carnival

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:26.160
is that you're always you're never satisfied with you know just what you can get first chance

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:31.760
there's always a well now i'm going to improve it this much more or now that the second week's gone

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.680
and i've made my costumes finished but you know what i'm still not satisfied i want to make it

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:42.240
even better and it's always those people that you're watching on the sides that make you kind of

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:47.600
reflect on yourself about those things because someone in that room is always going to be pushing

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.360
to the next level and that's what brings everyone else up to push the next level and i think that's

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:59.760
what's what's really great about carnival but yeah i think later on as i going back to you know my

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:08.080
experiences carnival later on when i was a little bit older i started to then you know do my own

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:15.360
things so when i was about six 16 17 that's when i kind of you know i still was you know just coming

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:24.720
along every few days a week and my mum was still working on the carnival and you know we'd kind of

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:31.920
me and my mum that's that's another conversation but you know it's it's it's funny kind of

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.480
being a child and your mum's taking you along and then you start to become a little bit more

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:42.400
independent and your mum's working on the carnival and it's this kind of thing of well fion you know

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:47.120
you should be coming in and you know you need to do this and make sure that you go to the rehearsal

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:56.240
and you're like yes yes mum yes mum and then you know it changes because then it's it's a different

00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:02.160
story when you're working on the carnival and your mom's working on the carnival and it's just it's

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:11.120
totally different but um i'll talk about that later but going back to going back to you know

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:17.200
participating in the carnival at that age you know i was more independent so i remember being

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:22.720
a little bit rebellious sometimes and you know the the style of the costume was this and i was like

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:30.880
yeah i like that but i want to do it like this you know and this this kind of like subtle quiet

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:37.440
rebellious rebelliousness coming out you know where i remember one year i cut my skirt much shorter

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:43.840
than it was supposed to be and it was quite funny actually because my mum was like fion what are

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:49.120
you doing this is not how the costume's supposed to be you're not allowed to do that and i guess

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:56.320
as well when you when your parent is a member of the staff and you've got friends and their parents

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:03.280
aren't so it's almost like it's almost like you're on a pedestal a bit i guess because they look up to

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:08.960
you and whatever you do they copy and so that was the problem with that year and that's why i got

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:13.440
really told off about it was because i cut my skirt because i thought well you know i'm going

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:20.080
to do what i want to do and i cut my skirt a lot shorter and turned up and all the other girls had

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:24.640
really long skirts and they looked at me and they're like why is your skirt really short and i was

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:31.200
like i just thought it looked better and then literally within the next 20 minutes all these

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:36.240
four other girls had also cut their skirts really short and then someone came along and was like

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:42.720
what is going on that's a waste of fabric you know and it's all these things that you don't consider

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:47.040
because you're kind of being absent-minded about oh well you know i want to look the best and

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.960
you know and you don't think about all these other things because you know you're still

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:55.200
essentially you're still just a kid you know turning up and just participating in this happy

00:30:55.280 --> 00:31:02.320
free-go-lucky carnival experience but yeah that's that's i remember that year kind of

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:08.080
i guess stepping out a little bit and being a little bit more independent and then the year

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:14.000
after that you know it wasn't like that then because i thought oh yeah i'm older now i need

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:21.360
to be more responsible and yes people are gonna follow me if i do something some you know other

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:27.040
people are going to do the same so that means i can't you know for example i can't be

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:35.920
alternating my costume the way that you know i might want to um because then that means that

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:40.880
everyone else is allowed to do the same and then where do you where do you leave where do you go

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:45.040
with that if everyone starts doing their own changes to their own costumes then you don't

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:52.320
have a structure anymore so then you have to you start thinking on the bigger picture and the and

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:59.840
the the perspective of how and the knock-on effect of everything else it's not just about you anymore

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:06.320
and that's also something that is really important about carnival it's never just about you and

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:12.080
i guess you have to go through that experience to realize that because sometimes people do turn up

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:19.360
and they do go well i want this costume and i this and i that and you know eventually they realize

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:24.320
that well actually you don't have that much fun when it's just about you you know with the day of

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:29.040
the carnival yeah you might have the best costume or you might have chosen the best costume and you

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:34.720
might be with the best band and you might be in the best location of the carnival but then it's

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:39.040
still you're still by yourself and then it's like are you having a great time now that you've got

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:44.320
your best costume and you're with the best band and does that actually give you the opportunity to

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:49.600
have the greatest carnival year no it doesn't because it is about being with everyone else

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:55.920
and sometimes i've had the greatest experience even when i'm in a costume that i really don't like

00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:00.320
and it's because you have to kind of forget about the superficial things because it's not about the

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:05.280
superficial things even though we are making costumes that look fantastic it's not always

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:10.240
about looking fantastic it's also about being able to engage with everyone around you and being

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:16.320
able to engage on all levels because you do get all types of people coming in and doing carnival

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:23.200
you get people with special needs you get people with learning disabilities you get people with

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:30.880
social inadequacies or you know people who have issues at home and so they're not as confident

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:36.640
you get people who are extremely confident and love to talk about all the things they're doing

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:42.960
and bring it to the carnival as well and you get people who are extremely skilled and can actually

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:47.680
really help in the process even though they're not part of the team you also get people who've

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:53.360
never done anything like this before and they can't dance and they can't you know play drums here and

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:57.120
there but they still get involved and they still try really hard and eventually they do actually

00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:03.200
get something out of it and it's about giving everyone the opportunity to engage with each other

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:12.160
so yeah i think over the years that is what i've come to realise that's the fundamental about

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:20.240
carnival it's really about connecting with lots of different types of people and you know when i

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:27.280
started to work in the carnival that's something that really comes to play because you have to be

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:33.200
able to communicate with all different types of people you know you have to be able to communicate

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:41.280
with people who aren't that fortunate and for them carnival is amazing and you know they kind of want

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:46.160
to take everything that they can at first opportunity and they and you know thinking oh

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:51.600
my god everything's free let's just make the most of it you know i mean but then at the same time

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.520
you're talking to people who've done it for years and they're like oh yeah it's nothing to me you

00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:01.440
know it's just you know the usual you know and it's like it's a very different head space when

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:06.080
you you're literally in one minute you're talking to someone who's got special needs and literally

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:10.720
two seconds later someone else is coming to you who's got loads of experience who's got loads of

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:14.080
ideas and they're like oh i wanted to do this but then i want to do that and then you know and you're

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:18.960
like oh my god like i've just been trying to get someone who doesn't want to do anything at all

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.200
trying to get them to do at least one thing and then i'm trying to get someone else to not do

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.400
everything that they want to do because there's too many ideas but i'm trying to get them to focus

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:31.920
on one thing you know so it's quite broad when you're working in the carnival it's a very broad

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:40.320
place to be and especially for me i i have experienced in a few different things you know

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:47.280
so i'm experienced as a dancer but that's not just my forte because i love making things i love

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:54.640
crafting and i love you know the the sequining and and um that's it called a fiber pole making

00:35:54.640 --> 00:36:04.240
fiber pole and making the infrastructures for backpacks and um i do so occasionally i'm not

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:10.800
one for sewing that much i've got to say it's probably not the greatest but you know when

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:14.880
you've only got two people on the sewing machine and you've got about 50 costumes that need sewing

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:19.280
yes you have to unfortunately have to get the people who aren't that great at sewing to help

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:26.640
along and that was me um so i've been you know involved in all the different aspects and

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:32.400
to the extent as well of playing drums and getting involved with the percussion

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:41.360
and so for me it's really satisfying because a lot of other opportunities that i have they're always

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:49.840
one or the other i'm either doing music or i'm doing art or i'm doing dance whether it's teaching

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:56.000
or performing whatever it's always one form and that's what i actually really love about carnival

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.680
it's a unique environment to work in because you're constantly going backwards and forwards

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:09.120
from all those different elements um you know i could have one hour where i'm dancing and literally

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:14.160
as soon as i've finished teaching dance i go back to making my backpack again you know and it's

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:22.080
very refreshing for me um and so that's the other side of it you know from being

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:29.120
participating in it and then working in the carnival is is a different thing altogether

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:35.600
because you have the responsibilities and you have to organize and you have to be um what do you call

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:43.760
it you have to be able to go from one thing to the other whereas when you're participating

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:48.560
i remember when i was you know when i was a kid i actually didn't do that much making especially

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:52.800
when you're a child you want loads of energy you literally sit down for 20 minutes and you do your

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.640
cutting and you're like okay i'm bored you know and then you want to just dance for the rest of

00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:02.160
the day so for me when i was a kid i didn't do that much craft making actually i would maybe do

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:07.120
bits and bobs here and there but i was mainly loving the dancing and you know especially when

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:12.000
as soon as music was playing that was it i was up and dancing so i remember when i was a child that

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.040
was mainly an environment where i could just dance and no one would be like oh she's weird

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:20.000
you know because obviously if i'm in school and i just start dancing people are going to be like

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:26.080
yeah she's a weirdo but in carnival you know it was always normal it was always acceptable to just

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:33.280
go and just do whatever and pick up a drum and play it or you know paint on the wall so yeah

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:39.360
for me that's the the spectrum from being participating in it and working in it

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:46.320
it's very different but at the same time it's the same so yeah

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:53.440
can i just say that is one of the most eloquent accounts of a carnival journey i've ever heard

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:59.840
in my professional career uh fionn bless you and thank you very much indeed
