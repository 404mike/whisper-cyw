00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Mistletoe hung from the gas brackets in all of the front parlors.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
There were sherry and walnuts and bottled beer and crackers by the dessert screens.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And cats in their furabouts watched the fires.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And the high-heaped fire spat, all ready for the chestnuts and the mulling pokers.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Some few large men sat in the front parlors without their collars.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Uncles almost certainly trying their new cigars, holding them out judiciously at arm's length,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000
returning them to their mouths, coughing, then holding them out again as though waiting for an explosion.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And some few small aunts, not wanted in the kitchen, not anywhere else for that matter,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.000
sat on the very edges of their chairs, poised and brittle, afraid to break like faded cups and saucers.
