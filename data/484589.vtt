00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.040
Before we start, Michelle would you be kind enough to spell your name in full for the record?

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.320
Okay it's M-I-C-H-E-L-E-L-E-A-S-K.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.680
Thank you very much indeed.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:39.600
Going back to summers to Cardiff 2014, it was the 25th anniversary Cardiff Carnival

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.560
and you and your lovely daughter Rosie took part for the first time. What was it like?

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.320
It was fantastic. We had a great day.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.760
We did get very wet because it did rain unfortunately.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.760
However we had great fun and everybody in the streets were cheering us on which was great

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.360
because they were all standing there getting wet too but it still went very well.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.520
Of course your carnival story starts with a visit to the carnival camp

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.520
which was at Fitz Allen High School.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.240
So you got there, what happened next?

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.840
Well we went in, we were very much welcomed by the staff.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:25.440
We were asked what category we wanted to be in and my daughter chose a category where a friend was

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.520
when they were making water. It was to do with water and the sea and so we made costumes of

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:40.240
animals and things and our costumes were very much decorated. It's sea sort of themed.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.520
Were you fish is that right?

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.560
We were kind of fish.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.840
We made a good effort to be fish like.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.960
Or mermaids maybe.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.240
Did you have fish like? What was your face paint like on the braid?

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.680
Oh it was lovely. We were all kind of bluish with very blue and turquoisey sparkly bits.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.080
So we were all very different faces but all with the same colours.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.640
Blended in and looked very well together.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.440
It sounds smashing. Can you remember what music you could hear on the carnival parade?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.560
Yeah it was all the drums and the carnival atmosphere really and you need that to dance

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.160
and get your little routines going and once you're all doing it together and you can hear the drums

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.760
of the band. I can't remember what they were called.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.800
That's samba drumming.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.840
Samba drumming yeah.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.200
So many different bands.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.960
Yeah they were great and without that it would have been a lot harder but

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.040
you know it really brings the atmosphere together.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.760
That sounds wonderful. Rosie, very bright kid. I always think of her in musical terms

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.880
because I know she plays the keyboard and indeed sings in the choir.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.320
How does she take to the actual making which is a different art form as well?

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.000
Yeah she enjoys that a lot.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.160
Yeah so sticking doesn't bother her?

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.440
No she likes sewing as well which I'm really rubbish at.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:12.480
Yeah but yeah so she's well into that always making things anyway so she's very creative.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.840
Yeah she enjoys the making.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.120
Obviously gets it from her mother.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.840
Well lovely to hear about your carnival experiences and I think I'm right in saying that

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.160
having been in that parade you've joined us Swicker on other occasions including the

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.280
grandly named National St David's Day Parade.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.760
Oh that's the best yeah that's great we love that.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.480
We like dressing up as dragons and parading on St David's Day. I'm gonna miss that.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.200
You had headpieces didn't you?

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.560
Yeah we had big wings.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.320
Right right right did the wind catch you at all?

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.720
No I caught a few people in the crowd.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.320
Pashed a few heads with my wings but yeah it was all okay.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.240
Their lawyers didn't get in touch.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.520
Nobody was fine.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.600
No they didn't get in touch that's fantastic.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.200
Michelle thank you so much for telling us about what it was like to be there at Carnival Number 25.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.400
It was fantastic experience and yeah it's going to be a shame it's not happening again.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.160
Thank you very much indeed bless you.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.800
Thank you.
