00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
Oh, massively. I mean, certainly the mackerel, used to hand line for mackerel,

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:11.040
and that has changed massively. That was in the late 70s, early 80s. And we go out,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:21.200
three men on a boat, hand lining, and it'd be nothing for us to catch, you know, maybe a

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:30.160
hundred dozen per man on the boat that morning, and go in and, you know, land by eight, nine o'clock

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.800
in the morning. Literally the deck, it'd be quite, it's quite amazing. We'd block the scuppers with

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.800
little slides, we'd slip bits of timber into the scuppers to block so they didn't all

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.360
pour out the scuppers. And you'd literally have to shuffle around deck through all the fish,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.760
otherwise you'd be treading on them. And the deck would just be covered in a sea of,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.840
you know, that deep, full of mackerel, and then you'd box them,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.640
counting them. So it was, I think it was 10 dozen boxes, I remember. And you'd land them,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.480
and they'd land them ashore, and they'd go then to the carriers. The carriers would all be there,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.120
and then Morris House and Vans, or the Maxis, or whatever. Maxis were ideal, because you just

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.280
fit, fish boxes would fit perfectly in the back of an Austin Maxi. Go off driving around,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:23.440
on their rounds, selling them. So that was, that has been, that has absolutely been transformed,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.840
that's one transformation I've seen very, very much so.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.040
Because it's not like that now.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.600
Oh, nothing like, nothing like. And that's been devastating, not by hand lining for mackerel,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.360
but by huge factory ships off Scotland, who literally can, you know, they can,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.240
they can sort of fill the boat in one haul, they can scoop up, you know,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.560
tons and thousands of tons of mackerel in one go. So that fish has been devastating.
