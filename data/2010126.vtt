Mr. Kanhai Chatterjee, he has been one of the senior committee members for a long long time

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and has actually been involved in the Welsh Puja Committee for over 30 years, probably.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So, Kanhai, can you say how and when you got involved in Durga Puja and festival?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.000
When I first came to Portcombe, after I got married in 1975, obvious reasons that we are looking for somewhere

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
where the puja is going to take place and that's how we got involved in 1975.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So, you were actually involved in the first year or two of puja starting because Durga Puja started in 1974, I think, in somebody's house.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Yes, after one year we started.
