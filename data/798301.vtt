00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
I'd say probably my favourite Welsh variety I've got on the orchard is a variety called

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:11.040
Frederick. It's an old Monmouthshire cider apple. The apples are very, very small actually.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.480
Some of them are about a golf ball size and they've got a very dark kind of skin on them.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.760
It's all mottled and cracked. Really interesting character for a looking fruit and the trees

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.320
themselves are very wild. They kind of branch, fork a lot. When you look into a Frederick

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.040
tree you can easily tell it because you can see hundreds of forks in the branches. It's

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.800
quite a vigorous variety and it does produce a good crop of these little apples that are

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.160
an absolute pain to pick. The reason everyone does pick them is it's regarded as a vintage

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.200
cider apple variety. When we say vintage what we actually mean is it can make good cider

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.440
on its own. Most ciders blend it and so you take a blend of several varieties to get it

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.520
but some of the varieties are called vintage and all that basically means is it's good enough on

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.320
its own. So Frederick's one of those. It's called a full sharp and what that means is it's a very

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.640
acidic apple. It's got a very sharp, you know, appley taste to it. It also does have some tannins

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.680
in there which are the kind of dry and bitter characteristics you get. When you make single

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.720
variety cider out of it, I mean these days it's probably not to the commercial taste. It's a bit

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.800
too sharp. So these days you generally do blend it in but it's an interesting cider. It will ferment

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:39.320
to produce a kind of sharp fruity rich product with nice interesting flavours. I mean historically

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.120
as well the variety has also been used for making crabapple jelly. It has enough pectin in there

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.800
to make the jelly and so that's one of the other uses it's used for as well. I guess the other

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.280
things to say about it is quite often the flesh is quite pink in it so when you press it you get

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.360
a pink juice out of there. Sadly that doesn't carry through to the cider. It oxidises out but

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.920
it's one of the things you look at and you get a nice pink juice from it but it's a fun variety.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.520
It's a bit of an odd one to prune given its tree shape but yeah I really like it. I haven't done

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.560
single variety this year because as I said it's a bit too sharp for the modern palette. I use it

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:25.840
extensively in my May Day, my festival sweet cider and that cider, yeah it's got about say

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.720
three parts Frederick to one part bittersweet. That's the kind of blend so it is quite sharp

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.000
and appley and I serve it sweet as well and it works like that I'd say. At the moment I'm making

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.800
up my sunshine cider and I'm bagging that up then I'm pasteurising the bags and boxing them

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.040
and labelling up all ready to go then. Cider is obviously a live natural product when you ferment

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.360
it in big barrels and it's full of all kinds of different wild yeasts and bacterias and you know

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.880
it's fine and stable as it is but the modern taste of the consumer is basically they want it sweet and

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.200
so you have to sweeten it. You can either do it with a natural sugar like I use or you could use

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.480
artificial sweetener which I don't believe in. So you need to do something and hence you have to

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.000
pasteurise it. So that's basically today's job. After I pasteurise them in the boxes, in the old

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.160
days you know you start draining the barrel you get a big air space on the top and it'll be off

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:33.040
within five days and when I started running cider bars with camera and making cider you know over a

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.440
decade ago it's a clean and nicer product. You can guarantee when it goes to someone I know it's

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.560
going to be good. It's basically what modern industry demands. Well I guess two favourite

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.560
parts is one you're outside. You know when you're working in the orchard you're pruning,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.560
you're cutting, you're outside in the fresh air and like I say I love that. I've worked in

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.480
office for about 15 years sitting there and I can't stand it. I love being outside. The best,

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.400
you know that's probably one of the best bits is being outside and wandering around and the other

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.520
bit is when you're like somewhere at a show and you're selling it to the customer and they like

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.320
it and they appreciate it there's no better feeling to think I've made this product and

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.440
somebody's really happy with it. You know that's wonderful you know you can't pay for that. That's

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.840
brilliant.
