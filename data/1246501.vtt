00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So what are your feelings on Valentine's Day?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I like it.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What do you like about it?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I like treating a guy to a card or giving him some chocolate or something like that.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But I like people who can treat people as well in the same way.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So what was the best Valentine's gift you've ever had?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Off a dog.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
A real dog?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Not only a dog.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Oh good.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It's a cuddly toy, is it?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Yeah.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
That's a nice one.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Mm-hmm. What's the best thing you've bought for somebody?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I just needed something stupid.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Social workers taught me.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I was in a police at the time.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I was going out with this guy in London and they found out he was...

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Has he done something very bad?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Yeah.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Right.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Okay.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
If you know...

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And the other policeman found out that he'd done something very bad.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
No, other policemen.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Myself, social workers.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Right. Okay.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And I was going down to the nearby, there was a nearby Valentine's Day.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Mm-hmm.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And I was going down there, over to London's Day down there.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Right.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And they told me and I thinking, no, wait, I'll see.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So you didn't go in the end?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I didn't go and I dumped him.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Mm-hmm. So is it near miss there?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Yeah.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Right.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So you were gonna go and spend the night in a hotel or his place?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
His place.
