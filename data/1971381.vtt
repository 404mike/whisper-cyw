00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840
Well, back then in the first season, it was surprise and amazement because no other port

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.840
does it.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.920
Back then, we were the only port doing it.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.760
So it was complete amazement and surprise.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.880
And especially with the smaller ships, which tend to be American, so obviously customer

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.000
service to them is huge.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.520
They couldn't believe that we would all stand out on the port in the all weathers because

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.520
we were there in all weathers just to say hi to them, just to welcome them to the, you

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.840
know, because we at that point, it was literally they came off the boat.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.200
We said hi, maybe had a little chat with some of them.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.280
They'd get on the coach and go somewhere else.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.440
And then when they came back from the coach, on the coach, we'd be there and how was your

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.520
day and have a Welsh cake and bye, thanks for coming.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.280
And they really couldn't get their heads around that we would just be happy to do it.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.920
Now we have a reputation.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.480
People come out on the decks as they're coming into port because word spreads they know they're

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.320
going to get the fish girl friendly faces, award winning fish girl friendly faces.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.840
So they come out on the decks to see us.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.200
They come on.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:25.000
We have a crew come off the ship purely to meet us because all the crews know about fish

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.480
God by welcome now and the fish got friendly faces.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.840
And the main thing said all round is you never get a better welcome than you do at fish

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.160
God.
