Hi this is Mick Plaskin at Elan Valley Link and I'm here with Brett Creed and

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.320
we're going to have a discussion about your reasons for being here etc. So

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.240
where have you come from? Petworth in West Sussex. Okay and when did you

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.700
actually arrive? Yesterday. Okay what have you seen so far? Anything of interest?

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:34.460
Well lots of things, lots of beautiful countryside. Okay. We've driven up from

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.260
Sussex, we came across and then went up into Monmouthshire and then from

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:47.100
Monmouthshire across to the Glenuska State and near Crickhowell and then from

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:55.460
there up to Raida. Okay. We camped last night at Woodhouse Farm in Raida and

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.060
someone at the campsite mentioned that we're now off towards Aberystwyth or

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.060
towards the west coast so someone said oh you need to take the mountain road to

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.380
Aberystwyth and then we saw the dam signs so we thought we'd come up this

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.380
way as well. Excellent choice. So we didn't know this was here but we expected in all

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.580
this spectacular scenery to see spectacular things and this definitely is

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.980
a spectacular spot. Okay so for what you've just said did you do any research before you came here?

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.180
No, only with campsites. We sort of you know wanted to head to the middle of

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.460
Wales rather than just go straight to the coast. Okay. Check out the sites and

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.420
the valleys and whatever and that's what we've done. Okay. On what limited things

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.820
you've seen so far can you see any room for improvement? No, not at all. Not at all.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.920
I don't think so. I mean how can you improve upon this really? The one thing

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.660
my colleague said was well it would be great if there was a footpath across the

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.000
top of the dam or somehow you could walk across the top of the dam and get a real

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.080
view of it but apart from that apart from having a Lancaster fly over every

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.400
day I can't see how it can be improved. We have a few. We have quite a few around here. Oh wow fantastic.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:15.600
So what are you going to plan to see next? We're going to see the sea next. Right.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.120
In Aberystwyth? Yeah well no probably south New Quay. Okay. We're going over that way.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:28.760
Have you been to the visitor centre at all? No I haven't. Okay. So who have you

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.520
actually come with? Just friends. Friends? Yeah. Okay. Would you consider coming here

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.160
again? Oh very much so. Yeah. Would that be in the near future? Possibly next year.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.560
Okay. Yeah. It's always nice to see. Indeed. Do you think that coming here

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.840
Monday to Friday is any different to weekends? I would say that we're the sort

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.440
of people that like to, would love it or like it, prefer it when we feel like

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.160
we're the only people in the world as it were. So I would definitely say that

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.040
midweek is a better and probably less busy time to visit such sites. Okay. And

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.040
how are you finding the roads around here? Fine. Yeah absolutely fine. Good. Yeah.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.160
Okay well thank you very much for that. No it's all right. It's a pleasure. Thank you.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.320
We were going to carry on, sorry, we were going to carry on. Interview terminated.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.560
Okay. Thank you. Or even ended.
