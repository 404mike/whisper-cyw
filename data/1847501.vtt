00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Today is the 6th of November 2019 this is Dr. Adiola D'Huez. Can you say your full name for the recording?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
My name is Gwendolyn Hester, Gwendolyn Jemima Hester.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Jemima? Yeah. And where were you born?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I was actually born in St. Kitts, St. Kitts the Caribbean.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What is your birthdate?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Oh, I was born in May.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In May. What year?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I'm over 21.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Okay, okay. And what were your parents' names?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
My father's Alexander Brody.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And my mother's name was Leonora.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Her maiden name you want, isn't it?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You could say Brody.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Oh, Leonora Brody.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And what did your mom do?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Oh, my mom worked as a nurse.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
In St. Kitts?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
No, here in Britain.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Okay, and what did your father do?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
He worked for Super Oil Seal, here in Britain, until he retired.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Okay, wow.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Okay, so...

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
That was his only job, his first and ever job.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Wow, that's a long time. So he came straight to Cardiff when he came over?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Yes, when they came over, they got a job straight away.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Like a friend of mine, when she first came into Newport, she saw all these chimneys.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
She thought, oh, they're no sort of jobs.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
She thought all the chimneys are streets full of oil factories.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
She didn't realize the factories looked like a fireplace.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
To keep them warm, she thought they were all factories.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
What do you remember about St. Kitts?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
All I remember about St. Kitts is grapes.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
With these grapes, the black grapes, the way...

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I've got a sister in St. Kitts now, and I asked her about them.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And she said, they're called sea grapes.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
They're only grown by the sea. Do you know what I mean?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I don't have to taste one.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
That's the only thing I remember, is the sea grapes.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Okay, so you were very young when you came over here.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
How old were you when you came over?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Oh, well, I started, like I said, in junior school.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So how old were you? About five?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
How old were you when you came over to the UK from St. Kitts?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Do you remember? No.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Okay. Do you remember the journey coming over?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Not at all.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Do you know if you came by plane or... Boat.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
You came by boat? Yeah.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Did you travel with your mother?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
No, no, no. I traveled with...

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Someone came over, a lady, somebody brought me over.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
You know, didn't come over with the parents, no.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And your parents were already here?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Yes, my parents were already here.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And my grandmother looked after me.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
My father's mother looked after me.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
She was a business lady.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
She sold fish, and she also had property that she rented out.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
She was a business lady. She rented them out.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Because she was taking me everywhere with her, selling the fish,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and she collects no rent, and she's the church lady.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
She takes me to church in the evenings,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Sundays, during the week, as well.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
She takes me everywhere with her.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So you remember your grandmother?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Yeah, I remember my grandmother, yeah.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
She was a big influence.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And of course, she used to say to me,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
if you got a pound, you make sure you save 50 pence,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
or save half, or whatever you got.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
You know, that's put me in good stead, you know, here.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Because my husband was from Newport here, you know.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And I can remember once his friend came, wanted him to go out.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And he said... he told him no, he wouldn't.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I said, why don't you go out with him, because you know.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
He said, I got no money, so I gave him five pounds.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
He said, where did you get that five pounds from?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I said, I saved... I said, when I have my money,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I said, even if I got a pound, I make sure I save 50 pence,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and I save 50 pence every week, so I'll have the five pounds.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And he was so... he was so impressed.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
He worked for medical and surgical exhibition.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
So he sent me to work all week.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
He used to give me his wage packet.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And he said, I'll have to get another job,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
so we can go out once or twice a week, so I'll take you out.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And so he taught himself, he bought the book, to do electrician.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And he got a job as electrician.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
He did a warehouse.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And they paid him for it, yeah.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
You know, he's very quick at it.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Where was he from? Was he from St. Kitts as well?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
No, he was from here.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
He was British, and he was from here, you know.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
My mother-in-law, she was Cockney.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
You know, Blomley, Blomley, they were Cockney.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And his sisters, they were Fair, you know.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
All of them.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Okay.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
So you don't remember much about St. Kitts,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
but you remember your grandmother very much.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Yeah.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And she taught you some really key lessons about...

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Yeah, that's what I've learned, yeah.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Because through that, I'm a widow now.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
My husband got killed.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I invited to a wedding for St. Kitts.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And my husband, he's one in all.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
He said, Caribbean people are not one for time.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And he hates to be on time.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
He said, so what I'll do, we're going to London.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
He said, I'll go to college, bring your parents up,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and they can stay here.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And so we all traveled up early then,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
ran away to London.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
So I said, okay.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So I was on his way to Cardiff, and articulated Laurie,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
hit the driver's side and killed him outright.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
You know, so I've been a widow.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
I've been with two children, you know, a boy and a girl.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So I've been widows ever since 40 odd years.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
I've been in Newport now 50 odd years.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
A long time, isn't it?

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Very, very long time, yeah.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
I'm so sorry to hear that.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
That must have been so dramatic for you.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
When I met him, it was my very first time out.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Because I've never been in a club before.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And my friend, they felt sorry for me

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
because I've never been to the park.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
They didn't let us go to the park.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Never been to the park.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Never been to the picture house before ever.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
You'd think I'd just come from abroad.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Parents didn't let us.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
They were very strict.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So my friend kept with his story.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
He said, make sure you're ready when I come for you.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I said, okay.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Because she knew when we're in the house,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
we are closed, which is for the house.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
When we're going out, we change for your best clothes.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
It was like that in those days.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
So when she came, I'd already had a bath

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and put my best clothes underneath

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and my old clothes on the top of it.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
So when she came in, she said, Mr. Brody.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And she was begging him.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And he said to her,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
and he said to her, Gwen's a Christian.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And I heard him.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
I said, oh, but I want to go still.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
He said, Gwen, you can't have God in one hand

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and the devil in the other.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I said, oh, but I want to go.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I can't.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
So it's kind of short story.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
It came to the point.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
He said, yes, so I went.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And it's that night I met my husband.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Oh my gosh.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
That's amazing.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And he said to me, I was telling about God.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And he went, oh, Flo, I don't know what you're on about.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And he invited me to the flicks.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
I said, yes.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I didn't know what the flicks were.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
That's the pictures.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And I asked my father, can I go?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I said, can I go?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
He said, meet who?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
I said a friend.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
He said, what friend?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000
I said, a friend.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
He said, what sort of a friend?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
I couldn't say the word boyfriend.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
You know, sort of a memory like that.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Boyfriend.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And he said, I'll tell you what.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Go and meet him.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Bring him here first.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And then you can go out with him.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
So I met him and I brought him back to the house.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
In Cardicatis.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And then my father asked him, you know, how old he was,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
what his job was, what was his intention, all that.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
He couldn't get over it.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
He was laughing his head off.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
He was telling his friends about it.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And they were in stitches over it.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
He said, I thought I was going back in time, he said.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
In there with them.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
You know.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
How old were you when you met him?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
I met him at 16.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
I got married at 17.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And he said to me, go and I'd be very lucky if I lived to be 28.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And I went to watch.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I thought, oh, is something wrong with him?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
I don't want him no more now.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
But there was nothing wrong with him.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
He just felt it all along.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
I can remember saying to him, Tony, you're 28 and you're still alive.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000
He said to me, Gwen, well, I hate to leave you with nothing.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
I want you to take out the insurance.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I had to take out the insurance for him.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
So I took it out.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And I felt so pleased.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
I went to Cardicatis and sent my file.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Tony, you've told me to take out the insurance if anything happens to him.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
You know, I love him so much.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
My father tore me off.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
He said, you're after a dead man's money.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And that played on my mind, you know.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And I told Tony what he said.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Tony said to me, take the notice of him.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
There's that silly West Indian nonsense.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
He just take the notice of it.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
But I let the insurance, I let it lapse.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And when I let it lapse, I told him.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
He said, we take it out again.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
So I took it out again, you know.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
But it played on my mind, you know, my father said.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
You know, but when it happened, I didn't have no insurance.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
But you work for medical and surgical exhibition.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And the chop farm his way came to see me at the time.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
All in my house discussing, no, she got no insurance.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
All the West Indian nutrition, but no one offered.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Thank you.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And you can get over it.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
So he went back to his boss.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And he told him what was going on.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And the boss, they paid for the funeral,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
cost everything for me, so God was good.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Either way, you know, I still provide you for, you know.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
God was good.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
So when you came over here as a little girl,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
what was it like?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
You had to start going to school, right?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Yeah.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Do you know if you, do you remember going to school

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and getting kids?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Or were you too little to go to school?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
I do not be racking my brains about it.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
I can't remember any.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
I can't remember the experience in school at all.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000
I can't remember that.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
I can't remember that at all.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Do you remember the experience in school in Britain?

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Oh, yes, of course.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
All my experience here, yes.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Tell me a bit about it.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
What was it like for you?

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Well, here the children had pocket money.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
They'd buy crisp and things like that.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
But we never ever had pocket money, never.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And, you know, and they'd all have crisp.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
And they'd give me, you know, one always offer you.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
But I never had no money to go and buy sweets or anything like that.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And they all did, you know, every day same old.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
I think they felt sorry for, you know, that's what they'd offer.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
So your parents were very, very strict.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Did you, did your brothers and sisters come as well,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
or was it just you?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
How, how many siblings do you have?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
There's nine.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
I'm the eldest of nine.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
The eldest of nine.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
They were strict.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
They were strict.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
They, they didn't have pocket money at all either.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Did everybody come over at the same time or?

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
No, towards the time.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
It was towards the time.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Were you one of the first ones to come over or were you later on?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And the later ones was Wingrove.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And then I was the second one.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
I should have been the first, but I said no at the time, I think.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Why did you say no?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
I think my grandmother wanted me as well.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
She didn't want you to go.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
No, she said they wanted me to come.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
But I said stay, I wouldn't be the first.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Okay.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Did you like, so did you like school?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Did you enjoy school?

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Yeah.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Well, I didn't like learning, but yes, I was in school.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Yes.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
What did you want to be when you grew up?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Did you have any dreams?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Oh, I wanted to be, yes, I wanted to be a typist.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
What's the type in Italian?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Yes, so when my husband died, I was in John Ford Square in Newport,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and this blonde lady came up to me and said, excuse me, I said yeah.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
She said, are you working?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I said no.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
She said, do you have a job?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
I said no.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
She said, would you like one?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
I said yes, please.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And she said, what qualifications have you got?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000
I said nothing.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
She goes nothing.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
I goes absolutely nothing.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
I said I've got no qualifications whatsoever.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
She goes nothing.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
She goes try.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
I said, well, I do have pitman's.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000
I done pitman's.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Remember, everywhere there's pitman's.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
That's typing.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
It was typing and shortened in those days.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
That's called qualification.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
She goes pitman's.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
She goes, of course you got qualifications, you know.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And she goes because I'm looking, I mean, they're looking for people to work at the business,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
the Texas office.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Have you heard of it?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
You passed it coming up here.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I worked there for 25 years.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Yeah.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
There I had, you know, a lot of racism there because it wasn't blatant.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
They're all nice to me and they're friendly.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
But when they were marking my report, it was always, I didn't realize it was different.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Rather than get me fitted, it was always likely to be fitted, likely.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And one of the supervisors, she had an accident and broke her leg and she couldn't attend.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000
So the one who was next in line, they asked him to go into the computer room to learn that.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:56.000
No one wanted to do it because if you make a mistake, the whole thing would crash if you miss out a comma or anything like that.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
So the first two refused, so I was next in line, I was the third in line.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
So they asked if I wanted to do it, I said yes.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
So when I went in there, I remember, you know, the speed was very fast.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
My feet was 19,000.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
We all very fast, you know.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000
So I thought to myself, I'll go fast, stop, and I'll check twice before I press it.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
That's what I did.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And the overall boss, she saw me go and I stopped and checked.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
She goes, Gwen, if they saw you there like that, you won't look very professional.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
I'm going to be a bit quicker.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:35.000
She just wanted me to, I know what she was up to, but I just totally ignored and I just carried on because they all wanted me to make a mistake.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
I know they didn't.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:44.000
But anyway, they did call me and they said to me I was doing very good, you know, in there, because I was in there for six months and no accident at all.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And they didn't like it.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
You could see they didn't like it.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
But when I had my report, they still put likely to be fitted.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
What does likely to be fitted mean?

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
It means you're not good enough for promotion.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Likely means either you're good, likely, or you're no good.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
You know, they always gave me the middle.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:13.000
But anyway, I wanted to go in for, I wanted to graduate higher, the next level.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And to the next level, I put in for it.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:27.000
When I put in for it, it happened when I was walking through the corridor, one of their bosses stopped me and said to me, when I hear you're going for the...

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Where's my camera?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And then he said to me, I hear that you're going for the position.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
I said yes, because I'm one of the bosses who will be interviewing you.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
And he said, I'll give you a tip.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
You know, first they look at your shoes.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
If the heat is scuff, it goes against you.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And if it's worn down, you know.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
So he gave me those tips.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
It was good.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:03.000
But anyway, and he said, when the question be on drugs.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
And then going down to the meeting for my interview, I had the radio on.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
And guess what?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
They were talking about drugs.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Someone's been interviewed.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
So I remembered everything they said.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
And I used all that and they told me.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
And then they wrote, I pass, I pass.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
So I was going for the next level.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
But then he said to me, Gwen, we couldn't give it to you because they put likely to be defeated.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
And I said, I don't have to tell you.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
You know, you did well.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
I just smile.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
He said, but we couldn't give you it because they put likely to be defeated.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
So why do you have likely to be defeated?

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
I said, they always give you likely to be defeated.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
They always give me likely to be defeated.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
He said, well, if they feel you're not good enough, you know, to go on.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
He said, what does it take to get you up to that level?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
They should have brought you up to that level.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
They thought, you know, and then they would try.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
So then, you know what happened next, the union men on my side.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
And I knew some of the union men, they were so good, you know, helped me.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
And they sort of took it up with them.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000
But, you know, later on, one thing you know, in hindsight, you know, you could have done push it further, but I didn't.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
You know.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:24.000
And then he said, had we given it to you, there was a question why we gave it to you who had likely to be fitted.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
And those, there was someone done just as well as you who had fitted.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
So they caused a lot of problems, you know.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000
But anyway, when I went back, they called me to the office to say, Gwen, they've got an excellent write-up on you,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
how well you did at the interview and how you'd pass.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
But they couldn't give it to you because they, because I only had likely to be fitted, you know.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
All that was there, you know.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
And all that experience was terrible.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
You were there for 20 something years.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
For over 25 years, yes.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
And never got promoted?

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
No.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
That is disgusting.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
It is, but God is good though because when that lady said to you that blonde woman and they got the job,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000
they only needed, I think it was on their vacancy, permanent vacancy for when.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:22.000
And they called me, I was one of them from, I think I think about a dozen.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
And I was the only one who got the job.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
So I got the job anyway, I skipped it, but never no promotion, but never mind, you know.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
There we go.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
There's lots of things, you know.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
So you got your dream job then because you wanted to be a typist as a child.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Yes, I did.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
That's amazing.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
I was doing, yeah, but you know what?

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
How I done it, when it wasn't just quite typing, it was like, when it was typing,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000
it was all holes like braids, holes in the paper and you had to read them, the holes.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
I got them here somewhere, I can't find it.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
And I think, how on earth did I learn to, how could I read just all holes,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
you know, punching holes?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
How I, how I couldn't understand, how did I manage to learn all those?

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000
But we were taught how to do it, you know, and I think of all that.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
So you left, when you left, I'm going back a bit.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
So when you left primary school.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
We went up to Bishop and Under, that's high school, at 11.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:29.000
I was 11 years old and Lord Snow, Princess Marilyn, Lord Snow opened the school at the time.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
It was a big thing.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Tell me a bit about 11 plus.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Oh, you had to have your exams at that time, didn't you?

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
To get into, you know, school like that, you had to pass the 11 plus.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
But yeah, I saw a lot of people, a lot of people failed the 11 plus at the time.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
But I failed it, but.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Did you want to drink it?

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Did you want to have one?

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
You failed it the first time?

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Yeah, but I passed it after.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
But it's only through, like I said, studying.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
I surprised myself, what I did, I was, because those, in those days,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
you have to memorize the things, do you remember?

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
When you're doing your exams, I used to have the paper all the time,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
I was just writing to myself, you know, all the time and studying.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
And I memorized, so it proves that I could do it.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
So I managed that.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
And then you got to Bishop of like that.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Bishop of Landerfie school, yeah.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
There was a prefect there as well.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
So if you would, how come you were doing so well in school

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
and then said that you had no qualifications at the end of it?

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
No, no, I said, I didn't realize that I didn't have,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
I thought I didn't have no qualifications, but with that I did, you know.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:54.000
So when you left Bishop of Landerfie, you did exams okay after that, to leave?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Oh, but at Bishop of Landerfie, it was time to leave school then.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
We were fifteen, you left school at fifteen then.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Then they just brought in the change that you could stay till you're sixteen.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
But they want to stay till you're sixteen, I wanted to leave.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
And most people would have gotten a trade or something at that point.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
What would people normally do?

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Because fifteen is very young to leave school.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Yeah, that's my father said, oh my friend came and she got me a job.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
It's just in the factory, just packing peanuts, that's all.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
And I said, oh, she goes, do you want to?

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
I said, yes.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
I told my father and he said, no.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
He said, you're too young to go to work.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
I said, oh, my friend's working, I want to go with her.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000
And I remember, I came with my first wage, it was eight pounds.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Eight pounds a month, so I came home and I said to my mother,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
because my friend told me she was giving her mother a keep in a boarding lot.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
So I said to my mother, here's two pounds for my boarding lodge.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
And I told my father, I gave my mother two pounds for my boarding lodge.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Instead, I go to her and ask her to give me the two pounds back

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
because I'm still paying your keep for everyone.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
And I haven't reduced the money, so ask her for your back.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
So I said to her father, you've got to give me the money back.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
And I said, but I don't really want it because that's your keep anyway.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
So let her keep it.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
And he said to me, I'll tell you what.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
I said to him, I had two pounds for my bus fare.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:23.000
And he said to me, with that two pounds, you go to the bank and you save two pounds.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Every month I'd do with that two pounds.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000
So I thought, two pounds for my bus fare, two pounds to save for my clothes,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
two pounds to buy clothes, and two pounds for savings, two for six.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
And the two pounds was for, I don't know, it was all worked out.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Saving, two pounds for buying clothes, two pounds for my mother, yeah.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
I still gave her two pounds, but I didn't know him, you know,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
because I thought she was two pounds.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
My friends were payers, so I should have to pay as well.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
That's amazing.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Did your father have the same philosophy as your grandmother

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
about saving from what you have?

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Yeah, but he wasn't the same.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
My mother was a saver.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
It was my mother, when they were over here, she was either to save

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
so they can buy a house, so they bought a house, looking, they bought it, you know.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
He went for my mother because she was a saver.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
My father wasn't a saver.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Is there anything, I mean, you were lucky to have your big family,

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
to have the experience of your grandmother,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
to come to the country with your father and your mother there,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
and all of your siblings,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
was there anything in the house that reminded you of home,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
or reminded you of some kids, even though you left when you were so young?

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Let's get to what I can remember is that they used to have a gramophone,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
and they'd have them playing the records all the time, you know,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
and the French room, which,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
you heard about the French room, didn't you?

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
The French room experience, the French room is where,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
in the French room, you had all brand new,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
you go into that, all brand new fitted carpets,

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
three piece suites, you know, it was for when the minister comes,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
you go in there, and it teaches anyone like that,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
but the children went aloud.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
They'd keep a lock, lock, specification there.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
There was a program on the TV about the French room.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
In fact, they'd done a play of it.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
So in the French room, you had the gramophone.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Yeah, it was the best room then, if the best, you know, it was lovely.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
You had your gramophone, your new gramophone, TV,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
everything was all nice, but the children wasn't allowed in that room.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Only guests, you know.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
You'd take them in there, you know,

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
you'd give them a cup of tea on the tray with biscuits or whatever, you know.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
You'd treat them nice.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
What about the food? Did your mother cook?

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Yes, Western Indian food, yeah.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Every Sunday we'd have red beans and rice with the meat.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
On a Saturday, it was always soup.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:08.000
It was like, what's the, I'm trying to think, was it shoulder?

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
I forgot the name of the meat.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
I might have used to buy it on a Friday fish.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Yeah, that is familiar for me as well.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
At home, we always, on Saturdays, always soup.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Really?

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Yeah.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Where part of Africa are you from?

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
I'm from Trinidad.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Are you from Trinidad, is it?

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
The name is African, isn't it?

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Yes, my name is African.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Are you a husband, is it?

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
No.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Is that a surname of?

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Adiola is the first name.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Really?

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
The name my parents gave me, yeah.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
I don't know how to say it.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000
It's from Trinidad.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Yes.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
And I spent a lot of my holidays in Syracuse.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:02.000
So growing up here, was there anything that made you feel different?

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
You talked about being at work and not being promoted.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
What about the experience of school?

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
A school experience for them.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
I can't remember what happened in order to grow up with this school.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:39.000
She called me and she went into a black beauty.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
You know.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
That was the way of bringing color into it to really work there.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Apart from that, doing nothing.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
We were friends after anyway, obviously.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
I don't find racism in Canada, if I found it in Newport.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
When did you come to Newport?

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
How old were you?

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
When I got married.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
So, seventeen.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Seventeen.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000
What was that?

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
So how different was the experience?

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
I found the people very, very different.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
In what way?

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Like my friend.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
When she went to church, they'd move her to her seat.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
You know.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
We're called, in Canada.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.000
The reason why the Westinians had their own church, because they weren't welcoming the churches anyway.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
In this country.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
There's a film on telly, it was called.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
I don't know if you saw it, another film.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
A series.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Where the chap said to the girl.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
You know, she was black, he called her.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
He called her.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Exotic.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
He said, anyway, this is in the church, preaching to them all.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
He said, I see we have here an exotic, you know, people in our midst.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
And he said, but it doesn't matter.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
God will allow you in as well.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
That was the mentality.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Because, oh, they do not see you as equal.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
They don't even see you as a human being.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
They don't see you equal to them.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
On a Newport, they're like that.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Did you have any personal experiences of feeling like that?

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
In Newport, when you just came?

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Oh, yes.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Yes.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Very much so.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
I can remember.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
When I was at my.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
My fiance's house, the other time he was marrying.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
One of his mother's friends came in and she said to me.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
I wouldn't mind having one of you.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
I'd give one of you a room in my house.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
I didn't know what she meant by then.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Because in Newport, I said to you, her race is the way they have people.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
What did she mean?

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Was she talking about to help her cook and clean?

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
No, no, no.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
To give me a rent.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
To rent me a room.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
And then when I said that to Tony, he knew what she meant.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
And he said to me, I can remember when he was little.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
That's one of his mother's friends said to him.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
I have one like you.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
And then mixed race child, she was saying.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
He was mixed race, but in school they called him Coco.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
That was his name.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
Because they thought he was really black, you know.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
They used to think half castes, the blackest you can get them.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Didn't see, you know, really darker skin.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
And then he was like, see my granddaughter down there.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Can you see her there with me?

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
You know, it was like that, but they called him white love.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
What I think, knowing what I know now.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000
That when they're born, they're like white in there.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Because she told her that it was a hot day and she forgot about it in the sun.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Because I've heard them describe mixed race child as black as night, you know.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Do you think that that mentality is still like that today?

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Or things have changed?

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
No, the end occurrence is still there now to this day.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
They think they're more superior.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
They don't think that.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
And especially when they're showing all this program all the time.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
With them, they show you Africa with the children, with the war and all that.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Always showing all that.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000
I had to say to them, they keep showing that all the time.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
But who's putting all these images and who's profiting from it?

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000
And they keep saying, oh, in Africa, it's very corrupt.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
That's what they all say.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
And you put, they're so corrupt.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
You know, you can't trust them any in the back hand.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
And they've given them money, they spend it.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000
I said, but then, because I went to Africa and I said to them and I came back.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
You're lucky if 10% leave this country to go to Africa.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Because it's charity, it's more business.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
It's a big business.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
And it pays the wages.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
That's what it's all about.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
It's terrible.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
You know, a friend of mine, she came here and she was white.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
And she couldn't believe she went to Swansea.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
And she saw all these chains around the neck and the arms like that.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000
She couldn't believe it.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
It was in the museum showing you what it was like in slavery day.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
She couldn't believe.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000
She found out afterwards that that's how they treated human beings.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
I said, that's because the Bible says the heart of man is deceitfully wicked.
