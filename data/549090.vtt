00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Fy enw i yw Yvonne Marie Morris a roeddwn i'n cael ei ddweud yn 23 meir 1946.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:26.000

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Rydw i'n cael ei ddweud yn Antwerp, yng Nghymru, yn 1946.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Mae'n fater wedi'i cymryd yno gyda'r ymddygiad ym Mhob, yn ymchwil ym Mhob, yn ymchwil ym Mhob.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Roeddwn i'n cael ei ddweud ym Mhob, oherwydd fy fater yn oed yn ymchwil ym Mhob, yn 1955, ym mhob 56, oherwydd fy fater yn dda iawn iawn a ddweud ei fod yn mynd yn ymchwil ym Mhob.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Mae gen i un brif o'n Brian, sy'n edrych yn Barry, mae oedd yn fwy oed yn fwy oed.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Ymddygiad ym Mhob yn ddiforol oherwydd roeddwn i ddim yn ddweud unrhyw ddweud o'r Ynglwys pan ddodais i'r ymddygiad ym Mhob.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Mae tolygu'r gyd tag brushed a i lam yn nghystathroedd pryd yr Aelod hwn很多i'd!!!!!

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.400
ac yna ddim yn chof ragwغon ac fe wneud i gonellad y cyngor yn llarch Byrth.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.740
Rwy'n dweud y gallwn chi weld branches y Deusspace Me раст 50 mân.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:52.760
Ond yna dwi wedi mynd yn A Taskbarth

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.760
yn cael cymorth yn gael gwaith i gyd.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.760
A'n mynd i gael gradd cyhoeddus cyhoeddus i'r ystafell ym Mhob i'r Unedig.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.760
Rwy'n mynd i ddwylo ym 16.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.760
Roeddwn i'n dechrau gweithio fel tîm hwyl.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.760
Rwy'n credu bodwn i'n ymwneud ymlaen, yn bwysig, nid ym mlynedd.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.760
Roeddwn i'n bwrdd, Rydgid. Roeddwn i'n hollol.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.760
Felly roeddwn i'n gweithio'n ddwylo o weithiau, oherwydd roeddwn i ddim yn gallu gysylltu i beth.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:33.760
Roeddwn i'n gweithio mewn siopau fel siopasistyn, roeddwn i'n gweithio mewn milanus, roeddwn i'n gweithio fel nannu.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:42.760
Mae'n dda iawn i'r ddwy o ffamlwyr yn y Gawa, y peninsulaeth Gawa.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.760
Ond yn y ffordd, roeddwn i'n meddwl bod yn fwyaf yn gweithio'n gweithio'n dda,

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.760
a rhywbeth sy'n cael ei gweithio'n dda yn dda, a dyna oherwydd ymlaen o weithiau fy mhob.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.760
Felly roeddwn i'n gweithio'n dda yn Addis.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.760
Fe fyddwch chi'n mynd i, a allwn i ddweud a ddweud sut wnaeth chi'n ei ffeirio am ddod o ddwylo,

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.760
yn y ffordd os ydych chi'n dweud eich broedd yn fwy fwy.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.760
Mae'n dda iawn i mi yn ystod ystod hynny, oherwydd roedd hi'n ymlaen i mi.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.760
Ond fel y byddai'n mynd yn dda, mae'n dda i mi.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.760
Felly roeddech chi eisiau ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod?

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.760
O, mae'n dda, dwi ddim yn fwyaf am ddod o ddod.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.760
O, roedd fy ffrindiau wedi ddod o ddod yn y ddod, ac roeddech chi'n gwybod bod ni'n gweithio'n dda ar ddod o ddod,

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.760
a'i gael gilydd a chydw i gyd ac am y pethau a'i gyd.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.760
Roeddwn i'n gwybod bod hynny ddim yn fwyaf amdano. Roeddwn i'n gwybod pan oeddwn i'n ysgol,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.760
roeddwn i'n fwyaf amdano. Felly roedd hynny'n bwysig o ddysgu i fy ffrindiau.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.760
Ond roeddech chi'n gwybod bod hi'n gwybod.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.760
A yna roeddwn i'n gweithio yn Addis.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.760
A oherwydd nad oeddwn i ddim gael unrhyw ffrindiau ymlaen,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.760
a dydw i ddim yn gydol â'r ffrindiau i fy ffrindiau,

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.760
ond roeddwn i'n gwybod bod y ffrindiau sydd wedi'n gweithio yn y ffattr

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.760
yn cael ffrindiau a pham mynd i.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.760
Ar ôl iawn, dydw i ddim yn gwybod y pethau yma,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.760
ond y ffrindiau sydd wedi'i ffôn ar y ffrindiau'r gyd

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.760
oedd yn ffrindiau sy'n cael ffrindiau i fy ffrindiau.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.760
Mae'n anodd i'r 16 oed,

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.760
oherwydd byddai rhai o ffrindiau i'n dechrau'r gwaith a chyflen.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.760
Mae'r ffrindiau sy'n cael ffrindiau yn cael ffrindiau yn ffrindiau,

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.760
yn cael ffrindiau yn ymlaen,

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.760
ac mae'n anodd i'r pethau yn y ffrindiau.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.760
Felly, dydw i ddim yn gwybod hynny yn y peth,

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.760
ac weithio yno,

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.760
roedd yn dda iawn i gyd yn ffrindiau a chyflen.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.760
Yn ogystal â hynny,

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.760
gallwch chi ddechrau i mi,

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.760
fel y dydd yma yn y ffattr,

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.760
a beth oedd oedd fel?

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.760
Beth oedd yn cael ei dda, beth oedd yn cael ei dda,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.760
beth oedd yn dda?

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.760
O, ddod i.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.760
Y peth a'n dda,

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.760
a'r ddŵr ymlaen,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.760
y ddŵr yma yn y ffrindiau,

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.760
oherwydd bod yr holl ffrindiau yn mynd,

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.760
a phan o'r holl ffrindiau yn cael ei ddweud,

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.760
a oedd yn dda,

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.760
a'n dda,

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.760
a'n dda,

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.760
roedd yn dda,

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.760
er mwyn bod llawer o llwythiau,

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.760
roedd yn dda,

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.760
ac roedd yn dda,

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.760
ac roedd yn dda,

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.760
ac roedd yn dda,

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.760
O, ddod i beth oedd yna o'r hyn?

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.760
Rwy'n dechrau fel pakellwr,

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.760
oherwydd rydyn ni'n gweithio gyda llwythiau plasti,

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.760
ydych chi'n gwybod,

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.760
i'r holl,

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.760
mae angen i chi ddod yn ymlaen,

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.760
a rwy'n gwneud hynny yn oed,

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.760
felly mae angen i chi wneud ymlaen.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.760
Ie, dyna sut rydw i dechrau.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.760
Oherwydd rhai o'r mwynt yma,

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.760
peidio'n ffwrdd,

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.760
peidio'r pethau gwahanol

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:51.760
ymlaen. A sut ydych chi'n cael gweithio hynny?

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.760
Wel, roedd yn ddiddorol, ond rwy'n meddwl, yw'ch ddod oedd yn ffyrdd a'i ddod,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.760
a'ch gydag chi'n gwybod â'i, e.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:05.760
A oedd yn ffyrdd o'n ffyrdd neu oedd yn dda?

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.760
Yn ffyrdd, dwi ddim yn credu bod yn ffyrdd. Nid, oherwydd, yn ffyrdd,

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.760
az y byddwn hefyd usbonio'r usubauؤ'r катwysoedd naturiol i chi am dizendo'r gwasanaethze.

ac rwy am Danni gael Orffogνοi a'i Gríhiadledd.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.760
Felly, dwi'n mynd i ddod y plen?

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.760
Roeddwn i'n ddweud, pan dweud y byddwch chi'n mynd i weithio yno,

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.760
roeddwch chi'n dweud y byddwch chi'n gwneud ffrindiau gyda phobl, ond roedd y byddwch chi'n ffrindiau yno?

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.760
A oeddwch chi'n gwybod pobl sy'n weithio yno pan dweud y byddwch chi'n weithio yno?

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.760
Nid.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.760
Nid.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.760
Dwi ddim yn credu bod yna.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.760
Nid, oherwydd roeddwn i'n mynd i ffrindiau i'n dda,

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.760
ond mae'r 16 oedau a oeddwn i'n gwybod yn y sgol yn dda,

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.760
yn dda, ddim yn mynd i weithio yn Addis.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.760
Rwy'n meddwl, mae'r unrhyw unrhyw un, maen nhw'n mynd i Manic Bach,

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.760
maen nhw'n mynd i weithio yn y brifysgol,

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.760
neu maen nhw'n mynd i weithio yn y brifysgol.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.760
Mae'n rhaid i fydd yn mynd i weithio yn y brifysgol.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.760
Why did you choose Addis out of interest?

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.760
No particular reason, just that it was close to home.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.760
And how did you get there?

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.760
On the bus, with all the other women.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.760
We went through the estate and we picked everybody up,

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.760
so it was the same group of people going and coming back every day.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.760
Were they factory buses?

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.760
No, they were public transport buses.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.760
Did you have a test or an interview for the job?

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.760
Oh yes, I was interviewed.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.760
Gosh, I can't remember what they asked me.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.760
Well, I suppose they must have asked me why I didn't continue working as a short-term typist,

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.760
as I got the qualification for doing that,

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.760
and why I wanted to work in the factory.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.760
But I don't remember what I answered.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.760
Well, I probably told them I was bored stiff

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.760
and wanted something a bit more challenging and interesting to do.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.760
But I had reasonably good qualifications from school and from college,

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.760
so they seemed quite keen to have me there.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.760
I did work on the telephone switchboard there for a while as well,

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.760
answering incoming calls and connecting people.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:40.760
I did train to work on the old-fashioned switchboards with the leads going in.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.760
They were fantastic things.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:49.760
So did your job change while you were at his then?

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.760
No, I did that while the telephonist was away,

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.760
or if she was off on holiday or ill or she did have maternity leave,

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.760
things like that I'd fill in.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.760
But no, I went back onto the factory floor

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.760
and I just eventually began working on the machines,

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.760
which were quite dangerous actually.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.760
Although they did have safety guards on them,

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.760
they were still quite dangerous things.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.760
So I did eventually start working on the machinery

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:19.760
and then later on still training other people how to operate the machinery.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:25.760
So just explain to me then what the machines did.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.760
Well, what they actually did was they trimmed the brushes

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.760
because they all had to be a standard size.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:38.760
And they also attached the bristles to the plastic handles.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.760
You lined them all up on the machine

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.760
and then the bristles would be attached to the plastic handles.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.760
And you also individually by hand sometimes

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.760
had to make sure that the bristles were of a standard size

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.760
so you actually had to run a brush through a machine which kept the bristles.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.760
And as I recall, you did that by hand.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.760
So that could have been extremely dangerous to do.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.760
I don't remember us having any special gloves or even glasses,

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.760
though we must have had safety glasses.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.760
I don't remember wearing them

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:17.760
because the very sharp little nylon bristles flew in all directions.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.760
I must have had safety glasses, though I don't remember wearing them.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.760
But some of the machines were quite large.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.760
I was going to ask you about health and safety then.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.760
What was health and safety like at the factory?

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.760
Well, they did all have safety guards on.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.760
We were given good training, I have to be honest, on how to operate.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.760
We were constantly being told to be careful

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.760
and that these machines were dangerous.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:51.760
So considering it was all that time ago, I suppose it wasn't too bad, to be fair.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.760
How long was the training?

00:10:54.760 --> 00:11:00.760
I can't remember. It was weeks. It must have been weeks.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.760
What about the other conditions in the factory?

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:11.760
The thing was, we only had a break in the morning,

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.760
a cup of tea or a cup of coffee,

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.760
and we sat down at our machines or on the line, wherever we were.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.760
We just stopped when the hooter went

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:25.760
and had our 15 minutes break for a cup of coffee or whatever.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.760
Then we carried on and we had staggered lunch breaks.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:34.760
They were from 12 to half past 12, half past 12 to 1, 1 to 1 to 1.30.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.760
Different groups went at different times.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.760
That was half an hour.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.760
Then in the afternoon we had a break of about three.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.760
Again, we sat down wherever we had to be working,

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.760
had a drink and a 15 minute break again.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:56.760
Was there a canteen there?

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.760
There was a canteen and the food was very good.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.760
That's where we all went for our lunch break.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.760
No, the food was good, I remember that.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.760
We had a proper decent lunch.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.760
What about the building itself? Was it hot, cold?

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:19.760
It was extremely hot because all the roofs were glass.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:24.760
The sun just absolutely hammered down when the sun was shining.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.760
It was really hot to work underneath the light.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.760
Those were the only windows. There were no windows in the building.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.760
The sun would come in through the roof.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.760
It was extremely hot in the summer and extremely cold in the winter.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.760
I can remember many occasions where we worked in our coats,

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.760
without coats and scarves on.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:49.760
I was going to ask you about the union, but before I go on there,

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.760
you mentioned about time and motion people as well.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.760
Could you tell me about that?

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.760
We regularly had time and motion people coming in and watching us,

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.760
observing us to see how fast we were working or how slow we were working

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.760
or how many an hour would be a reasonable number to do.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:15.760
It was almost always more than we thought we could manage.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.760
We had to speed up.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.760
Those people were dreaded.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:28.760
They knew every time they came that they would probably push the numbers up

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.760
that were required.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.760
They never went down, they always went up.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.760
We never looked forward to that at all.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.760
We thought, oh God, here we go again, they want more.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.760
To increase profits, obviously.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.760
We got less and they always increased profits,

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.760
which I suppose at the end of the day is what they're there for.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:55.760
We always got less in our pay packets than they got in theirs.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.760
We always felt that anyway.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:04.760
There was some I can't remember how it worked mathematically now,

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.760
but we were always on the losing end of it anyway.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.760
But then if they don't make a profit, we don't have jobs

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.760
and the factory doesn't continue to operate.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.760
So something you got used to really.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.760
What about the union then? Was there a union?

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.760
The first thing I did was join a union.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.760
Do you remember which union it was?

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.760
Transport and General Work as it was then.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.760
Yeah, it's the first thing we did really.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.760
We had regular union meetings.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.760
On the whole, we didn't have a lot of problems to be honest with them as employees

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.760
because the pay rate was reasonable.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:46.760
But it was the conditions that really bothered us.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.760
Oh God, I knew she'd do this.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:55.760
Okay, you were talking about the union.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.760
I'll ask you then, were there any disputes?

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.760
The only ones I can remember were in the winter

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.760
when we had to work in our coats and we were so cold.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.760
I remember there being a dispute about that.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.760
The heating was never sufficient.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.760
It just never seemed to penetrate.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.760
The building was so huge.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.760
We were never aware of any great heat.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.760
We all complained about it and nothing appeared to be done.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.760
I suppose they would have had to do quite a big job in putting decent heating in

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.760
and they were reluctant to do it.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.760
So we did all decide to go out, to walk out.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.760
We did have a strike.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.760
I can remember us all walking out en masse

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.760
and us being in the local paper, which was Evening Post.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.760
It's still going in Swansea.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:54.760
Also being on the local news, on the BBC, on the local Welsh news, if you don't behave.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:58.760
Were most of you members of the union?

00:15:58.760 --> 00:15:59.760
Yes.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.760
Did you become an official or anything?

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.760
No, I wasn't an official.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.760
No, I wasn't there long enough and I was so young.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.760
Obviously I was one of the youngest ones there really,

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.760
so it would have been a much older person than me.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.760
Can you describe to me, you were talking about the brushes,

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:23.760
but can you describe to me what was made in the factory altogether?

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:32.760
Things like dish racks, cutlery trays, sink tidies,

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:40.760
scrubbing brushes, sweeping brooms, mops,

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:45.760
anything that you can think of that you could use in a home or in the kitchen specifically,

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.760
anything that was made of plastic.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.760
It was made there.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.760
Yeah, that was it really.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.760
Anything else? Sweeping...

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.760
Sink tidies, everything like that really.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.760
So, did you enjoy working at the factory?

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.760
It's a difficult question to answer that really.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.760
Some aspect of it I enjoyed.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.760
But as time went on, I became quite frustrated

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.760
and felt that there was something more I could be doing.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.760
If you know what I mean.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.760
I wasn't being stretched.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.760
What about the workforce? Was it mainly women?

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:40.760
Yes.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.760
How many people were there?

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.760
Must have been hundreds.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.760
I don't remember there being any male employees.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.760
Apart from, strangely enough, the bosses who were all male.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.760
The supervisors were female and all the workers were female.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.760
It was a huge building, so I have no idea how many actually...

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.760
Oh, for goodness sake!

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.760
I was a bit worried about the work.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.760
I was worried about the work.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.760
For goodness sake!

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.760
So, mainly women then?

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.760
Well, mainly all women except for the bosses.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.760
Except for the bosses.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.760
Were there what you considered unskilled and skilled jobs?

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.760
Oh, now I think about it.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.760
There was a workshop where they repaired...

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.760
They did all the repairs and that was all male.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.760
But you know, in all the years I was there,

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.760
I never walked into it, I never went there.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.760
But I did speak to some of the men who worked there.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.760
That would be considered skilled work.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.760
Because they were the men that fixed the machines when they broke down.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.760
And anything that was broken, they would fix it.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.760
So that was considered skilled.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.760
Working on the machines was skilled.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.760
Because, you know, obviously it took a lot more skill to operate a machine

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.760
than it did to pack an item.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.760
Yeah, so that would be considered more skilled.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.760
Were you paid more to work on the machine than you?

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.760
Yes.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.760
Well, your rate increased just the longer you were there anyway.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.760
You got increments, you know.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.760
They paid you for loyalty basically, the longer you stayed.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.760
Your pay went up incrementally anyway if you stayed.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:29.760
Because so many people left, obviously, when they had children and stuff.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.760
And then came back when their children were grown up quite often.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.760
So there was a big gap.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.760
No, the pay increased.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.760
It increased with time spent.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:46.760
And obviously there were things like if you were promoted to a supervisory position,

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.760
your rates obviously went up.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:58.760
I'd like to ask you actually, because you did all these other things first.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.760
How old were you when you went to work there?

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.760
And what year was it?

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.760
I think it was 1963.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.760
So you were 19?

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.760
No, I was born in 1946.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:16.760
Oh, sorry, 17.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.760
Yeah.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.760
I think it was either 16 or 17.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.760
I think it was, I left school at 16.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:30.760
And none of my jobs lasted more than a few weeks before I went to Addis.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.760
I wasn't yet 17 before I went there, don't I?

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.760
Great, OK.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.760
Sorry.

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.760
So were there married women working in the factory?

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:45.760
Oh yes, lots of them.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.760
Yeah, and there was no problem with that?

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:48.760
No.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.760
And what about when you said when they had children they came back?

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.760
Were there any child caring facilities in the factory?

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.760
Oh no.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.760
Oh good Lord, not in 1963.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.760
It didn't even enter their thinking.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.760
No way.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.760
No.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.760
There were women with young children who were working there.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:12.760
How they coped, I don't know, because they didn't even leave at three to pick up their children from school.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:17.760
So it must have been their mothers who did that, or members of the family.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:23.760
Because they had to finish at four, four thirty, and that was long after the kids had come home from school.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:24.760
Yeah.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:28.760
Oh no, that wouldn't have even occurred to them in those days.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:33.760
You weren't encouraged to have time off, even if your child was ill, you know, that was tough really.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.760
You had to come in to work, whatever.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.760
They kept a very, very keen eye on the number of days you took off sick.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:46.760
A lot of us used to have very painful periods.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.760
I was one of those, I was usually in agony.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:55.760
And standing when you had an extremely painful period was not funny.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.760
And I quite often used to end up in the sick room.

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.760
We had a sick room.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:04.760
And a nurse who worked there and who would give you pills if the pain got too bad.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:09.760
Or you were even allowed to lie down for a bit if the pain got too bad.

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.760
And then when the pain wore off, you had to go back on your machine.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.760
There was no question of you going home.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.760
Because obviously their argument was that they would be sending you all home.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.760
Because in all our periods, possibly at the same time, you'd all be going off.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.760
And the factory would come to a complete stop.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.760
So tough you had to get on with it really.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.760
So yeah, they were very tight on sick time.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.760
Any kind of sick time.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:37.760
The person with the least sick time was always praised very highly.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.760
And that was easy for me because I had no family.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.760
I had nothing to worry about except myself.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.760
So I never took sick time.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.760
It's a different issue if you've got children.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.760
It's not that you're idle.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.760
It's that you've got other priorities and commitments you have to see to.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:56.760
So yeah, I was always, well done Yvonne, you haven't taken any sick time this year.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.760
And I thought, well, fine.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.760
I've only got myself to bother about really.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.760
If you did take sick time, was there sick pain?

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.760
Yes.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.760
Do you remember how much that was?

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.760
No, it was too long ago.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.760
It was too long ago now.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.760
Can we go on to wages anyway?

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:24.760
Can you remember how much you were paid a week at the beginning?

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:31.760
I know when I was working that year before I started in Addis as a shorthand typist, I think it was,

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:35.760
I was earning about £3.15 a week in those days.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.760
It must have been in that area.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.760
It certainly wasn't less because I was happy with the money that I got.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:47.760
You know, being a single person, I mean, it was a reasonable amount of money.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.760
Are you still living at home then?

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.760
Oh yes.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.760
Did you give your mum?

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.760
I gave my mum some money, yeah.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:58.760
She didn't ask for a lot to be fair.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:02.760
Yes, no, I didn't leave home until I was in my twenties.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.760
So what did you do with the rest of the money? Do you remember?

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.760
Just enjoyed it really. Spent it.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.760
Went shop.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.760
Do you remember?

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.760
Well, I like going to the cinema, so I used to go a lot.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:23.760
And the usual stuff, I suppose, buy clothes, records, particularly because I loved music.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:28.760
Bought loads of records, went into town with my friends and just enjoyed spending it really.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.760
You know, you say they played music in the factory.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:37.760
Do you remember whether it was on the radio or did people just take records?

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.760
It was on the radio. The radio was always on. Nonstop really.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.760
Do you remember which station that was?

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.760
No, probably Radio 2.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:49.760
The light service.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.760
The light service. The light programme as it was called then.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.760
The light programme, yeah.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.760
Yes, popular music.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.760
Pre-radio.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:02.760
Pre-radio too. Yes, yeah, popular music. Music non-stop really.

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.760
So you don't remember any pay rises or anything like that?

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:12.760
Do you remember how much it was when you left, for example?

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.760
No, but it was higher than when I started.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.760
I know it went up.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:23.760
That's all I was concerned about. It went up rather than down.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.760
No, I can't remember now. That's too long ago really.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.760
Did you have to wear any kind of uniform?

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:37.760
No, we all wore overalls. Not overalls. Yes, overalls.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:43.760
Not overalls. What do they call them?

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.760
Well, I suppose it was a kind of overall.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.760
No, we always brought our own in.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.760
We bought them ourselves.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:54.760
What we chose, what we wanted to do was to have a uniform.

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.760
We bought them ourselves.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.760
What we wore, we bought ourselves. It wasn't provided for us.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:05.760
Right, okay. So you could buy any kind of...?

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:11.760
Well, we bought our own stuff in order to obviously take care of our own clothing,

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:16.760
so that wasn't damaged in any way or made dirty or whatever.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:20.760
Was that an issue that they didn't pay for your protective clothing?

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.760
I think people did complain about it, yes.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:28.760
I think some people felt that they should be provided.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:37.760
Do you remember any injuries that people had during...?

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:42.760
You said that some of the machines were quite dangerous.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.760
Yes, I do remember them being minor though.

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.760
They weren't anything major, like nobody lost a limb or anything,

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.760
or a finger or a hand or anything like that.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.760
There were some minor cuts and minor injuries, but nothing major.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:13.760
You said it was quite noisy. Did you have any hearing...?

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:17.760
I remember some people having it.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:22.760
If the machines were particularly noisy, but the rest of us no.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:26.760
Even though we were in the same area as the machines,

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:30.760
when you were packing, the machines were kind of all around you

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:35.760
and the noise level was just as high really, but we didn't have any.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:39.760
But then you see, we weren't keen on wearing them anyway

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.760
because we were talking to each other all the time.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:46.760
We kept you sane talking to other people and having a laugh,

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:50.760
and you couldn't have heard them, so we wouldn't have worn them.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.760
Well, we would have worn them reluctantly.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:28:02.760
Like we knew many other women in the past, lip read as a way of communicating with each other,

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.760
and that's probably what we would have done.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.760
We would have learned to lip read.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:15.760
The noisiest machines you were told to wear your earmuffs to protect yourself.

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:25.760
Do you feel that you suffered any long-term health issues from your work there?

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.760
No.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.760
Were you allowed to smoke?

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.760
Oh, that was a massive issue.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:38.760
We weren't allowed to smoke on the factory floor,

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.760
and everybody wanted to smoke during their break,

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:45.760
and because we were on the factory floor it wasn't allowed, and it was a massive issue.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:50.760
We all felt that we should be able to go to a room, not me, I've never smoked in my entire life,

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.760
but all my colleagues felt that they should be allowed to go to a specific room

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:59.760
that was set aside downstairs for people who smoked,

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:03.760
or even a specific room where we could take our sandwiches or a snack,

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:07.760
or to take our coffee breaks rather than sit on the factory floor,

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:11.760
so everybody would go to the toilets as often as they could get away with,

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.760
and have a quick fag in there.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:19.760
But quite often the supervisors would follow you in and double-check you weren't smoking,

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:24.760
and you had to go into the actual loo itself and lock the door,

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:28.760
but they could always smell it and see the smoke rising and whatever,

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.760
and they used to tell you to put it out,

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:35.760
it was a bit like a regime where people watched you and followed you in there.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.760
What about going to the toilet, did you have to have permission?

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:42.760
Yes, particularly if you were on, well no, in either event,

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.760
whether you were on a machine or on a line packing,

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.760
you always had to say, I'm clocking off, going to the loo,

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.760
and then I'm back kind of thing now,

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:57.760
because of course you had to make up that time to make sure that that number of hours,

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:03.760
the number of packages or the number of brushes you had to do that hour were caught up with,

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.760
so whatever time you spent in the loo, you had to make it up when you came back

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.760
and make sure within that hour you got that number back,

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:16.760
so you were going like the clappers when you got back to your station to make sure you didn't lose out.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.760
So did you have to clock in in the morning then?

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.760
Yes.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.760
And clock out when you went into the toilet?

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:23.760
Yes.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:24.760
Clock out for you?

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.760
No, we didn't clock out, we didn't use the clock,

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:31.760
but we had to say, is it okay if I go to the loo,

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.760
and I'm going now kind of thing.

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:39.760
So did you just clock out in the evening?

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.760
Yes, morning and evening, clock in and clock out when you left.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.760
So who timed your breaks then?

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:50.760
Well there were always supervisors on the floor, quite often they used to sit with you in groups,

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:56.760
and they'd look at their watches and say, right, 50 minutes is up now guys, back to work.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:01.760
I mean it was just a strict for them in a sense, because they couldn't go anywhere either really,

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.760
except that they did have their own office.

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:09.760
So they could have their sandwiches in there and have a drink in there any time they wanted really.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.760
Did you get on with the supervisors?

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.760
They varied, they varied.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.760
I mean obviously they vary as individuals, some are much nicer than others, you know,

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:24.760
so some were quite reasonable human beings and others were not.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:28.760
Some we felt were more sort of sympathetic and empathetic with the workforce,

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.760
and others were definitely not.

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:35.760
They were very much, you know, the bosses.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:39.760
And they kind of watched us.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:45.760
I remember we had one from Scotland who was absolutely terrifying.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.760
Everybody was scared of her, she was so strict.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.760
And then we had another one, a local girl, who was absolutely lovely.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:59.760
And she came to the loose with everybody and had to fag herself,

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.760
which probably could have got her sacked.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:06.760
So you had that huge spectrum, you had some that were really nice and others not so nice.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:11.760
Why did the supervisors come from, what I mean is, did they come from the factory floor,

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.760
or were they given jobs?

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.760
Both, some could be promoted from the factory floor,

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:22.760
and some came in as supervisors having worked elsewhere.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.760
It varied really.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.760
Come to think of it, I don't remember many promotions within the factory.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:34.760
Even the women who had been there many, many years that I was friendly with,

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:40.760
unless they didn't actually apply for supervisory positions, maybe that was it.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.760
Maybe they didn't want them.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.760
But no, I tended to be women who came in as supervisors.

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:52.760
But nearly all of them had factory experience, they'd worked on factory floors.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:59.760
How were you, the workers, viewed by other people in Swansea?

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:04.760
Was it a perfectly good job?

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.760
Yes.

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.760
I was very happy.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.760
I was very happy.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.760
I was very happy.

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.760
How were you, the workers, viewed by other people in Swansea?

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.760
Was it a perfectly good job?

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.760
Yes.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.760
We weren't looked down on in any way.

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.760
Oh no, I never felt that.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:34.760
No, not by anybody.

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.760
No.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.760
So how many days did you work a week?

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.760
Five days, Monday to Friday.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.760
No.

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:50.760
I never did any overtime at weekends.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:56.760
I remember not being pressured into doing weekend work.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:59.760
Nobody ever pressured me into doing weekend work.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.760
But there was weekend work.

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.760
I mean there must have been because the factory was open seven days a week.

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.760
So there must have been.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:10.760
And how many hours a day?

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.760
7.30am to 4.30am or 8am to 4.30am.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.760
Something like that.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:21.760
So quite long days then, especially with no breaks in different places.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.760
Were there shifts then?

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.760
Were you aware of people doing shifts?

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.760
Yes, I didn't do them though.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.760
I only worked those hours.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:37.760
Do you think that was because you were younger or you didn't want to,

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:42.760
I'm sorry, I don't mean to lead you, but you weren't even asked, were you?

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:45.760
Nobody ever asked me, no.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.760
No.

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:55.760
No, I'm pretty sure, as far as I can remember it, we all left at the same time.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:59.760
We all finished at the same time because there was a mass exodus.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:03.760
So I'm not sure what happened after that, what happened in the evening.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:08.760
Because I remember, I mean there was a mass of women all going at the same time.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:12.760
So we must have all vacated the factory together.

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:21.760
What about holidays with pay, holiday allowance?

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.760
Do you remember anything about that?

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:28.760
I can't remember what the holiday allowance was.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:33.760
I mean we had paid holidays, probably only a fortnight a year or something.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:43.760
Do you remember if you could pick your holidays or was it this minus holiday thing?

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.760
No.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:50.760
Did the factory close down or did people take different holidays?

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.760
No, people took different holidays.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:53.760
No, the factory didn't close down.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.760
We all had stacket holidays.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.760
Obviously you had to put in your request for a holiday in advance.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.760
Yes.

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.760
And what about bank holidays?

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.760
Yes, we had bank holidays off.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.760
And was the factory shut down?

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.760
No idea.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.760
I can't remember whether it was shut or not.

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:16.760
Okay.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.760
Where did you go on holiday?

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:25.760
Well, because as I said I was born in Belgium, we always went back to Belgium.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.760
My mother's family were all still there, her sister and her mother.

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:33.760
So we always spent our fortnight going back to Belgium to see my mother's family.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.760
So it was pretty much the same every year for us really.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.760
So you didn't take any independent?

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.760
Not until I was much older and my grandmother in Belgium and my aunt.

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:47.760
Well, my grandmother eventually passed away obviously.

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.760
But we still continued to go after that.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:53.760
I've got a photograph of myself there when I was 18.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.760
I was in Belgium then on holiday.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:01.760
And we carried right on going until I was quite old.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:06.760
Over 20, we were still going every year.

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.760
Right.

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.760
Good.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:15.760
You mentioned the sickness days alone.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:20.760
Were you allowed days for personal reasons?

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:32.760
Funerals, maybe it didn't happen to you, but were you aware of difficulty if people needed to go to a funeral or any other kind of personal reason?

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:37.760
No, I think you were asked permission to go to a funeral, but I don't remember ever being refused.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.760
Right.

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.760
Okay.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.760
Okay then, so down to the social life.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:50.760
Were there any social activities organised by the workers?

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:58.760
Well, I mean in the sense that if anybody had a birthday or a special event, we all sort of celebrated it together.

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:09.760
And Christmas time, we all had a works do as they used to call it, where we all went to a club together and had a Christmas party and Christmas meal and stuff.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.760
Where did you go? Do you remember?

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:20.760
Yeah, I can't remember what it was called now, but it's still there because I passed it a few, when I went recently.

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:28.760
Something like the, not the Star Inn, no that was the other end of Glansamle.

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:36.760
It's still there as you go into Swansea, on the right hand side as you're driving into Swansea.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.760
So was it down near town?

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.760
Very near town.

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.760
Was it near the factory?

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:52.760
It was only a few minutes drive from the factory or a few minutes on the bus from the factory. It was very local.

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:57.760
Right. Explain to me where the factory was because you explained to me on the phone.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:04.760
Well, it's in Pentrichwyth because it was right next to the river, but you actually go through Boli Mine.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:11.760
That's where you get off the bus and then you walk down a very, very steep hill because it was right alongside the river.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:15.760
So it was really in Boli Mine, I would say.

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.760
Okay, is it still there?

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:23.760
Well, I'm obviously not operating anymore, but I'm told the buildings are still there.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.760
Right, okay.

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:42.760
So a Christmas dance, can you remember any special Christmas dance or were they all the same? Were they good?

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:50.760
No, I mean we just had, yeah, everybody got drunk basically. We had a nice meal, everybody got drunk, we went to this club.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:58.760
It's a pub restaurant it was, kind of. Wish I could remember what it was called because it would come to me.

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:07.760
If you're driving into Swansea from Cardiff, just before you get to what is now, is it Sainsbury's on the left?

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:17.760
Just before, there's a set of traffic lights and if you look to your right, that place still exists that we used to go to.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:26.760
There's a kind of pub club there on the right hand side before you go through those traffic lights past Sainsbury's and so on and go further down.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:39.760
That club is still there. So I'm not sure what area of Swansea that would be, whether it would be Port Tennant or if it's too far towards Swansea to be Port Tennant.

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.760
But it's still there anyway.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:42.760
I know what you mean.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:47.760
So did you go there for the birthday parties as well? Was it always the same place?

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:57.760
Yeah, we tended to go to the same place, yes. Or sometimes we'd go to pubs, you know, obviously pubs in Swansea.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.760
What about trips? Did you go on trips?

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:03.760
Don't remember any trips at all, none at all, no.

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:11.760
So you said you were friendly with the older women and the factory. Was there a good camaraderie?

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:25.760
Yes. Yes, we were all very tight. Oh yes, we were always aware of one another's private lives and personal issues that were going on with people's marriages and relationships and stuff. Oh yeah.

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.760
And did you remain friends with them after you left?

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.760
After I left the factory?

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:31.760
Yes.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:38.760
Oh yes, we all remained on good terms, but obviously, you know, eventually I left Swansea completely, so I didn't see them anymore.

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:45.760
No, no, no. The thing is, if you start another job and they're still working there, you're not going to come across one another very much.

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:52.760
It's just, you know, you're deliberately avoiding one another, but unless you live very close to each other.

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:56.760
I had one or two close friends, though, I continued to keep in touch with.

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.760
Even now?

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.760
Oh no, not since I left Swansea. No.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:09.760
I mean, there'll all be a lot of them being a better place now, won't they? I mean, they were twenty odd years older than I was, so they'll be long gone, really.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:14.760
So how long were you with the factory for?

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:34.760
I don't know exactly how long I was there, because I left to work. I know I went from there to a milliner's to work, where I actually delivered millinery to all the major stores in Swansea, and I was there for quite a while.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:40.760
And I also can't even remember chronologically in which order it went.

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:46.760
And subsequently I went back to Addis a second time.

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:56.760
Now that wasn't until much later, because I actually left to join the army.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:05.760
And I went and did my basic training. I was only in the army a few months, because just before I went into the army, I'd met Margaret.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:17.760
And I decided to buy myself out of the army in order to continue, well, not continue, begin a relationship.

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:20.760
So I bought myself out.

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:26.760
And I went back there for a while to work.

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:33.760
And I left, when I left there, I left Swansea and went to live in Bridgend.

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:37.760
To live with Margaret, because she lived on her own in Bungalow.

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:39.760
But that took quite a long time.

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:51.760
I can remember going back and forth for something like 16 months between Addis, leaving Addis on a Friday, going to Bridgend for the weekend and going back to Addis on a Monday morning.

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:57.760
So I must have been there a fair while, because we met in February of 72.

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.760
No, we didn't.

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:05.760
We met in 1970, in November of 1970.

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:10.760
And I didn't move into Bridgend until February of 72.

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:14.760
So that period of time, again, I was working in Addis.

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:17.760
Right.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:21.760
So why do you think you went back there?

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:29.760
Was it, I mean, did you feel, did you feel happy there?

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.760
No, it's just a question of the familiar really.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.760
I knew exactly what I was going back to.

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:43.760
And I thought rather, because I had it in the back of my mind that wherever I went I wouldn't be there very long.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.760
I just thought, well, I go back to what I know.

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.760
The money's okay.

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.760
I know I can do the job.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:52.760
I'll stick it out there for a little while and see how things turn out.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:55.760
Why did you leave in the first place then?

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:58.760
I can't remember.

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:01.760
I just thought probably I wanted to change.

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.760
It was just, you know, familiar routine.

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:08.760
I just wanted to change really and do something different.

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:15.760
And did you enjoy these different things, like the milling as, as much as you enjoyed the factory?

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:16.760
No.

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:26.760
No, because I was working with them, two initially, and two women initially, and then one of them left to have a baby, and I was working with one other woman.

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:34.760
And it was kind of lonely in a sense after working with that huge crowd of people in a factory.

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.760
It was lonely in that sense.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.760
I had a female boss who was very kind to me.

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:43.760
But, and I've spent most of my time outside.

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:49.760
So that's part of the reason I left, I think, was because I was beginning to feel claustrophobic and enclosed really.

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:54.760
Being indoors for those number of hours every day, every week.

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.760
You're never seeing the outside.

00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:57.760
Never, you know.

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:03.760
I got a job where I spent a lot of my time outside because I was delivering millinery, so I was outside a great deal.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:09.760
Walking round Swansea really, different parts, and seeing different people when I was going to the stores to hand over the millinery.

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:12.760
I thought that would, you know, that would be great.

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.760
I worked in Wine Street.

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.760
The millinery was in Wine Street, and it was a really interesting area.

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:18.760
It was a red light district in those days.

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.760
Not posh like it is now, full of restaurants and clubs and bars.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:24.760
It was very interesting working there.

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:33.760
But, as I say, it was lonely after working with, I was working with one other person who wasn't exactly a joy to work with, looking back on it now.

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:36.760
So, yeah.

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.760
No, I did regret it actually.

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:39.760
Yeah.

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.760
What about joining the Army?

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.760
Why did you feel you wanted to join the Army?

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.760
God alone knows, Catherine.

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:46.760
God alone knows.

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:49.760
What I was thinking at the time, I have no idea.

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.760
Lots of my friends left.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:47:01.760
Two of my friends went to join the Army that I was in school with, and they said it was a very interesting, exciting life, and you know, why, what you do, why are you wasting your life doing those crap jobs?

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:02.760
Why don't you join the Army?

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:03.760
It's fun.

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.760
You'll have a great time, you know.

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.760
So, I think I was partly influenced by them.

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:13.760
One of the friends I was very close to in school, I continued to have a friendship with after she joined the Army.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.760
Two of my closest friends joined the Army.

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:20.760
I think I was influenced by them, and my father had been in the Army as well.

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:30.760
Not that he recommended it, because he hated the Army, but I think it was the two women who said to me, you know, it's much more interesting than working in a factory or a shop or whatever.

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:34.760
You know, there's so much going on, it's so interesting, you really enjoy it.

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:35.760
Yeah.

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:37.760
So off I went.

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.760
Okay.

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:54.760
So, can I just ask you, you said you'd started a relationship with your partner, Margaret, in early 70s, and you went back to the factory.

00:47:54.760 --> 00:48:08.760
Were you open about your sexuality, and if you were, or if you weren't, if you know what I mean, how were people's attitudes in the factory?

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:18.760
Well, I knew I was gay when I was in school, and people, you know, generally said everybody went through this phase where they had crushes on other girls, and they grew out of them.

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:22.760
And I thought, fine, that'll happen to me as well, but it didn't.

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:39.760
I had boyfriends, a number of boyfriends at the same time as it happened, but most of my friends had sex at quite an early age, you know, when they were still in their mid-teens and had babies subsequently, and I wouldn't have sex with boys.

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:41.760
I always refused.

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:47.760
And I had a bit of a reputation as being frigid.

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:55.760
I was told I was frigid, and, you know, I wasn't coming across, so I was frigid, there was something wrong with me, but I knew it was because I was gay.

00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:02.760
I just, I slowly came to realise that I was gay anyway, right through my teens.

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:15.760
And when I was, I mean, as far as the women were concerned, that was something they almost spat out, as though it was something disgusting and dirty.

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:26.760
I mean, if you told them that you were gay, I suspect not many of them would have spoken to me or got anywhere close to me in case, you know, it rubbed off on them by reputation.

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:30.760
It was a very different atmosphere in the 1960s.

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:40.760
Things were slowly beginning to change, but really it wasn't until the 70s that the major changes began, and attitudes began to change.

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.760
No, I never discussed it with anyone.

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:45.760
Even when you'd started a relationship?

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:54.760
Well, I had a relationship before Margaret when I was, I must have been around 20, I suppose.

00:49:54.760 --> 00:50:00.760
I met somebody who was a lot older than I was, and who was bisexual.

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:11.760
And she was much older, much more sophisticated, when she was 31, and I was, you know, I was green really, I was very young and naïve in many ways.

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:16.760
She'd got a degree at Sheffield University. She was highly intelligent.

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:24.760
And she was the first person, whoever, showed me any true respect that I didn't get any at home.

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:32.760
Because my brother was considered to be highly intelligent, which he was and still is, and I was considered, you know, to be average.

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:40.760
And letting the family down because I wasn't going out with boys and I wasn't getting engaged and I wasn't getting married and I wasn't having babies.

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:45.760
But she was the first person to ask me for my opinion on anything.

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:56.760
If we discussed things, you know, general things that were going on in the world and in society around us, social events and political events and stuff, and she would actually say, what do you think?

00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:00.760
I remember being absolutely gobsmacked the first time she said that to me.

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:04.760
What do you think about it? Have you thought about that? What's your opinion on it?

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:09.760
And I thought, my God, nobody has ever asked me for my opinion. Nobody.

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:16.760
So I was silent for a long time and I thought, I did think about things, but I never discussed them with anyone.

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:22.760
Because I was never asked. So she was the first relationship I had.

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:32.760
And that was going on when I was still working in the factory. So I was going to work and she was then working as a civil servant.

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:36.760
There was no way I could have discussed that with anybody.

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:42.760
And I mean, we broke up because she actually had a relationship with a married man while she was seeing me at the same time.

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:48.760
And I decided enough was enough really. And I basically packed it in because she became pregnant by him.

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:51.760
It's a long, complicated story.

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:56.760
He paid for an abortion and I was the one who went to the hospital with her, but we won't go there.

00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:59.760
I decided that was enough. Finished.

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:03.760
But there was no way I could have discussed that with anybody. I never discussed it with anyone.

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:06.760
I didn't have a single friend that I could discuss that with.

00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:08.760
So definitely not with anybody in the factory?

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:09.760
No.

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:11.760
OK. OK.

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:18.760
Looking back now, this is the last question.

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.760
Oh.

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:25.760
I just asked. You didn't go and work in any other factory after that, did you?

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:26.760
No.

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.760
So looking back now, how do you feel?

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:35.760
I tell a lie. I did. But that was after I moved in with Margaret. So that was in Bridgend.

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:37.760
And what factory was that?

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.760
Miles Laboratories, it was called.

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:48.760
If you can think of any household medication, any sort of familiar brand name that you can think of, they bottled.

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:54.760
So it was a line, it was machinery and it was a series of bottles that you had to fill.

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:58.760
How did that compare with Addis?

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:06.760
There was a lot less camaraderie there. A lot more focus on the work.

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:11.760
And no chatting. Because the machines were a lot faster and you had to keep up with them.

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:15.760
You didn't have time to chat to people. Except of course during your breaks.

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:20.760
I mean the conditions were much better. Extremely clean, extremely hygienic, much better facilities.

00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:23.760
Decent breaks, good money, blah blah blah.

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:30.760
But the camaraderie was virtually, I mean except during lunch breaks when you had an opportunity to chat.

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.760
It was totally focused on the work really.

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.760
And was that a smaller factory?

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.760
No, it was quite large.

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:38.760
Was that mainly women?

00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:39.760
Yes.

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:41.760
And what years, do you remember?

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:47.760
Well I moved in in 1972, so it must have been between 1972 and 1974 I worked there.

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:51.760
Right. And do you remember any social occasions, that kind of thing?

00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:55.760
Yes, it was a lot more sophisticated. We all went into Cardiff.

00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:59.760
A different world really.

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:01.760
And sorry, what was it called?

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:06.760
Miles Laboratories. I've got a feeling it's probably still there.

00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:09.760
Enbridge End Industrial Estate, it's probably still there.

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:17.760
And the conditions were good, so you were, do you remember how much you earned?

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.760
No, no idea.

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:21.760
But you were happy with the wage?

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:23.760
Yes, the money was fine.

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:29.760
Looking back then, how do you feel about the time you spent working in these factories?

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:33.760
Well it was very formative in a way. I didn't realise it at the time.

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:38.760
But it helped me get through some very difficult years at home.

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:47.760
And I formed some very close relationships really.

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:51.760
Which helped me through difficult times really.

00:54:51.760 --> 00:55:00.760
Generally, how do you think, generally for women, were they important places?

00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:10.760
Everybody there felt that. It gave them a sense of independence and also a sense of who they were as individuals.

00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:17.760
Because most of them were married with families and everybody related to them in that way.

00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:19.760
They were somebody's wife and somebody's mother.

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:22.760
But while they were in the factories, they were themselves.

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:25.760
And they got back in touch with their identity and who they were.

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:28.760
And they formed close relationships with other women.

00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:34.760
And I think they were able to be themselves in a way that they probably weren't at home.

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:38.760
It taught you a lot of things about yourself.

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:44.760
Forming relationships, being able to work as a member of a team.

00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:46.760
Things like loyalty.

00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:52.760
And I also learned to be discreet because a lot of people told you personal stuff.

00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:55.760
Which they trusted you with.

00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:58.760
Not necessarily anyone else.

00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:02.760
Maybe things they couldn't talk about even to members of their family.

00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:08.760
What about Addis? Do you think they were good employers on the home?

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:11.760
For the time they were.

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:13.760
Considering it was the early 60s.

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:15.760
What was the factory called by the way?

00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:17.760
Addis. Addis Limited, yeah.

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.760
And what about the other place in Bridgend Mills?

00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:23.760
Yes, they were probably reasonable employers as well.

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:26.760
They followed all the rules.

00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:30.760
They had no complaints about working conditions.

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:34.760
But you were expected to pull your finger out and work hard really.

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:38.760
Nothing major to complain about.

00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:41.760
Thank you very much Yvonne.

00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:43.760
You're welcome, that's okay.

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:48.760
I forgot to ask you this Yvonne.

00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:51.760
Were there any perks from working in the factory?

00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:56.760
Yes, you did get everything at a reduced cost.

00:56:56.760 --> 00:57:05.760
But every night when you left the factory you were at randomly searched by security.

00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:09.760
To make sure you didn't have anything on your person that you shouldn't have had.

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:12.760
So you had to go through a gate.

00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:14.760
And at random they just picked you out.

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:17.760
Went through your handbag, went through your shopping bag.

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:21.760
Quite often used to frisk you to make sure you didn't have anything on your body that you shouldn't have had.

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.760
So were any people caught?

00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:24.760
Yes.

00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:26.760
What happened to them?

00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:28.760
They were sucked.

00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:30.760
Oh yes.

00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:33.760
I don't think you had the opportunity to do it a second time.

00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:35.760
No.

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:36.760
Okay.

00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:37.760
Thank you very much.

00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:38.760
That's okay.
