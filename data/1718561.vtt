00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
Did you actually live in Abbecombe here itself, Jez?

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.960
Well, we lived, a family moved there, a McFather moved across there in 1951 to work,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.400
but we were still at that time living in Lannidlois.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.280
The family came to live there because the Forest Commission located or made a new house available

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.840
called the Forester's House, which is just below Combsgowan there on the road,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.360
as you're going up from the barn towards Bullsorner on the corner there, the White House,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.720
which has got the big chalet built next to it now, I think.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.600
So yeah, we moved there because my father got the post of Forester in charge, I think it was

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:51.040
or something like that, at the time for Coed Sarner Forest, that was just starting at that time.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.200
So we moved in then into that house.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
My parents stayed there till my father retired and I left there when I was about

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.520
18, I suppose just over 18, to go to university.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.920
So your father obviously worked for the forestry.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.120
Yes.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.080
Did your mother work or did she work in the home?

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.360
No, there wasn't much scope in there and she also had five children to look after.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.560
That was enough work then?

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.920
I had two brothers and two sisters.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.880
There were four of us when we moved in 1953, I think, and then the year later my

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.480
younger sister Karen came along.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.480
So I think given those days, when we moved into the house, there was no electricity there,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.640
of course. It was a modern house.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.280
It had gotten fully fitted out with gas lighting.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.520
Horrendous when you think about it now, but they had little light shade with two little chains

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.280
that you operated the valve to get the gas to go through the element that kind of

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.840
from the rest attracted the light for you.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.840
And was that a gas cooker, I assume?

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.160
But the house, when it had been built, it had been built with a wash house,

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.920
with a boiler thing in it.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.080
It was a cobbled house.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:23.200
And then there was the office next to that, which was the forest commission office.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.440
That was adjoined to the house at the time.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.720
And it was a small office there.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.760
And there was a telephone line.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.880
I think there was probably a telephone line there before the electricity came.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.120
Because when we moved, the electricity hadn't come to the abbey because the

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.880
abbey come here itself was powered by the light from the generator down by the mill

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.520
at the bottom.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:49.360
And those little posts with 24 volt DC or whatever it was that brought some lighting to the house.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.880
I think it came as far as the school.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.400
I don't think it went any further than that.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.520
I don't know if it came to come here.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.480
Some really rickety little posts that actually got the whole barrel wire.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.080
I don't remember those.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.280
Amazing.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:12.880
Yeah, it was quite a modern house, but limited by the private water supply and things like that.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.240
From a little valley up above.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.240
But every so many years we had to go and dig out and get all the silt out of it and things like that.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.520
But yeah, it was a lovely open air life.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.400
We used to spend all our time fishing in the river by hand usually and things like that with my brother.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.600
My immediately younger brother.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.520
My elder brother kind of went to be working probably by then.
