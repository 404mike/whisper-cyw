00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It's Stephanie Cruise of Ellen Links and today it's the 10th of November 2022 and I'm talking to Hugh.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Hugh, could you give me your full name and year of birth please?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Yes, I'm Hugh Rickards and I was born in 1964 so I'm 58.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Thank you very much. Now, back in August this year you visited Ellen Valley.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Can you tell me why you came and what your first impressions were?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Okay, yes, well I came from Birmingham as part of a group called the GOATS.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The GOATS stands for Getting On At The Shed, which is a group of people, it's an over 50s group based in our local park,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
who get together, we try to do good things and get interested in things and look after each other.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And we became interested in the Ellen Valley through your artist Kate Green,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
who was singing songs about the water pipe that links Ellen Valley to Birmingham.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And so as a part of our interest in that, we started talking with Ellen Links and that led to us coming up there for the weekend

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
to stay over at the bunkhouse and to see what was going on.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And back then, as you remember, there was very little water in the reservoir and it's a very different picture from what I guess it looks like today.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Yes, I think where the dams were ever flowing at the moment, we had some glorious weather back in the summer.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
How did you find the bunkhouse? How did you find Concrete?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Oh, it was beautiful, absolutely beautiful. It's in a great situation.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And of course, it's a dark sky side. So we had the help of some astronomers and their telescopes.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
We could see all sorts of things that I'd never seen before.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Dying stars and supernovas and galaxies and all sorts of things like that.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So, yes, it was very comfy and friendly and we were very well looked after.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We cooked our own food and did astronomy and had a little fire outside as well.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So it was just a great experience for all of us.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Good. And before your introduction to Cape Green, did you know where the water in Birmingham came from?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Absolutely. Well, as anybody who lives in Birmingham for any length of time knows,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000
there is an old and slightly dilapidated model of the Irland Valley in Cannon Hill Park, which is one of the major parks in Birmingham.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And, yeah, we used to go walking around this little model, which is probably about, I don't know, 10 yards square in the park.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
It's just a sort of miniature model of all the dams and the valleys.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So I think most people in Birmingham, probably because of that, we know where our water comes from.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
We know it comes from the Irland Valley and we know it comes from Wales.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Did you know how close the Irland Valley is to Birmingham?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I didn't really. I had a vague idea, I think. I had a vague idea.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And of course, now I know, thanks to Kate, it's 73 and a half miles because she sings about that in her song.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Yes, yes, that's right. And slightly uphill most of the way from Birmingham there, which is helpful for getting the water back the other way.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
It is. It is indeed. It is indeed.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000
You mentioned your community group in the park. Now, how did you actually get involved in GOATS?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Oh, right. Well, GOATS was my idea, myself and my friend Ian.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
We're just coming to our retirements. He's fully retired and I'm partially retired.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And we really wanted to set up a group in the local community that was for over 50s.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Initially, it was for predominantly men who were a little bit more likely to be socially isolated.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
But we have a mixture of men and women these days.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Lovely, lovely. And you do all sorts of activities, do you?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Yeah, we tend to do what the members want us to do.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
We spend a lot of time talking about things we might do and then we follow our interests.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
So we sometimes go on cultural outings to different towns and cities.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And we sometimes do countryside activities or crafty activities like blacksmithing or bicycle maintenance or scything.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Wow. And it's really whatever people in the group want to do.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000
We're also trying to develop the group to be a group that is a source of wisdom for the community as well.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So like a village elders sort of function. And we're working on that at the moment.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Nice. OK. You mentioned the weather back in August and it is slightly wetter here today.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
But of course, we're in Fort Hampton or Splendour at the moment.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So do you think you'd be tempted to come back to the valley?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Oh, definitely. I mean, we've got good we have good links with Elan Links now.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So, yeah, we want to just pursue and develop those.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:22.000
We are still I mean, there are a few bits and pieces of connections now because I think there's a plan to regenerate the Elan Valley model in Cannon Hill Park.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:31.000
We want to be part of that. We're also looking at the concrete posts.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I don't know whether you know about the concrete posts, which are which Kate walked around as you walked around the whole perimeter of the Elan Valley and did a photographic exhibition in Hereford.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Very recently, we all went to see.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And I think one of these concrete or one of the concrete posts, maybe one that hadn't been used, I understand it's in a shed somewhere on the site.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Kate's going to use as part of an exhibition in Birmingham.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And I think we as a part and cartridge part, we'd be quite happy to twin with the Elan Valley, even though we'd say the Elan Valley is slightly bigger than our part being, I think, one percent of the area of Wales.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And we're only a little part of about five acres.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
But we'd love to twin with you, I think.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
That would be a lovely idea.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
That would be really nice.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:33.000
I think things like your siding course could be used down here so you could come and help with some of the maintenance on the Elan Valley Trust and work alongside rangers and things.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
That's exactly the sort of thing we'd like to get involved with.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:51.000
The Cape Green project was wonderful because those concrete posts mark the watershed, which was the city council, so they're very historic items.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.000
But of course, there's a lot of Bronze Age and Iron Age and Roman features in the valley as well.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
So it is quite a special area.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:10.000
But do you want to leave me with any impressions that you've got from the valley, from your tour around the valley?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
What did you actually think of the place?

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:21.000
I mean, amazing. I suppose a really warm welcome from the people of the Elan Valley of all kinds.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Very warm welcome and absolutely breathtaking scenery and peace.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And the ability to have a swim in the river as well. That was fantastic.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
That's something I won't forget.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Oh, that's wonderful. Well, hopefully he will see you back in the valley fairly soon.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
It's been lovely talking to you today. I've no doubt.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And I'm most grateful for you adding to the story of Elan Valley.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
No problem. Anytime.
