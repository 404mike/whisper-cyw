00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
And as a Welsh woman, how did you feel about all this going on?

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.840
Oh, I loved it because I am, you know, I'm proud to be Welsh

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.400
but I'm also proud to be British as well.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.680
And do you remember

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.200
anything else going on in the community to do with...

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.520
Streeteas, yes, Streeteas, oh they were a must weren't they?

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.800
And not always

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.000
because some people in the street weren't really talking to some people further down the street.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.280
That did pose a problem in the street.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.280
Did you have a street party in your street?

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.600
Yes, yes, we had street parties, yes, yes.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.880
Some of them weren't that actual day, they were the day after.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.920
But yes, oh we had street parties for everything, you know, the Investiture, the Royal Weddings.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.560
Well, then I suppose, and it was a big thing, you know, it really was.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.920
We really loved it because it brought the community and the street together.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.480
So what would happen for this street party?

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.960
Well, someone, one or two of the ladies would get together.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.160
There'd always be a committee and it would be, there's a meeting in,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.000
I lived in Trie Herbert and there was a public house called the Castle.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.600
People then didn't, ladies didn't go to public houses.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.200
But they'd had a spare room and committee meeting there.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.240
Sometimes it worked, well it worked out very well on the whole, I'm sure.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.480
But oh yes, there were big scenes, you know, about the actual party and what was going to be,

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.840
well, the food and the organising of the event and everyone dressed up.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.920
And the streets were beautifully decorated, banners and greenery.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.520
And then people bringing out, well, bringing out a piano onto the street so that people,

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.720
yes, oh yes, so people could dance and they'd do, it's really great.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.840
You say dressing up, would it be party dress?

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.120
Fancy dress, oh definitely.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.800
Right, so what kinds of things did you dress up as?

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.440
Well, Britannia, obviously you had to have Britannia.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.240
Or loads of Welsh ladies bringing their Welsh cakes.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:25.040
Fairies, clowns and then of course you couldn't go to these shops now that sell all this party wear.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.600
It was what people made themselves.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.040
And very good effort, some of them made, I must say.
