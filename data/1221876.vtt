00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Can you tell me what being Jewish means to you? Can you answer that?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You see, I am a political Jew, I'm not a religious Jew.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I believe that the Jews went through a very, very difficult time, and I have an argument with my God.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I say to him that he didn't do it well, that he didn't behave well towards the Jews.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And particularly when I think of my friends in Prague who perished, and my family who perished, I said he behaved very badly.
