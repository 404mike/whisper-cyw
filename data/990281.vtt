00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
Well, the Venetians are taking a few of these phrases.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.000
And I'll just mention a few of these terms, if I may.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.920
In a word which is very often used in the Welsh is top,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.400
which is what I am for being up here.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.920
That means being silly.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.720
Oh, I've taken a real fancy to her, they go, and...

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.200
She was out there like a winky.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.600
These are terms which they use,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.400
and of course you have to understand these connotations.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.560
For example, it's the last thing I am now,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.560
but when somebody is excited, they say,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.560
Oh, he's over the moon, he is.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.560
Ha!

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.960
Shukum rynchid.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
A real blemmer.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.560
Waretig, waretig.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.160
We should be fair play in Welsh.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.160
These are words which cover the language here,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.360
catryl and gwa'dab and all the rest of it.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.760
The one with the kind of term which would...

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.360
One of the ones which I really take a fancy to is that

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.160
the kind of thing when somebody asks you,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.160
Oh, how's your sister?

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.960
Oh, very poor.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.960
She's under the doctor, she is.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.960
Ha!

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.360
It strikes me as a sure case of malpractice, eh?

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.360
Ha!

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.960
When a little boy was asked why he...

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.360
He was given some seeds by his teacher,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.560
and he was asked where he planted them, he says,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.560
Oh, I planted them down my gran's back.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.560
Ha!

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.560
This is not a reference to some senior citizens or manomy folks,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.160
it means that he's talking about in the backyard,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160
but this is the kind of language they have.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.960
God knows what happens when the local council comes and digs up gran's front.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.960
Ha!

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.760
There is...

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.760
There's also, you know, in the...

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.760
There's a lovely...

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.760
The language has got some lovely Welsh words in it.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.760
I wonder how many of you here remember the word, kuch?

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.760
Kuch.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.760
Kuch in Wales, in South Wales particularly, has four delightful meanings,

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.760
as John Edwards goes to some pains to explain in his tape.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.760
He says, kuch under...

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.760
Kuch, do you remember the kuch under the star?

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.760
Where you used to store stuff?

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.760
There's a lot of heads, not in a way, folks.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.760
There's the kuch it away, keep it safe.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.760
I used to say to the dog, remember, she was a faithful dog, kuch!

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.760
And the dog would come to heel.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.760
But you know, the most beautiful kuch of all

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.760
was when you used to kuch up to your man.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.760
Back in Wales, if you thought you were going to love folks,

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.760
you don't know what you've missed.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.760
In Wales, traditionally, I remember as a child,

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.760
whenever I used to fall and graze my knees,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.760
I used to come and kuch up to me gran.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.760
And kuching up to my gran meant you'd put in a shawl

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.760
and wrapped around, and there you were.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.760
Away from the world's worries and cares,

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.760
there you were, kuched up to your gran.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.760
Isn't that marvelous, wasn't it, eh?

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.760
That's why we've always grown up with a smile on our face.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.760
I must admit, when I got on into little life,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.760
I learned that you could kuch at other things too.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.760
There's also an aspect of wanglish,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.760
which is the gross overuse of a word.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.760
And one word which is grossly overused in Wales, of course, is tidy.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.760
A conversation which John Edwards gives in his tapes is of this nature.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.760
Or another one which he gives as well is but a gal being asked,

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.760
Tidy fellow, turn his hand to anything.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.760
Makes the mind a bottle of everything.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.760
But I'd like to break away from wanglish

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.760
because I'm of that peripheral region.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.760
My ancestors actually came from, my father and mother came from Carmarthenshire.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.760
And I was brought up to speak Welsh.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.760
In actual fact, I was hospitalized when I was six in Cardiff.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.760
I was there to find a nurse to translate from me because I couldn't speak in English.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.760
It's true, sorry, it's true.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.760
It's at the end of the part of Wales where I come from.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.760
I was born in a farm in North of Swansea.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.760
I was born in Swansea.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.760
You've almost got enough of a rugby side there, eh?

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.760
Just an aside before I come to the last things that I could do.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.760
The farm we had, another aspect of Wales,

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.760
is that I was born in Cwm Cille Farm and our name was Thomas.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.760
And therefore we went, Thomas Cwm Cille.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.760
But yeah, all around us was Thomas Maes de Mawr,

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.760
Thomas Blank Cille, Thomas Fon de Vidman,

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.760
Thomas Ardors, Thomas Gwysigrond, Thomas Gwysidur,

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.760
Thomas Gwysigrond as well.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.760
And you know, the incurious thing was, and really it's true honestly,

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.760
not one of us was interrelated and yet we were all Thomas'

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.760
and really it's quite phenomenal.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.760
Another local personage of Sir Stephen Wales,

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.760
actually a considerable Stephen Wales,

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.760
which we had was from a small village where I went to school,

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.760
Blackman Park, and he actually took his name,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.760
and this will give you the clue of what we were referring to,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.760
he actually took his name from the chapel where we went to as kids,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.760
and to Croes.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.760
Croes Williams was a local man, in actual fact his brother

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.760
used to repair the shoes for us, Thomas Williams the cleaver was a fellow.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.760
And to conclude here, I don't know, maybe Bob would ask me later to come up

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.760
and do a Wenglish tale for you, but I don't know,

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.760
depends how much of that rain year I get in the Alba.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.760
I do have one prepared, maybe later on.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.760
But Croes Williams wrote many lovely delightful poems,

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.760
and I'd just like to finish by reading one of them,

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.760
it's called William Treveen,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.760
and it refers to of course the passage in time of a lot of things in Wales,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.760
as there are in the West I suppose.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:50.760
I hope that he worked in Bali, Akanmali, Malirtele, and Treveen, till then.
