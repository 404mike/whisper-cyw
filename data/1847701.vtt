00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So today is the 26th of September 2019. This is Dr. Adiola Dowis. Can you say your full

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.200
name?

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.200
My full name is Carlton Peets.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.200
Carlton Peets. And where were you born?

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.200
St. Kitts, the best island in the Caribbean.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.200
And what is your birth date?

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.200
1611

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.000
What were your parents' names?

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:31.200
My parents was married to make a street. My mother was Vivian Peets. My father was Izzy

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.800
Gale Sutton, which is also my middle name.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.800
Izzy?

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.800
E-Z-K-I-E-L.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.800
Ezekiel.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.800
Yeah, just like in the Bible.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.800
Okay. And what did they do for a living?

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.400
Well, at the time there wasn't much job for their kind of education. My mother used to

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.400
be a king and my father cut them.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.400
Oh, okay. And did you have brothers and sisters?

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.400
Yes. Four sisters and one brother.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.400
And where are you in the...

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.400
In the middle. I'm the fourth out of the six.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.400
Okay. And what was growing up in St. Kitts like? What do you remember?

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.400
Well, growing up in St. Kitts, I was very, very happy. We have everything, sports, all

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.400
the... I mean, go to the mountain and do everything boys do.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.400
What was school like? Did you like school?

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.400
Oh, yes. Not at first. But first, when I started, I used to like going down to see water. And

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.400
once my sister came to look for me, that I didn't feel like going to school. And she

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:58.400
got a joy cane because we had a lot of sugar canes in St. Kitts. But one field was there

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.400
barren. And she took up one of those and every time she walked and she catch up to me, it's

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:14.400
a good thing. And unfortunately, my classroom was outside the school. I was in what they

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.400
call outside class, put it away. And when I turned around the corner, I saw my class

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.400
outside and I started drawing my eyes because I didn't want them to know that I got licks

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.400
to go to school. And then went in school, my sister knew the teacher and she said,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.400
I could tell you her name now, Clarice. She named Clarice Canes. And my sister said, Clarice,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.400
could you mark him present for me? She said, oh yes, I will. And then with this time, just

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.400
everybody else moving out, she called me back and she said, your sister didn't send you

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.400
her name. I said, who tell you so? And she said, and she put her hand across my forehead

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.560
and she wiped off the salt so that when you wipe off the salt, you know you was down the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.560
sea. Because he left his mark. And then she told me, I won't mention the words she told

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.560
me as a teacher, but she said, next time you run away from school again without any

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.040
permission, I'll startle myself. I mean that was nice, soft words she told me, but it didn't

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:46.040
like that she told me. But you did enjoy school. Oh yes, after that morning, first man in school

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:53.040
is me. First person in school from that episode was me. And Taylor reached seventh standard.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.680
Then I had a little, well I used to do what they call gardening and go to school. So my

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.680
boss was a white man, he named me Mr. Ball. This is after you left school? No, before,

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:24.120
while I'm going to school, go to work in the morning, well there's a little garden, just

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:31.120
water the plants and pick out any little weeds. Because if you pick out the weeds every day,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.160
you won't have much to do. So you water the garden and go to school in the morning and

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.240
after school you go back in the afternoon. Then the boss and the mistress fall in love

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.520
with me, so they give me everything. They used to treat me like their own son or children

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:56.520
because they had three children. So I was one of the Balls. Black Ball. Yeah, so. Okay,

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.880
so what kinds of things did you want to be when you grew up at that age? Did you have

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:11.880
any dreams? I didn't have much dream, but I know for a fact I wasn't going in the cane

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:19.400
field to work. That's for a fact. Because I always say if my mother weed them and my

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:26.560
father cut them, there's no place there for me. So. Did you see it as a very hard job?

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:34.240
Cutting the cane? Oh yes. Oh yes. And they were, they wasn't paid the right rate and

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:44.760
everything through politics and so on. And I'll tell you what, the man who was in charge

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.480
was a blacker man than me. All the days only black and black, but he was really black.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:58.480
And he was in charge of everything. Negotiation with the Prime Minister Robert Llewellyn Bratcher.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:10.400
Was Sunkist at that time very segregated? Yes, I will say yes because I mean you never

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:18.200
used to see black people working in a bank and so on. And if you want a high job, let's

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.720
say working down for government, you have to go to grammar school which was the high

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:29.760
school in the land at the moment. So unless you go to grammar school you know you can't

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:36.760
get a good job. So you just have to take the menial jobs what left. Was it easy for black

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:43.760
children to go to grammar school? No. No because I mean you have the, what's the name? The

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:55.200
what's it called? I can't remember exactly what you call it. But then if you're bright

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.320
enough and you could pass the entrance fee, the entrance fee is that your parents will

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:07.320
have to pay for you. Like me, I could have passed the entrance fee but my head teacher

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:15.360
Mrs. Williams went and asked my father which he could afford to because his cousin was

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:22.400
paying for one of his sons to go to the same school. And he said no. Why did he say no?

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:30.720
Well, just like most West Indian fathers, they forget their children just grew up. And

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:39.360
he said no. And he told Mrs. Williams straight, he's only my mother, but at that time you

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.360
know we used to talk like we were speaking. He said we're only my mother you know and

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:51.160
I can't do it. And she was a bit gutted. And like a friend of mine who was in the same

00:07:53.920 --> 00:08:00.920
class, he went to grammar school because he passed the, oh god I can't remember what

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:07.920
it is now. And a friend, the other friend of mine who was, he went to Convent School

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:14.040
and that one, one end up as an engineer and the other one was the chief accountant in

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:21.040
one of the banks in St. Kitts. And me, just left behind. So that's why as I said to you

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:28.640
early on, after I got that job and the man told me to go and sell myself, I said to myself,

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:35.640
no way, I'm not looking for more work, I'm not filling out nothing.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.080
What job is this? You mean the gardening?

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:48.080
No, no, it was just caretaker of the arms, caretaker supervisor, you know and then was

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:57.280
in charge of the cleaners and so on. But there again there was a lot of prejudice in that

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.840
as well too.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.800
So after you left school you got that job as an accountant?

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:11.800
No, well just before I came from St. Kitts to here, I used to work in the batter, batter

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.600
shoe store.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.600
Oh.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:21.600
Oh yes, as the, what's it called it now, the, of course, as a young man, I was a young

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:32.280
man. I used to make sure, go to pass the warrants and so on to get the shoes out, the

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:39.280
customs and things like that. And then I had somebody else, another friend of mine who

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:46.240
used to clean out the store. His name was Vernon Twelves, you know.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.000
So what was the decision to come to the UK?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Well, it was a tough decision. First that if it was left to my mother, I want to be

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:04.960
but through my sister was here, my oldest sister, I had a choice. She was going to send

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:13.880
for me and I could get a job down the health center as, what do you call him now, sanitary

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:24.440
inspector. I would have got that job because it was already earmarked for me. Yeah, because

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:32.440
through friends and so on and through us, I'm not, I was a nice boy growing up. My people,

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:42.440
well, some, I won't say friends, but elderly people who know the man, they tell him and

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:52.080
so on and a good word, very good word. So it was like this, which I would come first

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:59.080
at the end of the month. If the money come first, which I explained to the man in here,

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:05.400
Mr. Buchanan, he was in charge. Said, Mr. Buchanan, if the money come first before the

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:11.560
ending of the month, I'll be going to England. If you don't, I won't be going to England,

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:18.560
I'll take the job. And unfortunately or fortunately, the money came first. And then as I said,

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:26.560
it came to my sister. What were you expecting? What did you think of England before you knew

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:34.160
about it, before you came here? Well, be honest with you, you always say England, do this

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:39.320
England, is that an England? The East African women were saying England pay with gold and

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:46.320
streets pay with gold and all them sort of nonsense. But then when you look at the, some

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:53.320
of the West Indian readers, what they used to send for us. You see cows going up pushing,

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:59.520
pushing cow up the ladder instead of going up on the roof to cut the grass. Well, I mean,

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:06.520
as Barber said, there was fooling us. And then they get some other West Indian book,

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:15.520
I think it's visual English books and that was a different scenario to the old West Indian

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:23.080
books. So in school they were actually teaching you propaganda? Well, that was the English

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:29.800
teaching. And you were still a colony, Sunkets were still a colony? Yes. So when you came

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:35.800
over, you were on a British passport? That's right. So you were British? British, yes.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:42.800
Well, I still put down British up to now. And how did you travel? Did you come by boat

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:49.800
or by boat? Both. I flew from Sunkets to Antigua, from Antigua to Trinidad. And then

00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:01.560
we caught the boat in Trinidad. It was about a good 20 of us from Sunkets that day. A woman,

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:07.080
she had about six children with her and me and my friends and so on. Do you remember

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:12.920
the boat? No, I can't remember it. I tried to look for it at Scania or something like

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:19.920
that, but I can't remember it rightly so I won't tell you. Do you remember the journey?

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:27.920
Well, the most I can remember is when we were in Trinidad. We had a good time in Trinidad.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:35.280
As boys, you know, we went up and down the place. And because there was a few more boys

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:42.960
joined from Dominica, they were from Dominica with us in Trinidad. So, you know, boys will

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:51.520
be discussing as usual. And you used to have some good times. This woman on the boat, she

00:13:53.840 --> 00:14:00.840
could speak Spanish. So everything we want, we ask her. Well, she knew me as well and

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:08.240
she knew my parents. So you only ask her to feel like chicken today, feel like fish today

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:15.240
and she will order whatever you ask her to. So the boat, the crew was Spanish speaking?

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:22.240
Yes, but they could speak English as well. Okay. And do you remember anything else about

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:27.640
the journey? Was it a happy journey? Well, as I said, it was happy because some of us

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:33.440
were, especially this fellow from Dominica, I mean, we were supposed to be, let's say,

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:39.080
on the lower deck. He carried me all up on the top deck and everything and foolish me

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:46.080
for him. Even though we were wrong or not supposed to be, we were still going. So before

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.560
I came up here, you know, I was discussing it. How long were you? How long were you?

00:14:53.560 --> 00:15:00.560
I can't even remember. I think around that. Around 20 years old? Yeah. And when did you

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:10.360
come? So what was it like when you arrived? Well, we went to Madrid. We landed in Madrid

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:18.400
in Spain. And my friend is leaning over the railing for the ship because I leave from

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:26.120
Spain to come to Cardiff by train. But leaning over the railing, you see people. Oh no, for

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:35.800
now from Spain, we leave from Spain to Southampton. And then you see some people, when the Spanish

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:42.800
women, well, I mean, they were more or less dressed in black as well. And when you see

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:50.440
them speaking, you see steam coming out of their mouth. So when I tell my friend, look

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:58.920
at them, steam coming out of their mouth, he says, you too. I said, you too. So you

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:05.920
came in winter perhaps? Yes, it was in February I came here. What were you wearing, do you

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:11.200
remember? Were you ready for the weather? No. Funny enough, I had a cardigan that I

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:16.400
brought from home because that was only for style, really, because in the West End you

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:23.400
don't need them. So luckily I wore it. What color was the cardigan? I think roughly was

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:36.400
red and black. Red, white and black. Yeah, white was up here, red up here, white in the

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:44.400
middle and black down here. Could always remember that. So what was your first impression of

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:50.400
Britain? So you saw the coal coming out of the mouth and when you step out, what was

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:57.400
it like for you? Well, we stay on the ship and then we came to Southampton and then we

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:04.400
land in Southampton. Well, me, all on my own. I don't know nobody. So I asked a man, look,

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:13.400
he was very polite and kind and he said, oh, I'll go up the rail and drop you up the

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:20.400
road. Well, on hindsight now, I think I was taking a chance because I don't know the people,

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.640
I don't know the place, so he couldn't go anywhere with me or whatever because he was

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:32.200
a man, he was a boy. So, you know, took the chance but I mean everything worked out to

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:39.200
the end and he said, if you don't know what to do, ask any one of them people, they in

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:46.200
black, like the porters on the railway. And then? Then come to Cardiff. How come you came

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.200
to Cardiff? Is that where your sister was? Yes. And why did she come to Cardiff? Why

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:59.200
Cardiff? Well, I thought, my home father is one half pay for her, so when they say half,

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:07.200
I wouldn't like to elaborate too much on that part of it. But let's say for convenience

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:14.200
sake, my father sent four. Okay, and he was here already? Yes. Okay, so you already had

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:22.200
a crew waiting for you? No, nobody was waiting for me. I had to find my way from the train

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:29.200
station to South Church Street. You know where South Church Street is? What was that like?

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:41.200
Well, then on my way almost out of the train station, my brother and brother-in-law turned

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:50.200
up. So they helped me. We walked down the back canal, you know, and then come down the

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:59.200
back. And then the first person I met was a friend, a fellow. He was much older than

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:10.760
me. And he used to, when we were in the grammar school, we played sports and so on. And Sunday

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:20.840
school time coming up, and we don't go. He'd call us. Come on, you had to go Sunday school,

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:28.480
because Sunday school. But then when I look, the man had a big long cigarette in his mouth.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:35.480
I said, well, cook, you don't do names like that. As a Christian, he said, boy, it's a

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:42.480
different story over here, you know. Was he from St. Kitts as well? Yes, yeah. Well, and

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:50.480
he was a good cook eater too. And then more or less, you could say I learned from him.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:03.960
Did you find the transition easy? So you came to Butown? Yes. Did you find the transition

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:10.960
easy from, besides the weather, from St. Kitts to Butown? Yes, because I mean, almost not

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:17.960
good. It was okay for me, because nobody really used to bother me or something like

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:25.600
that. And I had a friend. His brother was here as well. Well, you might know him, what

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:32.600
we call Dexter. Well, many grew up from the same village. And so I had a, you could say

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:40.360
a friend, so we could correspond with each other.

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.760
What was Butown like at that time? So you didn't have to go to school at that age? No.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:51.760
What did you do? I had to work. Soon as I came, I had to get the first job. But as I

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:58.760
said, I won't go into the details, because it might be embarrassing for somebody else.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:05.760
Okay. So roughly, was it easy to get a job? At the time, no. The most jobs you'll get

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:12.760
are factory jobs, because my brother-in-law was working down the post office. I applied

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:21.120
for a job down there, and they told me they'll let me know. I'm still waiting for them to

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:28.120
let me know. About a year or so ago, I found a letter, but in vexation, I ripped it up,

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:36.120
I think. The guy said, look, they're supposed to let me know, and they're supposed to be

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:43.120
this and that. So. Was it like that? Was that a common thing? Going for different jobs and

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.640
them saying they'll get back to you and not getting back to you? Well, as I said, I didn't

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:54.640
have too many jobs, but those that I really went for, I got. So, I mean, first job I refused.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:04.320
Was a place named John Williams over East Mores, and the place they wanted me to work

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:10.720
where they had vacancy is a place they call Knockout, the Knockout. The Knockout is like

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:17.720
a furnace. I just come from the West Indies, I'm hot already. I mean, let's say up there

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:26.200
in the center, the furnace down here, and I'm sweating. I said, no, thanks. And then

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:33.800
when I went to a place named Super Oil Seals, got a job there. Then after about 11, 12 years

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:45.560
or so, I pack up Super Oil Seals and went to the skill center. We learned welding. And

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:52.560
after about a year or so, place over there, my sense, they used to make radiators and

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:04.800
they fold up. So then I was working for nearly three years. And then, as I said, I used to

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:11.800
come to the center often, and the aviator named John Winslet, this morning, he sent

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:24.600
an application in the Western Mail, and he got one for me. And he called me and he told

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:31.600
me, here, as I said to you before, here you are now, go and sell yourself, fill out the

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:38.080
form. And after filling out the form, I said, Mr. Winslet, could you look at it for me and

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:43.080
see? He said, why, no. Because if you make a mistake, you're going to say it's true me,

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:50.080
but you ain't get the job. And as I said to you, the only form, I mean, internally in

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:57.280
this council, because of the housing department, I did apply for different jobs. And I passed

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:05.280
them, but especially the last one was to be like the, what's it called, over Nelson House

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:21.280
here. And after the lot, well, you might know some university people did apply as well too,

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:28.280
but some of them was too qualified. So I got the job, because of the rest who left,

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:36.640
I had the best specification of the rest. But what you think happened? My boss, she

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:44.720
named Blondwin Lloyd, she gave it to one of her friends. And she said, I'm going to

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:58.380
picks me up from Bethesda health hospital, checked there〜now. Not only I connected to

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:05.380
a computer, it was my wszystko, I was busy. And I got up, it was minutes before the weekend,

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:16.520
10 or 11 o'clock, in the morning, three hours before the route came up, I had a call from

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:22.960
said, oh, you got a watertight case. That's no problem. Come back and I told my wife.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:32.720
And she started crying. And she said, oh, we might have repercussions and all these

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:37.920
other things. And then what's going to happen to us and this and that. So I said, all right,

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:46.320
no problem. I just continued to work. I forgot about it. Then the person who got the job,

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:53.520
you might know her. She lives in Hodges Square, Washington, you know,

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:59.760
in Clay's Moose. Anyway, she got the job. And the woman, Kooni, said spell

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:07.560
con sage. And she asked me. And she was supposed to get my job. So this is other.

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:22.160
And then I had to play the same housing, same manager, Blowing Light, to do the cashier.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:27.760
Because, you know, you pick up rent and so on. And she turned me down. She gave it to another

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:39.680
fellow, which is white. And that white person turned around, teased him when he run. And then

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:52.360
she got another student. And student went to university. And when the student is

00:26:52.360 --> 00:27:03.040
absent, if she don't come in there, she'll ask me to go to cashier desk until one day.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:10.680
I decide enough is enough. And when she asks me, I won't tell you what I tell her. I could tell

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:17.680
you privately, but I won't tell you now. So working was always a bit of a challenge

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:24.600
in terms of finding the rights. You said you got married. You used your wife from Sinkitz as well?

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:36.280
Well, you could say, yes, Sinkitz Nevis. Well, she born in Nevis, but she went to Sinkitz to live

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:42.280
with her father. But I didn't know until I come here. So there was a big Caribbean community here at the time?

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:51.280
Oh, yes. Yes. A lot. Well, what they told me that is the council move them out, put them all,

00:27:51.280 --> 00:28:00.520
when they start developing the docks, they put them all different estates and so on. Like a lot went

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:07.800
to Ely, some went to Land Army, some went to Trowbridge and so on. Because that side developed

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:13.800
before the docks area. I think you might know some of that already.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:23.160
Okay. All right. So in terms of the challenges you faced being here so far, so you had the ones with

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:30.240
work, you know, were there any other main challenges that you experienced being here to where you are now?

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:41.520
I don't know how to explain that. But I know, well, I was lucky in a sense because we form a cricket

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:48.840
team because when they came here first, they had a Bajoran cricket team they called Spartans. And at

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:58.080
the time, well, you could see in my photograph, I was skinny. And when they were playing some,

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:06.080
let's say a side, I mean the team or the club had picked two sides. And this fellow left them

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:15.920
and went to play for somebody else. But he was a Bajoran. And the fellow looked around and he

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:23.200
said, I look the smallest. He said, I'm serious. Now he tell me go off the field. And then me and

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:32.960
my brother-in-law came up. And as I said, we live in South Church Street. And, you know, it was right

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:39.760
by the church. This club named Spartan, not Spartan, Combine was having a meeting because they were just

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:49.200
farming as well. And went in there and they invited me with open arms and I went and we joined

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:57.760
that. And I played for Combine and we got a few more kitties and so on because it was

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:07.840
more or less kitties who were farming. And then we get a good side, put it away. And we used to

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:17.280
beat everybody. And then we didn't have much more challenges. So some of us broke away. And then we

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:30.320
had a better team then, a better club. We called it Progressive. And Progressive was a team we know

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:38.240
from St. Kitts. That's why we gave it that name. And some of the Bajorans who was in

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:49.360
the club, the Spartans and so on, came and joined us. And well, I was the club secretary,

00:30:50.480 --> 00:31:00.240
treasurer secretary. And I was lucky enough. I met another, I think she born here,

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:09.040
she come from St. Kitts Little. Sure you might know, Donna Lyburn. No, she's in London now.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:16.000
She used to work, well funny enough she and my wife used to work in David Morgan's.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:24.640
And then she went and she started working for the Bay, Cardiff Bay, you know that. And

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:34.800
every year used to get grants for the cricket club and so on. So we was, you could say successful.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:43.440
And then I was the first black man that got to say please get a cricket pitch

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:49.920
for our club. It overfits Allen.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:32:01.920
The head of Cardiff Bay at the time was a man named Mr. Inking. And Mr. Inking did like cricket

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:08.880
so he used to go down there and we talk and talk and talk and you know he get his people

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:18.000
who used to work in Victoria Park. You know they do gardening and so on. And they fix up the pitch

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:29.520
first and then some people you know at the parts of the club think they know it all.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:36.800
And when they start saying they know it all, I leave it all to them and I pull away.

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:44.080
But as I said you could say from the trophy when we when we joined the cricket club we joined

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:53.600
Cardiff Midweek League Division 4. And every year we promote from four, three, two,

00:32:54.240 --> 00:33:00.080
till we become the champions. Even before we become champions we was beating the champions.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:08.480
And then we joined the Morgana Cricket League and they put us Division 5.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:19.520
And we work ourselves right up to champions as well. So we had a good good successful local

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:26.960
cricket team. And he said we used to have two and three trophies every year.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.240
You played cricket in St. Kitts before you came here?

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.600
Well not at this not on that scale.

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:43.280
You know I mean we mostly used to play with tennis balls and then rubber balls.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:51.200
So and then a little bit of this kind of cricket but not on a high scale.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:57.360
How important is it do you think or how important was it to have something

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:04.160
like a community that you did something with and excelled in? How important was that for you?

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:13.360
Very important. I feel very nice. But up to now with the centre we had a lot of lot of problems.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:25.280
Because well as you know we used to play home and away. And people used to get jealous because we

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:31.120
get jealous because we used to bring at one time I had about seven or eight coaches come here.

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:38.480
Right and they used to say it's a West Indian centre.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:43.520
So we had problem with the local. It's a really the local

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:49.920
councillor at that time and the local people.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:59.040
So we had a lot a lot of problems and from cricket you could say to dominos we're still having

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:04.960
problems. Because if you notice a lot of the people and I mean I don't have to spell it out for you

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:13.840
you know that they're really thinking what domino domino gets and that's fair. But we are the ones

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:19.200
who are supporting the place all the time. I mean if you go out there now you'll see more

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:26.960
domino people out there using the place. I'm not saying we spend all the a lot a lot of cash but

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:34.800
at least we're always here. And sometimes we spend more cash than he said for a hundred and I'm coming.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.880
Than he said for a hundred and I'm coming.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:52.560
Yes. Oh it's ongoing. I remember they had um one fellow who used to play for us his name

00:35:53.120 --> 00:36:01.360
Ghulam. He was from South Africa. He was a nice player and he was a nice nice fellow educated fellow.

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:09.520
And they form because black people was getting so much problems they find a black alliance.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:16.240
And they had that on the youth center used to be just across you there by the paddle

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:25.360
in the grounds of the two the highways flats there. It was right down to the end

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:32.880
because they were my welcome after that. And they had a meeting in there. Right.

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:43.120
And they called the counselor and the counselor tell them or tell this one fellow to go back

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:48.080
from where he come. The counselor said that. Yeah.

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:56.640
Well I don't know I'm not sure if she was the counselor at that time but she became the counselor.

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:05.360
So do you feel even though you had lived here for such a long time since you were 20

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:13.040
that you were still always an outsider. Yes. Do you still feel like an outsider. Yes because I mean

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:20.000
because of being people I'll tell you something. I mean a few years when I was running the bar

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:29.200
this fellow came in. He lived he used to live in Angelina Street and he was a big thing.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:36.800
He came here a bit tipsy and when you tipsy as a barman you're not supposed to sell people more

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:42.960
alcohol. And he called me. I won't put it on there but an outsider.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.600
And I must go back where I come from too.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:58.080
And one night the same man he fell down out in the car park. That time we had a little car park out

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:03.360
there. Don't know if you remember the center before it broke down. He was a little boy. He was a

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.600
little car park out there. Don't know if you remember the center before it broke down.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.960
But anyway there was a car park there and who had to pick him up.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.360
You know so these are the other things.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:23.120
What I didn't want to tell you yet when Chalky White was running the

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:28.160
youth center. Yes of course when I got married

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:36.480
he helped me to arrange everything like what I call it

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:47.440
wedding lunch or whatever you want to call it. So it was the reception.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:55.360
And he do everything for me and so on. I just get the goods and everything. And

00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:01.360
like how we used to work here then the brewery gave me a keg of beer.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:14.000
And I had a lot a lot of about at least 12 cases of beer from the ship from the West Indies because

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:23.280
some of them we used to go down barry and pick them up and some rum and so on. So we had a very very

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:31.440
we had a very very good thing. We had so much and a friend of mine cooked the curry

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:37.360
and everybody coming back for more curry and he called me I said I ain't got no more.

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:46.960
Right he named Wilmot and we had so much booze that we went back the next day the Sunday

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.280
and we were still drinking.

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.280
Chalky White was from Jamaica? Yes.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:01.280
So basically the West Indians that came you know after the World War II

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:11.840
really kind of did significant stuff in the space. Yes well nearly all as far as they understand it

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:17.760
nearly all West Indians who come to Cardiff branch off from in the Bay.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:26.560
Nearly all as far as I know I mean the oldest one might come and go different here is if let's say

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:34.480
for instance me and my children come to me now that I'm living we are living now. That's why

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:40.880
they won't have so much connection with the Bay. But nearly everybody had connection from the Bay.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:47.520
Do they all live in one area? Like people from different communities live in certain streets?

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:54.240
Yeah well yes some might live in let's say a lot of people as far as I hear was living South

00:40:54.240 --> 00:41:00.240
Church Street some live in Hodges Square some live in Angelina Street, Christa in the street

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:06.880
and some of the houses that they broke down what they call them now like

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:18.720
the Suffolk Street and so on you know. They live all in different areas in the docks.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:23.360
You said before you left home you would not have left if it was up to your mother.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:30.320
Did you get a chance to go back home? Oh yes oh yes oh yes well

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:39.360
well before I left and we went back home I had to that's why God blessed me.

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:48.320
I have to make sure at least once a month I send make sure my mother gets something.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:57.360
Every month at least she shows something sometime once or twice a month. I'll tell you something

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:08.560
now my mother died in 86. I had 30 pounds to send for her. I didn't get to send it and make

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:16.160
a guess what I done. You kept it? Yes I kept it but I put them in a frame

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:24.480
and I tell anybody else don't spend that money otherwise you spend the last of your life.

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:33.520
I'm serious because that money is for my mother or was for her and I could bring the photo

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:38.880
could bring the frame I'll show you. The 20 pound note and the 10 pound note.

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:49.600
Yeah them big ones and in the frame and that was my mother's money. You were very close to your

00:42:49.600 --> 00:43:00.960
mother. Oh yes oh yes as I tell you everything was the only pardon me well my sister the oldest two

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:07.760
sisters helped me out a lot well that's why some people say no wonder you spoil and you can't cook.

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.920
Did you ever feel homesick?

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:23.920
Well no not at the moment because nearly every year since I catch my feet I go so I ain't got no time now but sometime a year I feel it too. I feel like I'm ready to go back.

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:28.720
Yeah did you ever think you were going to retire in this country or did you think you would retire?

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:35.920
I didn't really didn't really come across my mother. I was very close to her.

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:41.840
Didn't really come across my mind. God telling me was going so fast you know.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:54.320
I'm curious about the identity thing so you came over as British yeah and then when you kind of came

00:43:54.320 --> 00:44:00.320
into Utah which has its own very kind of strong identity you know you were made to feel an outsider

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:05.520
and you were definitely West Indian right? Oh yes I will never give up that. How do you feel now do

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:14.720
you feel? No way I feel no way whatsoever. You're West Indian? Yes and I will never change that. Did you ever really feel British?

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:23.200
No no because I mean people tell me after all these years I haven't changed my accent.

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:32.000
I don't know if that went through to you but because people you know you go places and they say

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:41.280
where you from? I said I know just like that to here. I ain't giving it up for nobody

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:48.160
because I make sure I got to sign his name his passport as well and my purchase passport.

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:55.280
When did some kids get independence? 1983 19th of September.

00:44:55.360 --> 00:45:03.600
We went to West. Normally the service is in West Minister Abbey but they said they had it in another church

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:12.560
St. Mary's Abbot. Had what celebration? No not the celebration but the church service.

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.680
I went just last week. Last Thursday. To commemorate the independence? Yeah.

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:27.920
And I'll go that every year if possible while I have worth in my body. Why is that important to you?

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.920
It is important because my island

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:36.800
and I ain't giving it up for nobody.

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:47.280
I may not be let's say a millionaire to go back and spend all the cash but at least I go back there

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:54.720
and spend whatever little I have and I just like my little island. I don't know.

00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:08.320
Okay I have another question for you. Yes. The young 20 year old yeah who came over

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:18.240
on that boat all those years ago. If you had to give him advice based on the experience that you've had

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:28.000
what advice would you give him? Well put it this way I would have think my life different

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:38.160
because I would have gone instead of going up and down the place I'll try get a better education

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:44.160
educate myself a bit better and going to real estate.

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:50.800
Yeah that is the job I think I would have liked.

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:58.080
So you would have told him to just settle down and focus.

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:07.920
Mm-hmm. Oh yes. Well when I was going to buy a house in Corporation Road

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:19.200
my wife told me don't do it because obscene is like how to call a milestone around your neck

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:25.840
or something like that so I listened to her but then I said to myself

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:36.800
I want something and when I went we are living now to buy it she said I thought I'd tell you

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:42.880
we want a house now I said tell you something Mrs. the only thing you could do is divorce me

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:45.360
because you're going to buy the house

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:51.120
and I should have done the same thing in

00:47:54.640 --> 00:48:01.840
Corporation Road and when when I bought the house and start paying for it and everything

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:06.240
she couldn't thank me more. No I'm serious

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:12.320
because I explained to her we must have something to fall back to

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:19.040
so we may not be strong and all these other things all the time so we have to have something

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.720
and then after you see a bit of common sense

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:29.680
but that is one time I was determined to do what I want.

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:35.120
To follow your gut as well. Yeah.

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:43.360
So have you any regrets besides? Well I won't say regret

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:51.200
because I'm glad I came over here because I could afford at the time to make sure I sent something

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:59.440
for my mother but the only thing I always think into myself and I wouldn't know and I don't

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:06.000
think nobody would know for me what would happen to me if I stayed in St. Gates.

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:15.760
I'm serious I would let you know what would happen whether I might just start good

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:22.960
and upon drugs or well I never used to smoke cigarettes and I never start and I ain't

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.440
starting now but you know

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:32.080
different things because when I go back I see some fellows have things.

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:40.000
I didn't expect them to have it because at the time I'm not bossy but I was a bit more clever

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:49.040
than them but then I don't know how to come about it because I have a nephew right he's taken three

00:49:49.040 --> 00:50:00.560
planks not two and he had a car right you know I don't know if you ever see the film Night Rider

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.840
Kitty he had one similar to that

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:16.400
so you tell me so I might be following him down the road or whatever it is because I know

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:24.720
my friend he had quite a few houses up to now is my good good buddy when I go back there we talk

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:33.840
and everything and he had a he had a few work all buses he used to charge when people charging

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:40.480
two and three dollars he charged one any stock if you're going from here to the shop is a dollar

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:46.880
if you're going from the shop or from here to be to the bottom of the road or whatever it is

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:55.200
still a dollar and he make a lot of money so I could be following him as well because as I say

00:50:55.200 --> 00:51:05.120
it's my good spot but then he get caught up in drugs such big time because I could remember one

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:13.920
time I went home and he and I was speaking and he tell me the um the police read him and they had a

00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:24.320
lot of American dollars a lot of thousands of US dollars from him they confiscate his money he got

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:35.600
drugs and then once another time he bring a lot of money and he get married and his wife he thought

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:40.880
he's putting the money in his wife name and she's confiscate she won't have any money

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:50.240
and now after all that he still come and have all these things so as I said I could

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:56.400
become my nephew was involved with him so I don't know how I would have fear

00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:06.160
do you know these um these stories of people's experiences everyday stories everyday people

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:12.240
talking about their experiences and particularly migration and belonging and

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:17.040
and how you feel and to your identity how important do you think they are for

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:24.240
the younger generation you know like your grandchildren well I know for a fact my daughter

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:31.040
well I don't know how they how they view it now but some of them you're going to get into

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:37.280
conversation with them and they express their feelings and so on but I know my daughter for a

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:44.240
fact when she's in any form when they tell him about ethnicity and they're sticky and all them

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:48.240
artists she said she all she do is put down welch and black

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:56.240
you know they in no Caribbean nothing and so on she where she born here so she's welch and she's

00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:01.360
black she ain't going around a lot of formalities and all them sort of stupidness

00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:08.560
so you think it's important that um your grandchildren and great-grandchildren

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:14.480
know your story or know stories like yours do you think it's important for Wales well

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:21.040
well I hope the tradition goes on let them know where the roots are

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:29.840
because as I said and I'll keep telling you I ain't giving up my little island for nobody

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:38.000
so that's my where I come from my mother as I said

00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:42.720
suffer a lot of hard time I mean

00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:52.080
I remember one time my mother working on this stage and

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:58.800
she sent me for her money she said everybody know you so

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:07.920
when I went the pain pain pain now I may hear my mother name call yet so I went to the um

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:18.240
the overseer because he was there too so I said my mother said well I'm not so polished like now

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:22.080
I said my mother sent me for she money and me here she name call

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:28.640
you say boy go go away from me you're gonna not get no money this week

00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:35.600
and from that water start coming down my eyes because I mean

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:38.480
she ain't getting the money what happened to us we ain't gonna get no food

00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:43.760
and I went to him and he said

00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:51.600
ma the man sent the money for you this week and I see my mother start to cry you know

00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:58.240
and that make and you want to tell you I won't go into the details here but we'll tell you off

00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:06.240
camera and so on so my sister told me the reason why because my mother won't tell me

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:19.760
and it's only about my sister died last year that's 18 about 19 I mean 2017 she told me the reason

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:24.720
she told me the reason they won't tell me

00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:28.100
so

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:37.600
yeah so we meet some hard time but you see the only good thing with that my mother was a good cook

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:43.920
she'll take two potatoes and three yam and a dashing and so on and make something tasty out of it

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:55.680
it yeah so that's that's why you couldn't starve
