00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
but I am just a exports

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now, paper for a veil,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
for a veil

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
overflow him I come,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
over characters

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I tell you my love and call it now,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
When all my heart shall plead,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
There must no longer be

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The proudness of mine,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The past I knew.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The providence of hell,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The wondrous art,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Thy open vision shows

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
That loving heart,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Thou watchest for the earth,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And guide us on above,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Who, filling all commands,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Shall guard it above.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I could never see,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
But oh, I hear,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Thy thoughts of my own heart,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And hear them hear,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Without thought of mine,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And hear not it well,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
This army of the blind,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
To draw it's head.
