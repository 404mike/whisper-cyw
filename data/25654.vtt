00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Track 3. Owen Glyndwr. The last true Prince of Wales.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
You are standing on almost the highest point of Glyndwr's way, one of three Welsh national

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.200
trails. The 135 mile route runs in a horseshoe shape and is completely contained in the county

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:29.280
of Powys. Owen Glyndwr, after which the trail is named, was the last native Welsh person

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:36.840
to hold the title Prince of Wales. His hero status was assured after an ultimately unsuccessful

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.560
but long running revolt against English rule of Wales at the start of the 15th century.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:49.720
His revolution led to the liberation of North and Central Wales in 1401 and he was at nearby

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.380
Manedd Hyfgen to the west and he led his small army to the first major victory in the field

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.620
later that year. In response, King Henry IV issued anti-Welsh legislation designed

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.820
to re-establish English dominance in Wales. All it did though was push many more Welshmen

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.860
into rebellion. In 1408 however, nearby Harlech and Aberystwyth

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.900
castles had fallen to the English King and to avoid imprisonment he fled. Yestin Thomas,

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.140
community and wildlife officer for the Wildlife Trust, believes that like many Welsh folk

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.840
heroes he will return in the nation's hour of need.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.280
Legend has it that he's still lying hidden somewhere up in the hills waiting for the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.700
day that come the revolution Glyndwr will rise again and lead us all to defeat the English.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.460
It's probably that he died up in the mountains but the romantics of it, being Welsh, it's

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.300
no, he's still there, you know, coming the revolution one day, you watch out you English,

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.540
you better watch his step, especially when you come into mid Wales.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.560
Turn right and head down the track until you reach a wooden gate with a cattle grid to

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.800
its left. Do not cross the grid or go through the gate, this is your return route, but instead

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.700
follow the rutted track right. After a few yards you reach a small carpark with interpretation

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:26.420
panels. This is the Wildlife Trust Glass Lin Reserve Carpark. Listen to track 4 in front

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.740
of the Glass Lin Reserve interpretation panel.
