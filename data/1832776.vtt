00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.560
in March of 1941. I was 16. And between March the 13th and March the 14th I

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:21.200
became an enemy alien. I had to register at the police and somewhere I might still have this.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.840
I don't think I have. Anyhow I had this photograph, a little grey aliens registration

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:37.520
book, which showed how cold and chill bling-witten I was at the time. You see, to me, I wasn't a refugee.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:46.560
To me, I'd come here. What they thought was their problem. When I went to this police station,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.960
I suppose it was fortunate that it was in Wales because they made light of it. So I mean I just

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.280
knew it hit people. And again it was something that happened like bad weather. You know, you just

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.120
took it and I got this card and the Welsh police were all sweet. You know, it didn't,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:12.000
I don't think it impinged a lot. What impinged was something much deeper than I was coping with

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.520
by saying to myself, I'll show them who I am.
