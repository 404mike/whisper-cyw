Nan Teulaihth and Tinnepant Farms

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Nan Teulaihth Farm lies on the west side of the Cymr to Glyncorrug Road.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It takes its name from the Teulaihth stream, which divides it from the Tinnepant Farm on the north side.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The stream was so named because of the appearance of the thick milky water that flows into the Corrug River.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Teo is the Welsh word for thick and llaihth means milk.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Nant translates to stream, meaning nan teulaihth literally means the stream of thick milk.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The original Nan Teulaihth holding also appears to include Tinnepant Farm,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but records show that they were divided before the 1620s.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It is thought that the modern day Tinnepant Farm is the former Nan Teulaihth Farm,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
with the modern day Nan Teulaihth actually being Abernant Teulaihth.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Interestingly, both farms are given as Abernant Teulaihth in the 1728 survey.
