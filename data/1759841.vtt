WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
I'm just going to say at the top that my name is Marsha Armani and I'm here with Laura Phelps

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.160
and we're here to interview Tim Rooney and it is, we're at your home in Marshfields.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.160
That's right.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:21.120
And it is Tuesday July the 16th 2019.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.120
Okay so I'm just going to pop this down here then Tim.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.920
Tim Rooney that's a good Irish name.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.920
Yeah this is originally Irish.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.840
So I've got some relatives in Northern Ireland.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.840
Yeah.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.840
So I wonder if you could just start off, could you just introduce yourself?

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:46.440
Yeah well I was born in Northern Ireland and born in 1956 and obviously my dad had a farm

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.000
here then which was bigger than it is now.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:01:00.320
And when I got to school, I wasn't very keen on school, always had horses, always been

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.600
involved with horses, started riding point to pointing when I was 14.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.960
And I did like metal work in school so it seemed the obvious thing to do to start an

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.400
apprenticeship when I was 16 which I did out at Penhow and did my four year apprenticeship

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:26.280
then and got my certificate, my registered shoeing smith and I've been shoeing horses

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.280
ever since.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.760
I've had 15 apprentices, my son being one of them.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.680
My first apprentice was Billy Crothers from Rumney and Cardiff and he became world champion

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.440
farrier on five occasions.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:54.200
My second apprentice was Hayden Price who's been Olympic farrier a couple of occasions.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.680
My third apprentice was Andy Martin who's now got a practice near Chippen Norton in

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.680
the Cotswolds.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.320
He's an eminent farrier and judge and trains race horses as well.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.880
So yeah, quite a few apprentices over the years.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.120
I was going to say what's a stable?

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.120
What's a stable?

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.120
A talent?

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.840
That's a bit obvious isn't it?

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.600
They all started here, they all did their apprenticeships with me and spent four years

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.600
here.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.400
Who did you train under then?

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.960
I trained under a chap by the name of Christopher Bell who was a Scotsman who lived at Penhow

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:41.120
and he married, the old forge at Penhow was run by a gentleman by the name of Percy Townsend

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.440
and Percy Townsend had four daughters and Lou Bell married one of his daughters and

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.800
moved from Invergordon in Scotland down to live in South Wales and I did my apprenticeship

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.080
with Lou.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.040
So what sort of, what did you learn from him that you're clearly passing down?

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.440
What are you, what have you learned from him?

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:08.920
Work ethic I think as much as anything else and to do quality work which is the most important

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.800
thing because horses have to keep, they have to keep horses on the road, keep them sound.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.480
Why did you do your apprenticeship at Penhow?

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.480
Tell us what Penhow is.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.480
Penhow is only a small village between Newport and Chepstow on the A48 and there were very

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:38.440
few forges or farriers around when I started in 1972 and there were very few farriers around.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.200
I think between Chepstow and Cowbridge there were four guys shewing horses, now there's

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.040
something like 50 shewing horses.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.640
So it's changed a bit, we've trained too many now.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.200
What's changed though in the equine world, why are there more?

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:03.720
Well horses became a lot more popular for riding, for recreational riding, you know

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:12.480
as far as ponies in pony club, riding clubs, general riding and a lot of sort of livery

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:20.040
yards now have got all weather surfaces where people don't have to go riding out on the

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.840
roads because the roads are getting so busy now in this area, as in most areas, that it's

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.120
more dangerous to ride on the road than it used to be.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.000
Lord Trudiga, he was a huntsman wasn't he?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.280
He was the master of the hunt, he wasn't a huntsman.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.280
What's the difference?

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.240
Well the master is the boss and oversees everything, the huntsman is the man that works with the

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.280
hounds and actually hunts the hounds.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.960
So they would have used horses?

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.640
Yes definitely.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.080
So I'm just trying to think why there are so few farriers.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.720
Well there were a few farriers then.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.240
So you started in 1972 and there were only four then?

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.640
In this area, yes.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.240
So when Lord Trudiga was hunting that was much further back?

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.400
There was, yes definitely and you see when Lord Trudiga was hunting it would have been

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.920
pre-second world war.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:28.840
The Trudiga estate got split up and it was bought by the Eagle Star Insurance Company

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.080
and all the farms were then individually sold off by the Eagle Star Insurance Company, that's

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:43.200
who my dad bought this place off the Eagle Star in 1949 I think it was.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.560
Had been Trudiga estate for?

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.320
This was all Trudiga estate owned farms, the lot.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:55.000
Most of the houses in this area and I think the most easterly farm on the Trudiga estate

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:04.600
is the other side of Penhow in fact on the A48 and they owned, the estate was massive.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.240
You familiar with this area?

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.240
Yes.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.120
And Rupera, you've been up to Rupera Castle, well that was Lord Trudiga as well.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:24.000
The Llanrumney Hall, so all of Llanrumney and Rumney, Lower Macken, Rupera, Macken,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:32.800
Baselick, Ruderrin, because the original kennels for the estate were in Baselick because they

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:41.480
never had the kennels too close to the main house because of the smell of the hounds and

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:49.480
so as it was then you'd sort of come out of the Trudiga house and hack up to what is

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:55.080
Junction 28 now and then go up Forge Lane and the kennels were just at the top of Forge

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.320
Lane on the right hand side.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:04.160
And when you go to the top of Forge Lane and you've got the Trudiga arms in front of you,

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.280
there were workshops to the left of that as well.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.360
My goodness, there must have been so many people who were tenants of the Trudiga estate.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.640
Oh yeah, absolutely, yeah.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:20.240
So I wonder if we can just go back a little bit and talk about your parents, who were they?

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.920
My mum and dad came from St Andrews and Dines Powys.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:31.960
My mum was from Dines Powys, dad was St Andrews, two villages a mile apart.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:38.560
My dad was one of five, my mum was one of ten.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:47.760
They got married and had my older brother just as the Second World War began and then

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:54.040
dad was away in the army, he was in the Royal Artillery and spent about four years in Burma

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.040
during the Second World War.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.600
What, he was a prisoner?

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.320
No, he was a captain in the Royal Artillery, so he was in Burma.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.720
So he was...

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.720
Fighting the Japs.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.040
Goodness, what was his name?

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.120
Gustafus Emerson Rooney.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.120
Amazing.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.120
Why, what a name!

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.920
Did he use that name, that kind of in common?

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.880
He didn't like it, so he got it shortened and everyone called him Govo.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.880
OK.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.520
I wonder what his parents were thinking.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:33.320
Well, his mother was an Emerson, his father was Rooney, so they were all named...

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:38.720
My uncles were Dennis Emerson Rooney, Bernard Emerson Rooney, William Emerson Rooney and

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.200
Gustafus Emerson Rooney.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.200
Gosh!

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.200
He totally got the best name.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.680
Wow, Govo.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:51.280
So he spent four years in Burma with the Royal Artillery.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.960
Did he ever talk about his experiences?

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.240
Not a lot.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.440
Not a lot, no.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:08.640
He came back with a samurai sword that he'd actually taken off a dead Japanese officer.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:17.080
And when dad died, mum was short of money, so it got sold in Sotheby's because the inside

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:23.080
of the scabbard has the Japanese, the history of that particular family and their family

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.440
tree on it, inscribed on it.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:33.680
So it made then in 1974, that made about £750, which was quite a lot of money.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.440
We used to play with it as kids.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.440
What a story!

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:46.640
Did he say anything else about his experiences?

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.880
Just how nasty the Japanese were to fight.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.840
They were not nice people.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:02.080
Then obviously things have changed over the years, but no, he didn't say a great deal.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.400
And your mother then, tell us about her, what was her name?

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.400
Margaret Winifred.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.400
Well that's more like it.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.800
Margaret Winifred Hill was her maiden name.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:17.800
And as I say, she was one of ten, six girls, four boys, and they were born in St Andrews.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:25.800
My grandfather, her dad, was Walter Hill who started Hill's Transport in Cardiff, which

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.680
became quite a big firm.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.400
But then he died, he died before I was born.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:37.440
Well both my grandfathers did.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:44.480
But he died without making a will, so there were family feuds for many years after that.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.160
So do you know how your parents met?

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.640
In a village in Dinness Parish.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.760
I can't picture where Dinness Parish is.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.760
Right, Leckwith.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.480
Is it Cardiff?

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.480
Just to the west of Cardiff.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.480
Ah, OK.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.480
Wenvo?

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.920
Do you know Wenvo?

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:10.480
When you go from Wenvo going towards Roos Airport, when you get to where Wenvo Garden

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:16.480
Centre is, if you turn left at there, then the first place, the village you'll come to

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:22.340
is St Andrews, and the next one is Dinness Parish, and then Leckwith, and you come down

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.480
into Cardiff by Cardiff City Stadium.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.480
Oh, OK.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.480
OK.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.480
So what brought your parents here?

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.040
And were they from farming stock?

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:40.200
Dad was from farming stock, and then was obviously transport business.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:46.320
And obviously because these farms were being sold up then by the insurance company, that

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.240
was what brought him here.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.680
So Dinness Parish, what's the landscape there?

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.680
Is it flat?

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.680
No.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.680
Is it hilly?

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.680
No, hilly.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.160
OK, so this would have been completely different landscape.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.160
Oh, yeah.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:04.200
Do you remember him ever talking about maybe the challenges of that?

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:10.400
I think they had a lot of work to do when they first came here, as far as sort of taking

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.400
concerned.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.400
Cleaning out reams, that sort of thing.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:21.920
Because I've been trying to explain to Laura, because neither of us are from the area, so

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:27.440
explain to Laura, you know, the unique drainage system here.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.440
That's right.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:36.440
So, but if you're, it must be quite a challenge for a farmer coming from a hilly area to come

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.440
here.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:42.160
That's right, because you've got to, I mean, fortunately we're not too bad here.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:50.080
Once you get just slightly lower down, then it's, the boundaries of the fields are all

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.080
reams.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.560
Here, we've still got quite a few hedges.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.560
Why is that then?

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.140
Why have you got hedges and not reams?

00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:01.080
Because we're just above the structure of the reams.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.080
Oh, really?

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.720
OK, I've never thought about that.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:13.000
So when your parents came here, did it look different?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.880
Well all the farm buildings were that side then.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:17.880
Oh really?

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.880
Yeah.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:29.880
These were, Dad sold this for development in 1970.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:35.240
Yeah, around about 1970 I suppose.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.200
So what sort of farm was it?

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:45.600
Milking cows, sheep, pigs, chickens.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.320
Did you have a milk rang then?

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.440
No, no.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.560
But in the village here then we had a dairy.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.280
Oh yes, I know.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:58.800
Where, you've got, just the other side of the shop was Cambroy and United Dairies.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:05.360
And all the local farmers, there were a structure of very small farms all around here.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:13.960
And I think, we sat down and worked it out a few years ago, that between Rumney and Newport,

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:22.920
below the A48 there were something like 40 milk producing farms, but now there are three.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:29.440
They probably milk the same amount of cows, because they're all huge farming units.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:37.160
Whereas these were all small farms, pretty much self-sufficient, because we'd have 20

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:45.840
odd cows and some sheep, some pigs, some chickens, maybe fatten a couple of turkeys up for Christmas,

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.840
that sort of thing.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:51.400
I wonder if your father ever used the livestock market on, is it Tindy Brown?

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.400
Tindy Brown?

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:59.200
He could, I never knew it as Timo Lane, I always knew it as Market Road.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:05.560
Because the market was, and the market, I can't remember the market being in use, but

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:12.240
he could when he first came here, because they'd be able to drive the stock to market then.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.240
When you say drive, do you mean on the road?

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.240
Yeah.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:21.920
And I mean, there'd be milking cows walking up and down here all the time, going from

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:26.200
the field to the dairy back and forth.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.080
That was the norm in all villages.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.320
When you say to the dairy, you mean...

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.320
To be milked.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.320
...milking parlour.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.320
Yeah.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.320
So you had your own milking parlour, did you?

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:39.640
Yeah, there was a cowshed there and that's where they were all milked.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:48.120
So our milk was in a cooler here, and that's the only milk we ever had.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.640
Went into a churn?

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:57.880
Yeah, yeah, we'd have to take the churns down to the dairy every morning.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:02.440
So do you know, we've just turned off the main road to come up here, how much has that

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.320
road, for example, changed?

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:10.000
Oh, this village in Castleton has changed considerably.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:20.200
I mean, there was, between here and the Gateway Chapel just down the road, there were no houses.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:28.280
And then from the Gateway Chapel to the Mason's Arms pub, there were no bungalows.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.960
So it has changed considerably, the village.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.800
It was just a really rural...

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.600
Very rural, yeah.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:41.320
So it was all farmland?

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:44.320
Pretty much so, yeah.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:49.560
I was just taking Laura down towards Rumney, you know, where the meals are.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.560
Yeah.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:56.160
You know, I've spoken to people who said that was all farmland in recent...

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:01.960
Yeah, all small holdings, all small farms, small holders.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.280
Yeah.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:11.200
So your mother pitched in on the farm as well as she helped out?

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.840
Yeah, she was a good worker, Mum.

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:18.160
Had to be up at six every morning to get out there and help.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:25.440
Because Dad, he had what's called farmer's lung, which is from the spores in Faustey

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.840
Hay, and that affected his breathing quite considerably.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.640
So he couldn't...

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:38.360
From a young age, I could never remember him being able to do very much physical work.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.440
So Mum had to do quite a lot.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.920
Oh, really?

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.920
Mm-hmm.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:47.760
So I'm the youngest of five.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.560
So as soon as I was old enough, I was helping as well.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.360
You just all had to pitch in?

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.360
Yeah, absolutely.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:18:01.880
So before we move back onto you, Tim, are there any other memories or anecdotes your

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.680
parents told you about running a farm here?

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:12.080
It was hard work, but quite rewarding.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:17.680
Because the big garden where my son's house is there now, that was our lawn and garden.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.920
For the house here.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:25.560
And so we'd grow the veg.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.160
There'd be always food here.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.840
There was an orchard just down there.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.000
There was another orchard just up here.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.720
So we always had plenty of apples, pears, that sort of thing.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.720
Cider?

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.720
Cider?

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.120
No, no, we didn't make any cider.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.120
Could have done.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.120
The old man was more of a whiskey drinker than a cider drinker.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.040
So you didn't have a mobile cider press around you?

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.400
No.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.400
No.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.400
OK.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.400
Did the...

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.440
What about haymaking time and stuff?

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.440
Yeah.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.360
Was that something... did your parents have to do the old-fashioned rick and...

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.120
They did before they moved here.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:07.200
By the time they'd moved here, which is, as I say, after the Second World War, small bales

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.840
of hay were being produced then.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:15.360
Did your father then, when your parents came here, did they have workhorses?

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.160
No.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.640
He had an old tractor.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.640
Oh.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.960
That was quite early for a tractor then.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.640
Well, they started before the Second World War, the tractors.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:32.920
They started in the sort of 20s and 30s, but they didn't come into a lot of use until the

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.920
early 50s.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.920
Yeah.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.920
So he was quite early then, really, wasn't he?

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.920
Yeah.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:38.920
Yeah.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.920
So what's your earliest memory here?

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.360
This has been your home forever?

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.360
Yeah, it has.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.360
Yeah.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:51.320
When my wife and I got married, we moved to a little house in Baislech and then moved

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:59.360
back to Mallards Reach and then ended up buying this back off my mum, because she was getting

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:06.120
elderly, living on her own, because Dad died when I was 18, so...

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:11.480
So she found it tough, and so I bought it back off her.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.920
So it was still a small holding then?

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.920
Yes.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:22.840
Yeah, Mum would rent the ground out just to get a bit of small income.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:29.480
But I've always had the forge there, so obviously I would pay Mum rent for the forge until we

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.480
bought it.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.520
So did you go to Marshfield School?

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.520
Yeah.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.520
So what was that like?

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.520
So you were there...

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.080
Well, it was an old church school, Marshfield School.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:46.840
Where Marshfield School is now, the building just the other side of the traffic calming,

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.040
was the church school, that was the school.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.040
Oh really?

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.040
Yeah.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.040
Ah.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:56.040
Erm, let me see...

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.680
So you would have been there in the 60s?

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.680
That would have been...

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:09.880
I started in Marshfield School in 1961, and I moved then up to Beysleyck when I was 11,

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:10.880
so 1967.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:17.760
So what was school like then?

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.320
Marshfield School was quite a nice little school.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:30.800
Erm, you start off in what was the Infants, and then moved up three classes before moving

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.320
on to Beysleyck.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.880
So what did you do as a child down here?

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.480
Played quite a lot.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.840
What sort of things did you do?

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.760
Climbing trees, making dens.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.200
Did you ever play in the rings?

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.240
Erm, no, not really.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:58.680
No, between here and the county club in St Melons, which is only three quarters of a

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:04.760
mile as the crow flies directly across there, erm, and Dad rented a lot of ground there

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:15.160
off the guy who bought the golf course back in the 1940s.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:19.280
That would have been off the... presumably that was off the Trinidad estate as well.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:25.280
Erm, a chap by the name of Gwyn Davies, and he and Dad were quite friendly, so Dad used

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:30.200
to rent the ground off him, and we had the grazing on the golf course during the winter

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.200
as well.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.200
Oh really?

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:38.680
Because golf wasn't the sport or pastime that it is now, and during the winter no one would

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.680
play golf.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.680
Do you like graze grazing?

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.000
So we grazed sheep up there.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.360
Oh my goodness, can you imagine?

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.000
And then we'd use what were the roughs then.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.280
I mean the roughs are about this high now.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.280
Do you play golf at all?

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.280
No.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:59.480
Erm, but all golf courses now, the grass, there's no long grass anywhere, whereas when

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:07.800
we had the ground up there, erm, we'd make hay off the roughs in the summer time, and

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.960
graze sheep in the winter time.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:10.960
Oh that's hilarious.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:16.200
Of course, when we were making hay then, cutting the grass, you'd be finding lots of golf balls,

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.800
so we'd go and sell them as kids, we'd go and sell them back to the golfers.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.080
What did the golfers ever have anything to say about that?

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.600
Were they ever up there at all?

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.760
Yeah, but they didn't know anything different, that wasn't the norm then.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.680
What about the seawall?

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.680
Did you ever go down there?

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.240
Yeah, we used to go down there as kids playing.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.640
Which part of the seawall did you go down?

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.640
By the lighthouse.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:40.320
Okay, and what sort of things did you get up to down there?

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.840
Catching, erm, crabs.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:43.840
Hmm.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.960
What, going down on the foreshore then?

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:46.960
Yeah.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:52.680
So was that ever, were your parents ever concerned about you being down there?

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.440
They generally took us down there.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.440
Oh!

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.480
Ha ha ha ha ha!

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.280
I mean, because you have to know the tides though, don't you?

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.280
Because it has to be...

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:09.680
Oh yeah, the tides can be very dangerous, so we'd never go too far from the seawall.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.680
Hmm.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.280
Did you ever go out and find anything?

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:17.600
Find anything, as in?

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.240
Clay pipes, cannon balls?

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.240
No.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.240
No?

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.240
No.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.440
Did you ever swim in the water there?

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.440
No.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.440
Did you?

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.440
It's muddy.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.440
Ha ha ha!

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.440
Well, people have done, haven't they?

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:35.040
My dad would take us down to cold nap baths to swim.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.040
Oh really?

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.040
Ha ha ha ha!

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.200
Well, I learnt to swim in the swimming pool in the county club.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.200
Oh really?

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:47.400
It was a private house then, and it had an indoor pool, which were very rare things in

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.400
those days.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.400
Yeah, quite posh.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.400
Hmm, very posh.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.400
You've got your own now though, haven't you?

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.400
A hot tub, yeah.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:57.880
So we had just been down at the lighthouse in the big chalet park there.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.840
What was there before that was established?

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:05.320
Well, I can't remember it anything other than a caravan park, because there were kids that

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.680
came to Marshfield School from the caravan site there.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.680
Oh.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.960
But it wasn't a gypsy travelling?

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:13.960
No, never.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:14.960
No.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:20.600
So, do you know there's lots of gypsy travelling camps around?

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.000
Have they always been down here?

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
No.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000
No?

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
No.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:35.520
They were situated between Peterstone, as in by the six bells, and Rumney.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.240
The verges there are very, very wide.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.560
Now this horse is tethered out there.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:45.160
But there would be a couple of Romany gypsies with their caravans parked on some of those

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:50.920
wide verges, and that's where they lived.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:56.000
But the gypsy camps now, they're Irish tinkers, they're not real old gypsies.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.720
These were the proper old Romany gypsies.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.760
Yeah, what, with roll-top caravans?

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:08.800
Yeah, roll-top caravans, slightly darker skins, and the ladies would come round selling pegs

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.280
or telling fortunes.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.280
Oh, yeah.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:14.200
So, would never turn them away.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.200
Oh, really?

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.200
Yeah.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:22.360
So, let's just go back to when you started to become, when did you first think about

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:23.360
becoming a farrier?

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:28.400
When I was in school and Dad, I wanted to leave school and he said, well, you've got

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.640
to go to work.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.400
And that was really the only thing that appealed to me.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:38.120
So, I started my apprenticeship with the idea of doing my apprenticeship and then doing

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.280
something else afterwards.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:45.720
But as I say, Dad died halfway through my apprenticeship.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.520
So there was always stuff to do here.

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:54.280
And then I met my wife when I was 18 or 19.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:57.640
We got married when I was 21.

00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.680
And the rest, as they say, is history.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:05.320
But so, why did you choose Penhow to do your apprenticeship?

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.680
We used to take horses out there to be shod.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:08.720
Roaring horses?

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:09.720
Yeah.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.600
OK, so how long have you kept horses?

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.400
Oh, my gosh.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:21.840
My grandfather, Dad's father, was a horse dealer and used to sell horses to the army.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.120
And he used to race horses.

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.120
My father raced.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.320
All of my uncles raced.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.320
Oh, my goodness.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.320
So, let's just go to your father's father.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.920
What was his name?

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.760
He was Gustavus as well.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.720
My goodness.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.200
So, he was a horse dealer?

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.200
Yeah.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.880
And farmer.

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.160
OK, well, tell me about him then.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.160
Well, he was dead before I was born.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:53.040
So it's only hearsay from what I heard from my father.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.840
I mean, he had four sons and a daughter.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.480
So I think he was quite strict.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:02.760
And he was still riding into his 70s.

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.440
When you say riding, what, leisure riding or racing?

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:11.040
No, no, no, riding horses to get them schooled or sell.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.400
And he used to sell horses to the army because the army wanted as many horses as they could

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.800
get, especially leading up to the Second World War.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.800
That's amazing.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:31.480
And then his sons, because my dad was the youngest of the four sons, and the other sons

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.080
all went into horses in one way or another.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.440
And what sort of way?

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:47.760
Uncle Dennis went to work for a chap in the West Country who had hunters and he produced

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.600
the hunters for him.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:57.000
Uncle Barney was head lad in a racing yard out of Chepstow for Colin Davis.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.360
And that was a very successful yard.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:11.280
And then Uncle Bill, he went to Northern Ireland and he became the biggest winner of point

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:18.160
to point races for many, many years until the record was broken about 12 years ago.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.840
And he also had stallions that stood there.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:24.480
He had a son and four daughters.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.480
His son got killed racing.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.040
Broke his neck, got killed.

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:36.240
My cousin Jerry, Uncle Bill got killed actually and they said the last rites over him because

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.840
they thought he was Catholic.

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.640
But he survived, just a full son.

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:46.040
My Uncle Barney, he broke his neck at Worcester races but he survived.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.280
My brother broke his neck and he survived.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.280
Wow, they're jockeys.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:51.280
Yeah.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:56.680
But when you say jockey, do you mean you said point to point?

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.000
Yeah, point to point amateur racing.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.600
OK, so they're jockeys.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.880
Amateur jockeys.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:04.880
OK.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.840
OK, so what's the difference then?

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.520
Amateurs don't get paid.

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:16.240
But, I mean, are you tougher?

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:20.280
Well, normally you've got a day job as well.

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.320
Yeah, but is the course...

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:27.240
The courses were a lot tougher than they are now.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:33.960
And when I started point to point, and I said I was 14, and in point to points and it under

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:37.640
rules then, there were no, what I call, safety factors.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:43.480
Now, the number of horses that run in each race, there's a limit as to how many can run.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:47.040
There were no safety factors in those days.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.440
Every race was a cavalry charge.

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.040
Would you have worn a helmet?

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:55.200
Yes, but not as good as they were now.

00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:06.240
You know, health and safety has improved that considerably in so much as the helmets and

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.240
the body protectors.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.160
We had no body protectors.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:13.120
Just a flimsier sort of helmet.

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.720
And so your dad was a horseman too?

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.720
Yeah, yeah.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:17.600
Dad rode about 70 winners point to point in.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.600
Really?

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:19.600
Yeah.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.280
Where did he race then?

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.600
With any races down here?

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.640
Oh yeah, local point to points.

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.640
Where?

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:37.120
Beyslech, Macken, Penhow, Howick near Chapstow, Bonvillsten, Penturk.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:40.880
Yeah, there were a lot of local point to points.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:45.880
So was he still racing later in life?

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:54.680
He would have finished racing in the sort of late 60s and then I started in 1970.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:59.960
So he would have probably finished in 1964, 65 maybe.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.400
So you kept horses here?

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.400
Always, yeah.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.400
How many did you have?

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:07.520
I suppose the most we've ever had.

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:10.280
He would probably have been about a dozen.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.240
So that's how you knew the farrier in Penhow?

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.240
Yeah.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.240
Dad brought yours up there.

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:18.160
But that's quite away from here, isn't it?

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.160
Yeah, it is.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.480
Why did he not choose somewhere closer?

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:26.840
There wasn't, well there was one in Macken but he wasn't, there was one very old gentleman

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:30.240
in Macken who didn't want to take on any more work.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:37.720
But his son hadn't done any proper training so dad didn't want to take the horses to him.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.680
He wanted to take them to a guy that was well trained.

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.920
So this was a Scottish guy?

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.920
Yeah.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.640
So he'd been there for a long time?

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.720
No, he was quite a young guy.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:53.360
Lou was only sort of 30, 31 when I started my apprenticeship.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:59.160
And then by the time I was getting to the end of my apprenticeship in 1976, Lou had

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:04.660
to give up because he got bad sciatica, back trouble.

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:10.120
So I was able to take on some of his work and then the business progressed from there.

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.600
So when you finished your apprenticeship did you set up here?

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:13.600
Yeah.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.600
Yeah.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.280
So what were the early days like then here?

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:25.080
I mean was there much, did you and do you get much custom from the area?

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:33.640
Oh yeah, because there weren't very many farriers about then so I was pretty much inundated

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.640
with work.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:38.880
That's why I took on apprentices to help me.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.760
And the business progressed from there.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.440
Can you probably just go back to Penhow slightly?

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.440
Yeah.

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.440
So is that Penhow Beagles?

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:51.200
Yeah, well that was very close to where the forge was in Penhow.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.800
You know where the Forester's Oaks pub is?

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:54.800
Yeah.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:34:00.200
When you pass the Forester's Oaks you climb a hill and halfway up that hill there's an

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:07.480
entrance in on the right hand side to Hunter's Lodge and Derek Jones had the Beagles there.

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:13.760
That's where he kept the Monmouth Beagles and then the forge at Penhow was just past

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.160
the Crosswind pub.

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:18.920
As you pass the Crosswind pub there's a little house on the right hand side.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:23.240
That was the house for the forge and the buildings were just a little further down.

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:25.400
So you would have had lots of hunts?

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.640
A lot of horses came to the forge then.

00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:28.640
Yeah.

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:29.640
We didn't go out shooing.

00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:31.240
No, they came to you.

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.240
Yeah.

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:34.440
Well how much is your job going out then?

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.440
No.

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.160
I mean...

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:44.960
We go out to shoo virtually every horse we shoo now because people, number one, they

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:50.360
would prefer you to go to them because it's more convenient.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:54.800
It suits us a lot better because the horses are quieter in their own environment than

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:59.000
putting them in a trailer or a lorry and taking them to a forge because they're out of their

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.840
comfort zone a little bit then.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:06.240
Whereas when I was at Penhow most of the horses that came to the forge to be shot were ridden

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.240
there.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.240
Ridden there?

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:14.840
Well yeah, it was a different... the traffic wasn't like it is now.

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:24.440
So do you know, I've seen people trotting along here with those little carriage... not

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.440
carriage, not sure...

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.440
Sulky.

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.440
It's a silky.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.440
A silky?

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.440
Yeah.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.440
S-I-L?

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.640
S-U-L-K-I-E.

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:33.640
Sulky.

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:34.640
Sulky, okay.

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.880
Yeah, that's what they're called and that's what they train them behind that and then

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.080
race them on tracks.

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:41.240
Oh right, okay.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:44.640
So is that necessarily a gypsy traveller type thing?

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:53.480
Yeah, it is a little bit but they do a certain... they do some road races as well which aren't

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.480
legal I don't think.

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.840
Well I think I've seen them on the A48.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.040
They go on the A48, they go on the risk of bypass.

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:03.040
Yeah, it's quite scary.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.040
Yeah.

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:08.400
So do you get custom from these... you know the horses at Tether?

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.240
I have shot some of them for them in the past.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:13.040
I don't shoot any for them now.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.040
Okay.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.840
Some my son does a few.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:20.440
But would that have been quite a bit of custom at some point?

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.240
Yeah, because they wear the shoes out very quickly.

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:25.040
Yeah, yeah.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:29.840
So where do most of your customers come from then?

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:34.040
Well word of mouth, I mean I've been shooing for most of my customers for 30 odd years

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.040
I suppose.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:38.040
Some a bit longer.

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:45.640
So we must be doing something right to keep the custom and generally word of mouth.

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:49.240
But most of the horses we shoo are sort of riding horses now.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:54.880
We did at one time shoo a couple of racing yards and there were a lot more point to pointers

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:59.880
trained locally back in the sort of 70s, 80s and 90s.

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:02.080
There aren't now.

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:06.080
So we used to have a lot of work from the point to pointers and race horses.

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:08.280
Why aren't there now?

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:11.880
A lot of farmers don't have point to pointers now.

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:15.780
Whereas it used to be that every farmer would have a point to pointer.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:17.880
And there are fewer farmers here as well?

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.180
Yeah, yeah definitely.

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:28.180
So when I think of horses and horse racing I always think of posh people.

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:30.180
No.

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:33.180
So but...

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:36.180
Anyone can have a horse to go point to pointer.

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:41.180
Was it something that most farm sons did then?

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:45.780
Yeah, a great deal of farmers had a point to pointer and their sons or daughters would

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:47.180
get involved with them.

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:51.180
So sons and daughters could race alongside each other?

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:57.180
Yeah, but now the restrictions for riding in point to pointers become more difficult.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:02.180
You've got to pay to get a riding certificate.

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:06.180
You can't start until you're 16.

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:09.180
Whereas there was no age restriction years ago.

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:15.180
And it's become...

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:20.180
It has become more professional unfortunately.

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:29.180
So that it's sort of pushing the real amateur's fun lovers away from the sport a little.

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:31.180
Which is a shame.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:35.180
What's the biggest horse you've ever shooed?

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:36.180
Shooed.

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.180
Or shod.

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:38.180
What's the expression?

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:39.180
Biggest.

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:40.180
18 hands.

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:41.180
Is that big?

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:42.180
Yeah.

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.180
Smallest?

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:47.180
26 inches.

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:50.180
Have you ever been kicked or bitten or anything like that?

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:53.180
Yeah, loads of times.

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:59.180
Kick, bitten, broken bones, stitches.

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:02.180
All the fingers have been stitched together at one point or another.

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:08.180
So you were in your workshop before and it almost looks timeless.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.180
Really.

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.180
And I don't mean that to be an insult.

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:13.180
I think it looks gorgeous.

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:19.180
Is there anything about the craft of being a farrier?

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:21.180
I mean, would you describe yourself as a farrier?

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.180
Yeah, definitely.

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:28.180
The tools that you can buy are a lot better now.

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:31.180
Precision tools are a lot better.

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:37.180
And obviously electric helped a great deal.

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:39.180
Yeah.

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:44.180
Because you have originally the old wind up forges.

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:48.180
That was the first sort of forge to take out.

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:53.180
And then gas forges became usable.

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:58.180
So then it was far easier to go out shooing horses.

00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.180
Maybe more mobile.

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:02.180
Definitely.

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:13.180
But is there anything about your craft that is uniquely Welsh or of the levels?

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:15.180
I mean, could you say that?

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.180
No.

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.180
No?

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.180
No.

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:22.180
In a word.

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:24.180
Tipsy.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:26.180
Hello, hello darling.

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:31.180
So do you know, I'll come back to the thought for a minute with me,

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:35.180
but do your fields have names?

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.180
Yes.

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:41.180
The one across there that's got the bales in it is the Chapel Field,

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:43.180
because that's the closest one to the chapel.

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.180
This is the front field.

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:49.180
Field down there has always been known as the Field Beyond Goods,

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:52.180
because the cottage there was Bill Good and his wife,

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.180
and then Ron Good, their son.

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:58.180
And they were there for as long as ever I can remember.

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:00.180
So, yeah.

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:02.180
Do you know there on any map?

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:04.180
Or is that just something you know?

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:10.180
Oh, that's just our way of calling them.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:14.180
So would you know the names of reams around here?

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:20.180
No, only the sort of main ream there, going down to the gout farm.

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:23.180
So the gout, forgive me for saying the ignorance,

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:26.180
the gout is, is that another name for ream?

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:30.180
No, there was a farm at the bottom of the Broadway.

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:32.180
That long...

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:34.180
The long wide ream, the very wide ream,

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:38.180
when you go past the Imiron now and over the railway bridge,

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:42.180
then you've got the Broadway there, is a big main ream,

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:45.180
and when you get to the bottom of that,

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:50.180
the building on the right hand side now was the gout farm.

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.180
Is it still there?

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:55.180
The building is, the farm isn't, no, no.

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:58.180
The farm got sold, just across the way,

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.180
there was turned into a golf course,

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:02.180
but that's not, it's not a golf course anymore.

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:04.180
Quite a few golf courses around here, aren't there?

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.180
Yeah, yeah.

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:08.180
Did you ever have fish in the reams?

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:10.180
Yeah, we used to catch fish.

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:12.180
What sort of fish?

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:16.180
Oh, only little tiddlers, nothing very much, nothing substantial.

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:18.180
No eels or anything?

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:21.180
You'd see an odd eel, yeah, but not too many.

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:24.180
So, do you know when you were a child, a young boy, and now,

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:28.180
has anything changed in nature, has anything disappeared,

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:30.180
or anything returned, or anything like that?

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:32.180
Disappeared.

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:41.180
Any birds you used to see, or flowers you used to...

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:43.180
We hear the cuckoo now.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:47.180
We hear the cuckoo every year.

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:52.180
Haven't heard a cuckoo down here for 20 years, I don't suppose.

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:55.180
So the cuckoo's gone.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:01.180
Night jar, we don't hear a night jar now.

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:08.180
Get plenty of swallows, but they were late this year.

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:13.180
Probably not as many starlings as they used to be.

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:19.180
But apart from that, that would probably be all, as far as the birds are concerned.

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.180
Hairs?

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.180
Don't see any hairs now, used to see lots of hairs.

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:26.180
Otters?

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:31.180
Haven't seen an otter for a long time now, because they were mink that got loose,

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:36.180
and they basically chased the otters away, because they were more aggressive.

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:42.180
So did you have any unusual clients over the years?

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:44.180
You don't have to name them.

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:46.180
Any unusual clients?

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:48.180
Yeah, or ones that stand out in your memory?

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:52.180
Quite a few.

00:43:55.180 --> 00:44:02.180
There used to be a very grand old gentleman by the name of Len Hayes,

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:07.180
who lived just off Wentlug Road in Rumney,

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:10.180
and he used to drive horses all the time.

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:14.180
Len was quite a character, always wore a grey bowler hat,

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:20.180
had one foot which was a bit gammy, so he never walked sound.

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:24.180
But he used to drive horses quite a lot.

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:26.180
Through choice, because he didn't have a car?

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:28.180
Oh, through choice.

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:33.180
He'd drive the horses from Rumney to the Forge to get shod, and then drive them home again.

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:36.180
So was it just a little two-seater?

00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:41.180
Oh, no, he'd drive a carriage, so he'd be able to take four or five people in it.

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:42.180
Oh, why?

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:45.180
Oh, yeah, proper. He'd two big grey horses.

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:47.180
Oh, how lovely.

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:50.180
He was a great old character, Len Hayes.

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:52.180
What was his background then?

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:58.180
He'd always been a coach in person, because he...

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:06.180
I don't know when it was, but he drove a stagecoach from St Melan's to London,

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:08.180
but I don't know how long ago.

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:11.180
Why? Just because he could?

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:16.180
Yeah. They had stop-off points on the way, because there were no motorways then.

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:18.180
Gosh, that's amazing.

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:19.180
Yeah.

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:20.180
Well, did he tell you that?

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:21.180
Yeah, he told me that.

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:25.180
Yeah? So he had a collection of carriages?

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:26.180
He did, yeah.

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:31.180
Yeah, he used to have a little hackney pony that he'd take in a small carriage,

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:34.180
a bit bigger than the silkies you see out here.

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:37.180
But then, as far as the bigger horses are concerned,

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:39.180
he had a couple of different carriages for them,

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:42.180
because he did weddings and that sort of thing.

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:46.180
Gosh. And he lived near Rumley, that way?

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:48.180
Yeah, he was off Wendtlug Road.

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:51.180
Yeah. Any other characters?

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:58.180
Erm, well, the original old Tom Price the Gypsy,

00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:05.180
he came here one morning about half past six, I suppose, in a Morris 1000 van.

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:11.180
That would have been 1976, I suppose,

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:15.180
with a Shetland pony in the back, to be sure.

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:19.180
In the back of the van?

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:22.180
In the back of the van, back of a Morris 1000 van.

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:24.180
Yeah.

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:28.180
So was he quite a well-known character in the community?

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:29.180
Yeah, he was.

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:30.180
Why?

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:33.180
I think he was a bit of a fighter.

00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:34.180
Oh!

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:39.180
He had about four sons and they're all erm...

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.180
They've all had horses over the years.

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:48.180
Not nice.

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:54.180
He was a genuine chap.

00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:57.180
Did he live in a roll-top or something?

00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:59.180
No, he lived in a caravan.

00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:01.180
Hmm.

00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:07.180
Do you have erm... So your son, no, he was your apprentice?

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:09.180
Yep, he was.

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:12.180
And he's working with you? Yeah, what's his name?

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:13.180
Sam.

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:15.180
So, second generation. Yep.

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:22.180
So you're passing on skills that you learnt from your teacher?

00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:23.180
That's right.

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:24.180
Yeah.

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:27.180
And what I've learnt from my apprentices over the years as well.

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:28.180
Okay.

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:30.180
As you always learn stuff.

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:35.180
If they go off to competitions or shows and they come back with other ideas,

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:38.180
so you have to be open-minded.

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:39.180
Something that you'd like to ask.

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:43.180
I'm quite intrigued by these, like the sort of world championships

00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:45.180
and the Olympic events.

00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:50.180
Oh, right, yeah, well Billy Crothers, as I say, was from Maxwell Road in Romney

00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:55.180
and he was always very keen on doing competitions

00:47:55.180 --> 00:48:00.180
and he went off to America

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:04.180
and they had a competition,

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:07.180
they went to America

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:11.180
and they had world championships at the Calgary Stampede,

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:17.180
which is in July, beyond now I suppose, maybe it was last week,

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:21.180
and he won the world championships over there five times.

00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:22.180
That's amazing.

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:27.180
Another Welshman who did his apprenticeship in Cowbridge was Grant Moon

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:31.180
and he did his apprenticeship at the same time as Billy

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:34.180
and he won the world championship five times as well.

00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:36.180
So how does it work?

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:39.180
How do they compete? How are they assessed?

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:45.180
Well, we went across, my wife and I went across to the Stampede about,

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:48.180
must be about 11 years ago I suppose,

00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:55.180
and Billy and Andy were competing across there at the same time.

00:48:55.180 --> 00:49:04.180
And what they do is they have to shoe a foot on a horse

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:08.180
by starting off with a piece of straight bar,

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:11.180
measure the horse's foot, cut the bar to the right size

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:14.180
and then trim the horse's foot in readiness for it,

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:19.180
make the shoe, fit it and apply it within a certain time.

00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:23.180
And they have to do that over a period of a couple of days on different horses,

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:28.180
different types of horses, and always within a time limit.

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:32.180
That's remarkable, things that you never even think about existing.

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:35.180
I know, I know.

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:40.180
It was like $10,000 to the winner.

00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:46.180
So what makes one, I don't know how to phrase the question,

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:50.180
how would one person's work be judged as superior to another?

00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:53.180
What are the criteria?

00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:57.180
The quality of the work, the precision of the work,

00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:03.180
the levelness of the foot, the symmetry of the foot when it's been trimmed

00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:07.180
has to be very, very good, the levelness has to be good.

00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:12.180
Then when the shoe is made, it has to fit that foot exactly,

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:17.180
and within a certain time.

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:22.180
Tipsy.

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:29.180
She's bigger than you, Tips.

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:31.180
How old is she?

00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:36.180
Oh, she's only about 13 weeks now.

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:42.180
We went up to Mould in North Wales to get her when she was just coming up to 8 weeks old.

00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:45.180
She's been very brave.

00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:51.180
Whether she'd be that brave if there wasn't a fence there, I don't know.

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:54.180
Sorry, I know I asked you this before, but I wasn't recording it.

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:59.180
What are the oldest tools in your workshop, and have any been passed on to you?

00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:08.180
Well, there are some tongs in there, which I had off a couple of guys when I started out.

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:12.180
There would be a couple of shoeing tools that I had off an old gentleman

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:16.180
the other side of the village, Tom Meakin.

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:17.180
Who was he?

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:25.180
He lived on the Market Road, or Timoallayne, and he had a pigery there.

00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:35.180
And when I started, he had done a little bit of shoeing at some point or another for himself many years before.

00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:37.180
So he handed me a couple of tools.

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:40.180
Because he kept work horses, presumably?

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:41.180
Yeah.

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:46.180
And then, as I say, some tongs for making shoes to hold them.

00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:51.180
I had those just after I started.

00:51:51.180 --> 00:52:00.180
Then there was another guy who had been working up in the valleys, and he retired and had given up.

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:05.180
He was living across here in Dufferin, and he rang me up and said,

00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:08.180
I've got some tools here if you want to come and buy them.

00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:10.180
So I bought those tools off him.

00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:16.180
And the anvils, a couple of anvils there that are quite old, which I bought.

00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:20.180
I bought the one, I was given the other one.

00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:23.180
So they'd be pretty old, I suppose.

00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:31.180
So you've talked a lot about being a farrier, but did you ever have much trade from farmers

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:34.180
wanting to use your forging skills?

00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:38.180
Well, when I was doing my apprenticeship in Penhow,

00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:42.180
what we used to have was that the council workers would come in then

00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:47.180
and bring in, say, 20 picks to be sharpened.

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:51.180
You don't see council workers using picks now.

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:53.180
Because it's all machined.

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:57.180
But they had picks that would get worn out or broken,

00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:00.180
so they'd bring them into the forge to be sharpened.

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:07.180
We did some work for Welsh Water Authority, making brackets and that sort of thing.

00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:11.180
And we've done the same here.

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:18.180
When I first came here, I first started after finishing my apprenticeship,

00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:27.180
putting handles in shovels and spades, forks, that sort of thing, or repairing them,

00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:30.180
and sharpening tools.

00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:33.180
Repairing shovels and forks?

00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:35.180
Putting new handles in them.

00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:39.180
And if they were bent or anything, then we'd straighten them up and put them...

00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:41.180
How much of that do you get now?

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:44.180
Not very much. People go and buy new instead.

00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:46.180
It's that we're in a throwaway society.

00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:51.180
They don't repair things, they just chuck it away and buy something new.

00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:55.180
They can bring it to a farrier or a forge and they can source it for you.

00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:57.180
Yeah.

00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:03.180
Do you ever think that at high tide you're below sea level here?

00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:07.180
No. I think we're 22 foot above sea level here.

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:10.180
You're 22 foot above? Okay.

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:13.180
So this is where the land is beginning to rise again a bit here?

00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:14.180
Yeah.

00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:16.180
Have you ever been on the sea wall when it's at high tide?

00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:17.180
Yeah.

00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:18.180
What's that like?

00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:21.180
Oh, it's pretty impressive.

00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:26.180
Especially when you get the spring and autumn tides, which are quite high.

00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:28.180
Yeah.

00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:33.180
And of course, they said about the great flood in the 15th century,

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:37.180
because there's a mark on Marshfield Church,

00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:43.180
and there's a mark on Gethly Bear, where the tidal waters came up to.

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:46.180
But it was probably a tsunami, wasn't it?

00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:50.180
We can't make the mine out, can we?

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:55.180
But yeah, the whole of the moors were flooded.

00:54:55.180 --> 00:55:02.180
And at very low tide, you can see the remains of the old Peterston village out in the mudflats.

00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:06.180
No, I've been told that. Is that true?

00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:07.180
Yeah.

00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:09.180
Really? Have you seen it?

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:14.180
But yeah, you see remains of buildings.

00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:20.180
So what happened? Why is that out there? Is that because the sea's retreated or come back?

00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:25.180
Well, that's where the village of Peterston was.

00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:30.180
Where you stand on the sea wall, that's where the sea wall was built.

00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:33.180
Wow. My goodness.

00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:38.180
I couldn't tell you exactly when the sea wall was built,

00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:43.180
but it was the sea wall defence to stop any more flooding.

00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:45.180
My goodness, that's amazing.

00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:50.180
So the villagers had to retreat back to what is higher ground.

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:52.180
I wonder when that was.

00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:56.180
Is it before your lifetime? Before you were born?

00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:59.180
Oh yeah, yeah. I can't remember when it was.

00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:06.180
Did you, um, did you have anything else you wanted to ask?

00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:12.180
Is there anything else you'd like to add, Tim, that we haven't asked?

00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:15.180
Oh, nice. You've been fairly thorough.

00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:17.180
Oh, that makes a change.

00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:21.180
Does it feel good that your son's carrying on?

00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:23.180
Oh yeah, definitely.

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:33.180
So, sorry, have I asked this question about when you started off or when your father moved down here?

00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:37.180
Would there have been any village ford? You haven't talked about it?

00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:41.180
There wasn't a ford in Marshfield. There was a ford in Castleton.

00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:42.180
Yeah.

00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:50.180
And I believe the lady whose husband had the ford is still there.

00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:56.180
She's very elderly, but when you get to the top of Castleton

00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:59.180
and you've got the old church on the right-hand side,

00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:02.180
just next to it there was an old tiny ford there.

00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:07.180
Oh really? So was that within your father's lifetime?

00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:08.180
Yes.

00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:09.180
Yeah.

00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:13.180
But Dad originally used to ride horses to St. Melons to get them shot.

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:15.180
Did he?

00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:18.180
Yeah, before transporting horses.

00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:22.180
I can only remember going to Penhow to get the horses shot.

00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:27.180
Jack Jones had a forge in St. Melons.

00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:33.180
They're building some buildings there now.

00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:35.180
There's a chip shop and it was just past that.

00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:38.180
And the forge house is still there.

00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:41.180
And he used to spend three days of the week there.

00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:44.180
And he had another forge up in Rumney.

00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:49.180
There was a pub which has been knocked down now called the Carpenter's Arms.

00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:52.180
And his other forge was on the end of the Carpenter's Arms.

00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:57.180
What, to maximise his business you mean?

00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:58.180
Yeah, yeah.

00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:05.180
Because obviously all the customers then would ride horses or lead horses to the forge.

00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:10.180
So it was easier to lead them if they were closer to St. Melons or closer to Rumney.

00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:12.180
So how would your father have got to St. Melons from here?

00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:14.180
Oh from here to two miles.

00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:15.180
Oh really?

00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:17.180
Yeah, down the road here.

00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:21.180
And you come out by, well you go to Cypress Drive but you didn't have to then.

00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:23.180
It was just through the lanes.

00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:28.180
But do you know, just the footpaths around here.

00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:29.180
Yeah.

00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:30.180
Do you know about all the footpaths?

00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:31.180
Oh don't I?

00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:34.180
They're a bane of our life.

00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:36.180
The footpath comes right through the middle of this yard.

00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:38.180
There's a stoyle there.

00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:41.180
And it goes right through the front field.

00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:43.180
There's a stoyle at the bottom of the front field.

00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:44.180
Yeah.

00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:48.180
Well it's just a shortcut for kids now back and forth to the playing fields.

00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:53.180
But originally footpaths were built to either go to church or go to a well.

00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:57.180
So, sorry, are they still a public right of way?

00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:58.180
Yeah.

00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:00.180
Even though they're going through your land.

00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:02.180
So you don't have to just let anyone who wants to run through here.

00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:04.180
Yeah, but we do police them.

00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:05.180
Right.

00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:10.180
You know, because we've got kids coming through, messing about and playing and jumping on fences and kicking a ball around.

00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:12.180
There's all the animals as well.

00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:16.180
Smoking and drinking and so yeah, we keep a very close eye on them.

00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:18.180
So was there a well up away somewhere?

00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:19.180
There was a well.

00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:23.180
Where those big trees are there, there was a well in there.

00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:25.180
I can remember as a kid.

00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:26.180
Really?

00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:27.180
Hmm.

00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:29.180
What do you remember about it?

00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:30.180
Was it a functioning well?

00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:32.180
There was water running there.

00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:33.180
Really?

00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:41.180
Yeah, there was a big old slab of covering it basically.

00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:44.180
So did your parents use that when they arrived here?

00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:45.180
Nope.

00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:49.180
No, no, they had water coming in on a tap.

00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:50.180
That's interesting, isn't it?

00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:51.180
Modern.

00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:54.180
Oh yeah, that is modern for its time, isn't it?

00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:55.180
Yeah.

00:59:55.180 --> 01:00:01.180
I was just talking to somebody this morning about the Bryn Ivar care home.

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:02.180
Bryn Ivar care, yep.

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:04.180
He was brought up in Castleton.

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:05.180
Oh yeah.

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:09.180
And he said their only water was from a spring.

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:10.180
Was it?

01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:11.180
Yeah.

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:13.180
For the first ten years of his life.

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:14.180
Good Lord.

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:16.180
He's a bit 90, you know.

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:20.180
Is there anything else you'd like to ask him that we haven't asked?

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:22.180
I don't think so.

01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:25.180
Shall I switch it off then?

01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:26.180
Yeah, kind of fine.

01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:27.180
No problem.

01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:28.180
I hope I haven't missed anything.

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:31.180
But you've got an opportunity to add stuff and take stuff away.

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:32.180
Sure, that's okay.

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:33.180
Is that okay?

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:34.180
Yeah.

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:35.180
Thank you.

01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:36.180
No trouble.

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:37.180
Thank you.

01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:39.180
That's just bang on an hour.

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:40.180
Oh, that's fine.

01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:41.180
Yeah, yeah.
