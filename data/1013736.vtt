00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
Like that a wonderful song from England

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.500
He'll come back, I believe.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.100
I'll be your man, ever,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.900
And I'll love you, I know you'll be.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.500
I'll be here, to the temple,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.100
And I'll die, I know you'll be.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:05.600
Brightly coming, in the midst of my humanity,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.400
I'll forever round your shelter,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.500
For your thunder and your blast.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.200
Round your body, shining brightly,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.300
Reaching forth in freedom's path.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.900
He'll be staring, in the dark land,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.400
Where the holy riot rides.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.700
Round your body, shining brightly,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.300
For your force is reaching wide.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.800
Round your body, shining brightly,

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:57.300
And I'll love you, I know you'll be.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.000
I'll see you, for your riot,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
When I'm with you, I'll be with you.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.500
With the ending and the heartbreak,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.000
He'll never be like his father.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.500
He'll be leaving, out of the woods,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.200
On the water from the pond.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.900
He'll arrive at the cold land,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.600
Where the morning will be.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.300
I'll be your man, in the cold land,

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.100
For your holy land, in the land.
