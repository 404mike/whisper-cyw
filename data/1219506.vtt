00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
That should be recording now.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.520
Yeah, I think that's going.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:21.200
This is Jim Barrett interviewing Danny Thomas at his house on the 9th of April 2018.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.700
Danny signed the project consent form.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:32.700
This interview has been recorded for Wunderbras 25 project funded by HLF Cymru.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.500
OK, off we go.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.060
So when did you actually join Wunderbras, Danny, do you know?

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.700
I think it must have been about at least 15 years ago.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.620
I can't remember the date exactly.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:00.620
It was, I just tried to start a blues group a little bit before and that hadn't been successful.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:15.620
And I happened to notice a poster, I think it was in the station saying Taff Ely Street Band, anyone can join and sing where the practices were.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.620
And so I put my guitar and went over to see.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:28.620
Taff Ely Street Band, so it's probably more than 15 years, probably more like 20 I should think.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.620
I'm not quite sure when it turned from Taff Ely to Wunderbras.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.620
Yeah, the poster said Taff Ely, I think it had just changed.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.620
Yeah, by the time I joined.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.620
You are one of the very early members.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.620
Not the very, very early.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.620
I think, well I was told they started with about nine people, didn't they?

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.620
Yeah.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.620
It had grown a bit by then to about 20.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.620
OK.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.620
And you started, you were playing tenor saxophone?

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.620
Not to start with.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.620
I took my acoustic guitar the first time.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.620
All right.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:18.620
And they found out that it was, acoustic guitar was impossibly too quiet.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.620
So I broke the electric the following week.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:35.620
And I played that for I think two years before I started getting interested in saxophone and stuff.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.620
OK.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.620
I can't remember you playing guitar with Wunderbras.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.620
Yeah.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.620
If you remember, I was playing guitar when we went to Vienna.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.620
All right.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.620
Yeah.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.620
Yes.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.620
It was a later stage.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.620
I picked up the saxophone.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:02.620
Well, it was meeting all kind of people playing brass instruments really, Wunderbras encouraged me to.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.620
To start playing.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.620
Start playing saxophone.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.620
Yeah.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.620
So did you get lessons then on the saxophone?

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.620
Not to start with.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.620
I have since then occasionally.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.620
Mostly taught myself.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.620
That's impressive.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.620
Was guitar your first instrument?

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.620
Yes.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.620
OK.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.620
And how long had you been playing the guitar when you joined?

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.620
I'd been, well, quite a long time really.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:47.620
I started playing guitar when I was about 12 or 13 years old.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.620
But yeah, and I pretty much taught myself again.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.620
Yeah.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.620
What I first sort of found joining Wunderbras, it was like it did different kind of worlds.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.620
I'd been used to kind of rock bands and blues bands.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:14.620
And it was a completely different genre really in which people were talking about sevenths and ninths.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.620
Yeah.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.620
All kinds of things like that.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.620
And a lot of people could read music and I was not really able to do that.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.620
Yeah.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.620
So that's why you went over to saxophone?

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.620
Partly, yeah.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:49.620
I was playing the kind of chords and I was not really understanding a lot about the melodies and soloing and stuff.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.620
And one of the reasons going over to saxophone was to get a more of a grasp of that.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:06.620
I felt that it was there in the background, but I couldn't articulate it and actually play it.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.620
Yeah.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:17.620
And what was Wunderbras like when you joined it with those people?

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.620
In sort of what way?

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.620
Well, was it what you expected when you actually saw the notes and went along?

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.620
No, not really.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:40.620
But because people were talking about things, sort of musical things that I didn't really, jazz things.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:49.620
And lots of people knew about people like Miles Davis and John Coltrane and I never heard of him.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.620
So he was like a bit of a shock really to the system.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.620
Okay.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:05.620
And also musically, I realised things like timing wasn't good.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:15.620
There were lots of things that made me like punching the stomach really to start with.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:22.620
But it made me think, well, you know, did give me a challenge to, you know.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:33.620
And also like playing in keys that, you know, guitarists don't normally do like E flat and E flat.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.620
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:43.620
Challenging. But did you feel comfortable with the band?

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:49.620
I think so, half and half really, a little bit overwhelming in one way.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.620
But yeah, there were some good people there.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:59.620
Yeah. And Vienne, that's a trip that I didn't do.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.620
I can't remember why I didn't do Vienne.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.620
I sort of came and went a bit with One Debrass because I was up in London a bit higher.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.620
We're actually recording the moment, but never mind.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.620
Is that right?

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.620
I thought you'd recorded the moment.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:35.620
Yes, I don't remember you from that period when I started, but then you did, I remember you coming back into One Debrass, I think, around the time of Breck and Jazz.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.620
Yeah.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.620
Yeah, I was probably playing double bass then, was I?

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:48.620
What were you playing? No, I don't think you were.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.620
Oh, then it must have been bass clarinet.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.620
I think it was bass clarinet because, what were they called?

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:01.620
They were two women, one young girl.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.620
Oh, Joanna.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:12.620
Yes, that's it. And then there was, I think that's someone else, another woman, which I can't remember her name.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:18.620
Yes, I should know her name.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.620
Anyway.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.620
So how did you like going to Vienne? What did you think about that?

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.620
Oh, that was great, really.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:36.620
It was a new kind of experience again.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:46.620
And the end itself was spectacular, the stadium and all that.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:55.620
And yeah, it was great.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:04.620
Are there any other sort of standout gigs or events with One Debrass?

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:09.620
I'll try to think. Some of the other festivals.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:17.620
Breck and Jazz could always, was good quite often, I think.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:29.620
The times when you went down really well, it seemed to suit that kind of street thing.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.620
We did, yeah.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:40.620
That I'm trying to think of.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:50.620
Oh, we went down to Denise's Wedding. That was great.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:55.620
I just, the location was really...

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.620
The Druidstone Hotel.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:58.620
Yeah, that's it.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:59.620
Out in West Wales.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:00.620
Yeah.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:08.620
Yeah. Have you been out there many times or, because there was a sort of habit of One Debrass going out there quite often.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.620
I didn't go again with One Debrass.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:19.620
Right. Okay. There is another One Debrass wedding coming up.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.620
The Druidstone Short actually.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.620
Okay. So yeah.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:37.620
Anything else that you sort of remember about the band or your experiences in it?

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:52.620
Well, it, another kind of thing was the Ponti Jazz Club, which was closely associated with One Debrass.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.620
And that has kind of kept going.

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.620
Yeah.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:01.620
Even though One Debrass moved down to Cardiff now.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.620
Yeah.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:14.620
And, yeah, I still, there's something to do, I've got friends with a lot of people that were One Debrass people, like Charles.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.620
Yeah.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.620
And Dave Moroe.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.620
Yes.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.620
And Derek and stuff.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.620
Yeah. Well, Derek and Charles are still playing with the band.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.620
Yeah.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:34.620
Dave Moroe, no, he's off doing other stuff.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:39.620
Have you been doing other stuff yourself since One Debrass?

00:11:39.620 --> 00:12:00.620
Yeah, I kind of was involved with a band that started in work, which started off as a soul band, then drifted more into kind of Latin and soul.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:11.620
Which I did that for about four years, but it's difficult to keep a band together, really, personalities and stuff.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.620
Were you playing saxophone or guitar?

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:18.620
I was playing both, actually, depending on the song.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:19.620
Yeah.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:25.620
Yeah, it was very enjoyable.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:37.620
Is that something that's, I mean, do you think if you had not been in One Debrass that that's something you would have done?

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:47.620
I think, well, I wouldn't have started playing the saxophone without being in One Debrass.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:53.620
I think I've always had the urge to be doing something in music.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:13:00.620
So I probably would be doing some kind of a band or maybe trying or maybe dreaming of being in a band.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:21.620
But, yeah, it, but One Debrass did have a big influence on some styles of music and, you know, and playing the saxophone and stuff like that.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:26.620
So why did you actually cease being part of One Debrass?

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:31.620
I think, well, a number of reasons.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:38.620
I think I slightly got fed up at times with it.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.620
I think it's inevitable, really.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:57.620
And I suppose I wanted to do something more like write my own tunes and have more control over my own band, really.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:04.620
To move towards doing that, really.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:08.620
Good.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:30.620
And we got this project 25 when we're getting quite a few old or ex-members, I should say, oldies of the press, the long term, ex-members, because nobody's as old as me, ex-members, sort of coming back, not necessarily to rejoin as much as to just do a bit of One Debrass and meet up.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.620
Would you be interested in getting involved?

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.620
Yeah.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.620
Okay, we'll have to talk about what might be possible.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.620
Okay, thanks a lot, Danny.
