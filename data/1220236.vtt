Why I knew I had this very keen ear for music was that I went with my mother on a Thursday morning to go and get a live chicken.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So we walked up the hill to I think this Mrs Bailey's place and I don't know what the procedure was but the chicken got put in the bag,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:33.000
alive with its head poking out of the bag and we used to get on the bus, the number four bus and go to town to Clarence Place where there was a butcher shop,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:48.000
a non-Jewish butcher shop but for the purposes of the kashrut, the Jewish kosher dietary laws, they made a part of the butcher shop kosher or kosher enough anyway for the minister to do his work.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So we used to take this chicken there and there would be bits of meat there as well that was kosher and he would take it in the back and do what he had to do and 20 minutes later we put the dead chicken back in the bag, get back on the bus and go home.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And while I was on the bus I used to sing, I must have been two, three, four, I don't know exactly how old I was, and my mother used to tell me that people in the bus were absolutely flabbergasted because I could sing music while you work.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So that's how I knew that and that was a memory of a religious thing and it's kind of important in my psyche and in my background.
