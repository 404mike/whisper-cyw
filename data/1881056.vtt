00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We had one bad moment.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You know, they sent some of the people from the Isle of Man to Australia.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And we had a letter from my father to say he was being sent to Australia.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And the ship was sunk.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And only ten people were saved.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And the BBC announced the names, and my father's name was amongst them.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And we waited for about a fortnight.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And then he was only allowed to ride once a month.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And he had got on the ship.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But being absent-minded, he'd forgotten his passport for the September.
