00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.460
Black and white, white and stickers on my hair...

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:53.920
A newsorry flower meeting before the door the full moon

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:12.040

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.540
The herald angels sing,

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.040
Glory to the newborn King.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.540
He has come down from the dark,

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.040
And in the evening rain he comes,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.540
And in the evening rain he comes,

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.040
Our glorious evening feast.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.540
Glory to the newborn King,

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.540
When the hills are all clear,

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.040
Our glorious evening feast.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.540
Glory to the infant King,

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.040
Glory to the newborn King,

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.540
Glory to the infant King,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.540
Glory!
