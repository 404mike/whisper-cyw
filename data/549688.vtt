00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Yn y fater o'r fywyd, rydw i'n gwybod pam yw'n ddod, a'n gwybod, oherwydd bod hi'n ddod yn y ffyrdd,

Roedd hi'n cael ei ddod yn y ffyrdd ffyrdd.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Roedd hi'n cael ei ddod yn y ffyrdd ffyrdd, ond roedd hi'n cael ei gweithio ar y ddau.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Roedd hi'n dweud bod hi'n gallu dod o weithio yn y barthau'r ffyrdd oherwydd roedd hi'n cael ei gweithio ar y ddau a ddechrau ei ffyddydd.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Roedd hi'n cael ei gweithio ar y ddau fel gweithwyr,

Mae'n fel gweithgwyr gweithgwyr, gweithgwyr gweithgwyr,

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.800
yn y ffordd, ond rydych chi'n ymgyrchol, yn ymwneud â, dwi ddim yn gwybod,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.800
dwi ddim yn gwybod o ran oeddiadau, ond dyna lle mae fy fater yn gweithio

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.800
ac yn mannaf yn y ffordd.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.800
Mae'r fater, roedd yn fawr o ffamiliau gwahanol

Roedd yn ffyrdd, a'r ffordd.

Pan oeddwn i'n geni, dwi ddim yn gwybod beth yw.

Felly, ymgysylltu, roeddwn yn y penllyn.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.800
A yna, roeddwn yn...

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.800
Roedd fy fater oedd yn rhaid i mewn i ddod

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.800

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.800
A'r ddigwyddodd, roeddwn yn mynd i Wokdil eithaf

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.800

Rwy'n dweud, nid oedd yn berson.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.800
Ond, mae'r iawn, yn bod ymlwg,

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.800
roedd nhw'n cael y bus i'r penllyn.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.800
Felly, roeddwn yn mynd i'r ddigwyddodd newydd

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.800
o Wokdil, y byd,

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.800
y byd yn ddim yn fwy anhygoel.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.800
Mae'n, yn ymgysylltu,

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.800
nid yn byd y byd, ond roedd oedd ymgysylltu cwestiwn.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:41.920
ac yn d Jongern diogeluom o 계ll rhan, y dechrau chi, ok an Emmoch, phen y mod emphas y gallwch ei Malaysia'n un الت.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.360
i fy fater, mae hi'n mynd yn ôl pan oedd yn 86, am 3 neu 4 mlynedd yw.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.040
A mae hi'n byw yno i fyny yn ôl. Yn hynod, mae fy motha wedi'i ôl yn ôl cyn yma,

00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:00.000
oherwydd roedd hi'n alseimau a, yn trafodol, mae fater yn cael ei wneud yn ei hap a mae

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.920
roedd hi'n cael ei edrych arnyn nhw iawn. Rydyn ni hefyd wedi edrych arno a hefyd wedi edrych ar fater.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:11.760
Felly, yna, yn Oeddyl, rydw i wedi'i datblygu Ysgol Mordyn ysgol Mordyn,

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.680
ond, ysgol Mordyn ysgol ymlaen, pan ddod oedd yna, a ddod oedd yn ystod y rôl, ac yna,

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:22.560
wedi'i trafodol i Ysgol Mordyn ysgol Mordyn ysgol Mordyn. Rydw i wedi'i ddod o'r LN+,

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:30.480
ddod oedd yn ffyrdd, yn ymwneud â phethau oherwydd y pethau ymgyrchol. Ond rydyn ni wedi,

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.880
yn ffortunol, yma, yn y rhan yma, roedd ysgol mordyn ysgol mordyn ysgol mordyn.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.880
Felly, y bobl wedi'i ddod oedd y ceri, ond, yn ffyrdd, y dydwod ddim. Felly, os ydych chi'n ddod o'r LN+,

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:52.480
dyna yw'r hyn i'r dydwod, ond y bobl ydyn nhw ym 12 oed yn gallu ymdrech ysgol tec.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.480
Felly, roedd y pethau yma yn ysgol mordyn ysgol mordyn.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:04.320
Yn ystod hynny, roedd y pethau ysgol mordyn a'r ysgol tecno yn amlwgio. Felly, fe ddaeth ymlaen

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:10.320
ysgol mordyn ysgol mordyn. Felly, rydw i'n mynd i fynd i ysgol mordyn ysgol tecno

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:18.480
a'n ffyrddol, ddaeth gwych, ddaeth gwych, a'r pethau ysgol mordyn oherwydd nad oeddant

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:24.480
ganddyn nhw'n gallu cymryd yn ffacilitaeth, maen nhw'n amlwgio'r pethau ysgol

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:31.840

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:39.280
bobl, ond i ffyrddau Christmas, roeddwn yn allu i ddod yn ysgol mordyn,

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:47.440
a felly roeddwn yn gysylltu â'r pethau, yn ymdrech ymdrech y ffyrdd. Mae'r teimau ffwrdd a'r teimau

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.160
a'r teimau'r rugby a'r cricet, maen nhw'n amlwgio'r pethau, felly mae'r bobl o'r tec

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:58.320
a'r bobl o'r ysgol mordyn, roedd yn ffyrdd un teim, yn ysgol mordyn, ysgol mordyn,

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:06.960
beth oherwydd, ysgol ysgol ysgol. Felly, roeddwn yn dda yn dda yn dda yn dda,

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:13.960
yn feddwl gandda, ddim yn gwych, ond ddylai, cydnmind包

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.600
byewn bake denke a'r holl.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:26.400
Ghirau cricet, cathodren rugby a pheth iawn fel hyn, a fi wneser y d Faed gyfin.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:34.160
ac fe ddechreuais y llwybrau oedden nhw, a ddod o'r 4 o'r ffordd, yn unig.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:40.000
A wedyn roeddwn i'n mynd i fynd i'r gweithredu'r ddau'r ddau,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.480
a roeddwn i'n mynd i ddod o'r ddau'r ddau,

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.000
neu beth sy'n cael eu llywodraeth,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.440
roeddwn ni wedi'i ddweud yn ymwneud â'r hyn.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.800
Rydw i wedi'n gwybod beth sy'n cael eu llywodraeth.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.960
Ond nid oeddent yn cael unrhyw un.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.760

ond nid oeddent yn cael unrhyw un.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.800
Felly roeddwn i'n credu,

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.080
well, roeddwn i'n mynd i fynd i ddau oedden nhw,

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.400
roeddwn i'n mynd i ddod o'r ddau.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.480
A, yn ffortunol, yn y ddau hynny,

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.720
roedd yna ddau oedden nhw'n gallu allan

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.480
i'r ddau llwybr,

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.880
y ddau gas,

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.720
y Cymru Gwladol,

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.560
y cyfansoddiadau telefon,

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.840
y Swythiaid,

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.280
Arcan,

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.840
roedd yn cael un oedden nhw.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.040
Ond fel yr un o'r hyn,

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.040
roedd angen i chi ddod yn y ddau.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.560

rydym yn mynd i ddod y coleri.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.160
Nid oedd.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.880
Nid oedd yn ymddygiad.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.680
Roedd yn dweud, roedd yn dweud,

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.640

Yn y ffordd, yn y ddau hynny,

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.560

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.480
Ond, yw hynny dweud,

roedd yn dweud,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.360
mor gyflym.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.280
Ac rwy'n gallu ddod,

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.120
yn ddeall,

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.280

Amdanynnydd,

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.840

Nid oes gennych amdano amdano am yr hyn a'r hyn yn gwybod yw,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
rwy'n eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn amgylchedd.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Mae'n amlwg yn fwy o fawr,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
yw, dweud,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
nid dweud yn ymwneud yn y ffordd,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
oherwydd mae'n gweithio bwysig,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
ond roedd gennych rhywbeth technol,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
yn ymwneud gyda

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
gweithio mewn gwirioneddol,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
rywbeth yn cael ei wneud.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Felly,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
amgylchedd, ond beth?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Amgylchedd leyrwyr?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Amgylchedd mecanicol a gynhyrwyr?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Beth?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Dwi ddim gwybod. Dwi ddim yn gwybod.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Dwi ddim yn gwybod ymwneud hynny.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Dwi amdano amgylchedd.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Felly,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
roedd gennych ymgyrch a

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
ooo

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
roedd yna 300 neu 400 o bobl

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
yn ei wneud,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
yn ystod ystadell. Y dyddwn i'n mynd yno,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
roedd fel,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
o,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
roedd ymgyrch yn fwy o...

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Ie, amser, a

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
a beth o bobl wedi eu gael?

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Ah, roeddwn yn cael ei gael.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Erm,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
beth o bobl?

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Y dyddwn i'n mynd

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
a dyma'n ddiddorol,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
a dwi wedi cael ffotograff o'i,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
100 o bobl.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
A dwi

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
ddim yn gwybod efallai

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
ein cymdeithas o'r Saesneg Cymru

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
oedd yn cael 100 o bobl

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
yn un peth.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Yn ystadell, oes yw?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Ie, rwy'n mynd,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
yw, mae'n ddiddorol.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Mae'n ffrindio yn ystadell,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
erm,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
ei ffrindio gweithio yn Alcan.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Nid oeddwn i'n gallu

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
gael ffom i'w llwyddo

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
ar unrhyw ffrettiad yn Alcan.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Rwy'n mynd i'r Ysgrifysgol

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Gramaethol.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Mae'n ffrindio yn ystadell,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
yn ystadell unrhyw ffrettiad

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
a dwi wedi cael unrhyw ffrettiad.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Oherwydd roedd y peth yma yn ystadell.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Yn ystadell,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
nid yw'r hyn sydd ydych chi'n gwybod,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
mae'n peth ydych chi'n gwybod,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
ac mae'n ffrindio, yn unrhyw ffrettiad,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
yn Alcan, a dwi ddim yn gallu.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Ond, Chris yn fwy,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
mae'n fwy o'r gwybodaeth ymlaen

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
yn ystadell.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Ond, roedd y peth yna yn ystadell

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
ac mae'n dda i gyd yn ystadell

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
bod y ddau yn cael ei chwybodaeth

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
o'r bobl ychydig.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Ond os,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
roedd y peth yn ystadell,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
ond os yw'r pethau yn cael 5 o'r aprentis,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
neu 10 o'r aprentis,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
dwi'n credu bod Alcan

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
yn cael, efallai, 25 o'r aprentis,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
oherwydd, ond y swyddiad

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
o'r aprentis 100 o'r aprentis

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
oedd

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
llawer o bobl.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
A i wneud beth, yna?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Roeddwn yn mynd yn ystadell

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
fel aprentis enghreifol

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
mecanigol.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Felly, yn ystadell,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
gyda

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
ffynu

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
yn ystadell,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
gallwch chi gael aprentis aprentis,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
a hynny'n dweud,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
roedd ymwneud yn ystadell

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
neu ganddyn nhw i gyd am ystadell.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Ond y Swyddiad y Swyddiad

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
oedd yn ffantastig.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Yn ystadell, maen nhw'n

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
gysylltu newydd.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Roedd yn ystadell ysgol,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
roedd yn ystadell ysgol,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
ond maen nhw nid oes

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
yn ystadell ymwneud yn ystadell.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Felly, maen nhw'n gysylltu system newydd

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
yn hollol.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Roedd yn fel mynd i ysgol, i ysgol.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
I'r un ystadell,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
nid oes yn ystadell.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Oedd yn dda i ddod yn ystadell

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
a gweld rhywun neu

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
gysylltu â rhywun.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Nid oes yn ystadell.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Roedd yn ystadell 100%

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
yn y clasrwm

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
neu yn ysgol

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
sy'n bwysig.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Mae'n dda i ddod yn ystadell

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
yn y clasrwm.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Roeddwn yn gweithio ym mhobl

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
a'r rhwng ysgol.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Roedd yn fel ysgol.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Roedd yn ystadell

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
yn ystadell

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
yn ysgol.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Roeddwn yn mynd i ddod yn ysgol.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Roeddwn yn mynd i ddod yn ysgol.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Felly, yn ystadell,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
roedd yn fel ysgol,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
ond roedd yn cael eu gynhyrchu.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Mae'n gwybodaeth iawn o £2.15

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
yn y penny.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
A beth oedd yna'r hwn yn ystadell?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
1964

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
1964

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
A roedd yn

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
1618

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
1617

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
1617

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Mae'n rhaid i mi ddod

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
mae'n dda i ddod yn ysgol.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Ond, yn ôl i'r

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
NCB,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Gary Hall, sy'n fy nghymdeithas

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
o'r ffyrdd,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
roedd yn ysgol

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
yn ysgol,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
a'r fater i mi ddod yn ysgol.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
A'i pethau cymdeithasol

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
roedd £10 y ddod.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Fy mwyn yn £2.15

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
ac mae'n fater

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
wedi'i ddod,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
roeddwn yn cael eu gynhyrchu

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
yn ystadell

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
yn ysgol.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Mae £2.15 yn y penny

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
oherwydd rhywbeth,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
roedd yn cael ei gynhyrchu

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
i ddod yn ysgol.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Nid oes unrhyw beth

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
yn ysgol

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
yn fy nghymdeithasol,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
ond roedd fy fater dweud, roeddwn yn eich ddod

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
i ddod yn ysgol, a roeddwn yn cael ei gynhyrchu.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Ond, roeddwn yn gallu ddod

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
yn ysgol, a'n bod

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
£7.50 mwy o bethau o blynyddoedd.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Ond, nid oedd y fath o'r fath.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Roeddwn yn eich ddod

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
oherwydd gallwch gael

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
amgylch, sy'n cael eu gynhyrchu

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
yn ysgol.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Ond,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
yn bwysig, roeddwn yn ysgol

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
yn llawer, ond roeddwn yn gweithredd

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
ar y gwaith.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Ond, gallwn i chi ddweud, roedden ni'n

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
yn ôl i'r ddau yma,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
roedd yna unrhyw ddau

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
ddau?

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Rwy'n gwybod.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Rydw i'n cael ffotograff o'r ddau.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Roedd yn un o'r ddau ddau

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
ddau yn cael eu gynhyrchu

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
yn ysgol.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Roedd yn un o'r ddau ddau ddau

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
yn ysgol.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Ond roedd yn gwneud yr hyn rydym yn gwneud.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Roedd yn mynd yn y llwybr yn dda yn ystod.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Roedd yn...

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
roedd yn dda yn ystod.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Roedd yn dda yn ystod.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Roedd yn ystod

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
i ni.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Felly, roedd yn...

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Dwi ddim yn gwybod.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Sir Alfred Nicholas yn un man sy'n ddafn.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Roedd yn...

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Roedd yn ymwneud ymlaen.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
A roedd yn cael ei gweithio

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
ar gyfer ymwneud

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
o...

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
o... eu gweithio.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Felly,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
er bod yn cael hyn

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.520
Roeddwn yn gwybod am y magne.

Felly roeddwn yn dweud,

Roedd hi ddim yn gweithio yn y ffyrm.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.520
Felly, ymlaen,

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.520
roedd hi ddim yn gallu i bobl

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.520

ac fe wnes i gael ffordd i Manchester.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.520
ac fe wnes i gael ffordd rydym yn dweud,

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.520
a gafodd,

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.520
dyma'r ffyrm yn dweud,

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.520
a gafodd,

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.520
dyma'r ffyrm yn dweud,

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.520
a gafodd,

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.520
ddwy i'n mynd i

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.520
ddod, roeddwn yn dweud,

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.520
dydw i'n gael ffordd gyda'r cyhoeddiadol,

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.520
a'r hyn yn dweud,

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:31.520
Yn ystod y ddau, roeddwn i'n mynd i'r traen, a'r ddau ffryddi, yn ôl i'r Ysgrifysgol, Val yn cael gweithio.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:36.520
Felly roeddwn i'n ei wneud hynny am y ddau, pan oeddwn i'n ei wneud rhyw fath o traen.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:43.520
A roeddwn i'n mynd i America, hefyd, i'r cymdeithas y gallai ei wneud y gysylltiad hwn yn America.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:53.520
A roeddwn i'n mynd i Manchester, oherwydd ym Mhryd yn Wilmslow.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:59.520
Roeddwn i'n gweithio yn ystod ym Machosfield, a hynny'n mynd i'r holl fath o ddau.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:05.520
Ond roeddwn i'n cymryd y cael ei wneud y gwmpas o'r holl fath.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.520
Mae'r holl fath yn ystod ym Machosfield, y peth y maent yn ymwneud â John o'r Grotts.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:14.520
Mae'r unig rhannol y maent yn cael ei gweithio gyda'r gweithwyr yma, a'r holl fath yn cael ei wneud yn y pub.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:21.520
Felly, am ymwneud â Switchgear, roeddwn i'n gwybod am y pwynt o bwysigau am y pwmpas yn Switchgear.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:25.520
Oes gennych chi ddweud ym mhwm Switchgear?

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:29.520
Pa fyddwch chi'n gweithio ym mhwm Switchgear?

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:34.520
Ym mhwm Switchgear, roeddwn i'n gwybod bod y pwmpas yn ymwneud â'r holl fath.

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:39.520
Felly, roeddwn i'n gwybod bod y pwynt o bwysigau am Switchgear.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.520
Pa fyddwch chi'n gweithio ym mhwm Switchgear?

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:49.520
Ym mhwm Switchgear yw'n cymdeithasol, a dwi'n credu bod yn unrhyw ganddyn nhw'n gweithio ar ddwy miliwn o bobl.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.520
A beth yw'r peth?

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:56.520
Mae'n ym Mawr Llewyr. Mae'n cael ei gweithio yn Mawr Llewyr.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.520
Mae'n cael ei gweithio yn Caerphilly. Mae'n cael ei gweithio yn Aberbargwr.

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:05.520
Mae'n cael ei gweithio yn Treforest.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:11.520
A wedi cael ffotograff o chyflwyno gweithio ar un seils.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:19.520
Yn Pont Llewyr, roedd hi'n cael gweithio llawer o bobl trwy gweithio ym mhwm Switchgear,

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:25.520
ond roedd hi hefyd yn gweithio yn un peth o'r ffactrwyr,

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:30.520
lle roedd hi'n cael gweithio mwy o bobl,

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:36.520
ac roedd hi'n cael insulatrau elettricol.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:39.520
Rwy'n credu bod hi'n cael ffotograff o hyn,

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.520
oherwydd roedd hi'n cael gweithio mwy o bobl ym mhwm Switchgear,

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:46.520
yn y ffactrwyr.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:51.520
Roedd hi'n cael gweithio'r tyfist, ond roedd hi'n cael gweithio ar y llwybr.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.520
Roedd hi'n cael gweithio ar y ffactrwyr ym Pont Llewyr?

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.520
Roedd hi'n cael gweithio ar y 1,500 o bobl.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.520
Mae'n gweithio'n dda iawn.

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.520
A beth o bobl yma?

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:08.520
Roedd hi'n cael gweithio ar y 150 o 200 o bobl ym mhwm Switchgear,

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:14.520
ond roedd hi'n cael gweithio ar y canthin,

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.520
ar y canthin,

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.520
ar y ddwyfnodau gweithio,

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:25.520
a roeddwn i'n gwybod llawer o'r bobl.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:29.520
Roedd hi'n cael gweithio ar y canthin, a beth oedd nhw'n ei wneud?

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.520
Roedd hi'n...

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.520
Os ydych chi'n ei ddod o...

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.520
Os ydych chi'n cael rhyw ffyrdd,

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.520
yn y ffyrdd yn ymddygiadol,

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.520
er mwyn i ffyrdd,

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.520
fel bod rhywun ddim yn cael y canthin,

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.520
rydych chi'n ei wneud ymddygiad arno.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.520
Felly, os ydych chi'n cael gweithio ar y canthin,

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.520
mae'n ymddygiad arno arno arno.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.520
Wel, yn y Switchgear,

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.520
os ydych chi'n ei ffyrdd,

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.520
roedd hi'n dda i'r canthin,

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.520
roedd hi'n rhywbeth yn fwy fwy o'ch llwybr,

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.520
neu yn fwy fwy fwy o'ch llwybr,

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:03.520
ac roedd hi'n cael ei ddod o'r ffyrdd

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.520
gyda'r araldaid materiol,

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.520
sy'n gweithio ar y canthin.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.520
Felly, roedd hi'n cael y canthin

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.520
sy'n cael,

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.520
yn cael, neu'n cael,

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.520
gwybwynt

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.520
o'r barau gopar

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.520
a'i gysylltu

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.520
mewn gwaith elettricol

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.520
ar gyfer

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.520
gysylltu

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.520
llwybr hyfforddol.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.520
Felly, dyna'n un o'r gweithiau mawr.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.520
Yna,

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.520
fe wnaeth chi ddod o'r gwaith

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.520
a'i ffyrdd

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.520
a'i ffyrdd

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.520
yn gweithiau

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.520
a'i ffyrdd

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.520
yn cael pethau o'r ffyrdd.

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.520
Felly, os ydych chi'n meddwl am fwy

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.520
pethau i'w gael ar y llwybr,

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.520
dyna'r ardal y maen nhw'n cael,

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.520
ond yna, wrth gwrs, rydych chi'n cael

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.520
gwybwynt arall ar gyfer y ffyrdd.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.520
Felly, pam yw'r gweithiau

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.520
yn gweithio ar y pethau hynny,

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.520
yn ymwneud?

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.520
Dwi ddim yn meddwl amdano amdano amdano

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.520
oherwydd, gallai bod wedi bod man.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.520
Ie.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.520
Nid oedd yn cael eu gael amdano amdano.

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.520
Ie.

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.520
Dwi'n meddwl y byddwn yn ymwneud

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.520
ar hyn oherwydd, yn meddwl amdano amdano amdano.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.520
Ydych chi'n gwybod beth maen nhw'n cael?

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.520
Nid, dwi ddim wedi…

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.520
Ydych chi'n cael…

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.520
Ydych chi'n cael…

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.520
Ydych chi'n cael mwy o'r mhen.

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.520
Os ydych chi'n

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.520
ymwneud y pethau yma

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.520
ac ydych chi'n gwneud yr un pethau ysgol,

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.520
mae'r man yn cael mwy o'r pethau yma.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.520
Ac mae hynny…

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.520
yn ogystal â beth o bryd,

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.520
dwi ddim yn cael unrhyw ffordd amdano amdano.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.520
Yn ystod hynny,

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.520
dwi ddim yn cael unrhyw ffordd amdano amdano amdano amdano.

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.520
Er mwyn i'r pethau yma,

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.520
gallai chi'n meddwl amdano amdano amdano.

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.520
Ond dwi ddim yn credu bod mwyaf

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.520
yn ymwneud yn ystod hynny.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.520
Nid oedd yn gwybod amdano amdano

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.520
bod ymwneud yn cael mwy o'r pethau yma

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.520
fel y person dda.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.520
Nid oedd yn cael rhai o'r pethau yma,

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:01.520
ond mae'r hyn yn dda amdano amdano amdano.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:05.520
A oedd yn cael mwy o'r pethau yma?

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:09.520
O, ie, mae'r pheiriaid wedi cael mwy o'r pethau yma.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.520
Ond mae'r pethau yma…

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.520
Y pethau yma…

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.520
Mae'n…

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.520
Mae'n…

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.520
Byddwn i'n fwyaf amlwg,

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:21.520
tysgu £2.15 ap o dan.

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.520
A rwy'n credu bod yn amlwg

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:29.520
yn amlwg 6 mlynedd, roedd hi'n mynd i 3 pwns a 10 pens. Mae hynny'n dda i'r

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:35.520
cyfle ddaf yn ymwneud, nid oes yn dda iawn, ond 5 silegion a ddod oedd ymwneud.

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:41.520
Mae'n dda i'r ddod o ddod. Ond pan ddych chi'n credu, rwy'n meddwl,

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:47.520
rwy'n meddwl, yw'r hyn yn gwneud yn unig, fel awyrwyr,

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:53.520
roeddwn i'n gweithio y ffotbol i'r tîm ffotbol 2 o'r gweithio,

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:59.520
a roeddwn i'n cael £1 i gyd. Mae fy nghyfnodau o £2.50 a £1 i gyd

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:05.520
i gyd i ffyniadu rhywbeth a ddod oeddwn i'n gobeithio, a'n taxt.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:11.520
Roedd yn awyrwyr, roedd nhw'n cael fy £1 a'n taxt. Mae rhai o'r mlynedd sydd

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:15.520
yn cael eu gyd yn yr oed, yn y 30au,

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:19.520
roeddwn yn cael eu gyd a'n taxt.

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:23.520
Roeddwn yn cael eu gyd a'n taxt.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:27.520
Ond, iawn,

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:31.520
ond, iawn, i ddweud unrhyw ddiddordeb am y gweithiau,

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:35.520
a oeddwch chi'n mynd i'r gweithiau? Rwy'n meddwl, roeddwn i'n meddwl,

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:39.520
oes, yn y ffactor.

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:43.520
Mae'r

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:49.520
ystafell arloddau, fel ei roedden nhw'n cael, ydy'n gweithio. Roeddwn yn cael ei gyd

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.520
a ddod oeddwn yn cael ei gyd yn yr oed.

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:57.520
Roeddwn yn cael ei gyd yn yr oed.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:01.520
Rwy'n meddwl y peth y ffocbal. Mae'r ffocbal, oherwydd rwy'n

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:05.520
gwybod, y ffocbal i'r teim, gallwch chi ddod yn yr oed yn y ffactor.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:09.520
Roedd fel cael y clwp ffwrdd.

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:13.520
Gallwch chi ddod yn un peth ac yn siarad â unrhyw un oherwydd eu bod yn fwydol yn y ffocbal.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:17.520
Gallwn i ddod yn y ddod, a dydw i ddim yn ymddiriedig,

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:21.520
ond gallwn i ddod yn un peth yn siarad.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:25.520
Ac wrth gwrs, wrth gwrs, nid oeddwn i ddim yn gweithio yn y ddod, a roeddwn i'n

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:29.520
dda i ddod yn y ddod, o ran unrhyw beth. Rwy'n cael ei ddod,

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:33.520
a'n gweld beth y byddai'r ddod yn ei wneud.

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:37.520
Roeddwn yn...

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:41.520
yn dda i ddod yn un peth yn y ffactor. Nid oeddai'n bod yn dda i ddod yn unrhyw beth,

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:45.520
ond roeddwn yn dda i ddod y cymdeithas newydd ac

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:49.520
roedd y ddod yn ydyn nhw oherwydd yna y byddai'n

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:53.520
gweithio ar y peth newydd y ffactor. Roedd yn newydd newydd, technoleg,

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:57.520
yn y ddod. Felly roeddwn yn dda i ddod ymddygiad, a roeddwn yn dda i ddod

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:01.520
y ffactor, oherwydd yna'r unrhyw beth y gallant eu gweithio. Nid oeddai'n bod yn

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:05.520
oes yn y peth i'w brydio'r mhen o'r ddod neu unrhyw beth. Nid oeddai'n fwy o hyn.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:09.520
Ond os oes gennych chi ddod ymddygiad, roedd hi'n rhaid i chi ddod ymddygiad,

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:13.520
oherwydd nid oedd yn mynd ymddygiad, nid oedd yn y rhan normal, roedd hi'n

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:17.520
oed yn dda i ddod ymddygiad o'r unrhyw beth, ond roeddwn yn dda i ddod ymddygiad a'r

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.520
ffactor.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.520
Ond roedd hi ddod yn unrhyw beth. Roedd hi'n gweithio, roedd hi'n

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.520
cydwys, roedd hi'n cyllideb. Roedd hi'n gweithio, roedd hi'n

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:34.520
ddod yn dda i ddod, roedd hi'n cyllideb. Nid oedd hi'n gweld yn unrhyw beth

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:39.520
unrhyw beth oherwydd roeddwn yn cael ei gweithio.

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:44.520
Mae'r unrhyw ddod yn dda i gyd, ond roeddwn yn dda i'w ddod ymddygiad.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:48.520
Roeddwn yn dda i gyd, roeddwn yn dda i gyd oherwydd roeddwn yn mynd i'r

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:51.520
ystafell, roeddwn yn dda i'r ffactor.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.520
Felly yma'r ddod yma, roedden nhw'n ymwybodol yn eich hun?

00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:00.520
Mae'r un o'r ddod yn ymwybodol.

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:07.520
Yn y un rhan o'r section, yna'r enw oedd Sheila.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.520
She was a lovely woman.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:14.520
She was ten years older than me.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:22.520
But at that time, Betty Holly had a song called Sweet Little Sheila.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.520
I know I've ever seen her, Blue Eyes in the Ponytail.

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.520
And I used to sing that.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.520
What was Betty Holly?

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.520
Or something wrote.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.520
I used to sing that to her.

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:37.520
And she used to smile and whatever.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:42.520
I got on great with Sheila and then she got in the family way

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:46.520
and became very plump in a maternal fashion.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.520
She never came back to work.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:55.520
Like quite a lot of ladies in those days, they would work until they had a family and then disappear.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:00.520
But up in the drawing office we had tracers.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:05.520
There was a section, all women.

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:09.520
One, two, three, four, five, six.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.520
It might be six or eight.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:17.520
And they were not drafts people,

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:21.520
but they would take the drawings that the draftsmen did

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:25.520
and they would trace them onto a...

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:31.520
All day they would put tracing, we call it big tracing paper, over these drawings

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:34.520
and make them and ink them in.

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:39.520
Whereas it was in pencil that the draftsmen did it, they would go over it with ink

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.520
and then they would photocopy.

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:46.520
These were the, what we would call, hard copies today.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:49.520
So there were six women there.

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:57.520
In amongst a photograph, I think, of the women in the drawing office.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:01.520
So they did a non-technical job.

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.520
They were called tracers.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.520
But there were six of them there.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:16.520
Now, typing pool, they had a huge typing pool in the switch gear.

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:21.520
The amount of people they had there, they had lots of typists.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:24.520
Copy typists, all sorts of typists.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:36.520
On the shop floor, other than that one section where there was a designated area,

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:43.520
there was the paint shop where they had half a dozen ladies.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:46.520
They were wonderful, they got on great with them.

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.520
They just did the job like any other man.

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:54.520
They were degreasing, is the word.

00:37:54.520 --> 00:38:00.520
If you had metal products and they'd been worked on,

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:06.520
very often then they had dirt on them or grease or oil.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:12.520
In the paint shop, they had these half a dozen ladies

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:16.520
and they worked in the most atrocious conditions in some ways.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:20.520
Because it was degreasing.

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.520
What's the word for it? I forgot.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:32.520
They had these huge vats and they used to wash them in tetrachloride and it stunk.

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:37.520
Today, I think, it's sort of banned because it made you lightheaded.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:42.520
These women worked there five days a week alongside the men.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:48.520
Other than the fact that they had long hair, which differentiated them,

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.520
you couldn't tell them from the men because of the overalls they worked.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.520
They worked their socks off in the art department.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.520
And they were paid less, of course.

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.520
They were paid less, I'm sure.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:06.520
Because equal wages, well, you can tell me.

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:11.520
I know that they fought for it and eventually got it,

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.520
but it's not that long ago, really.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:19.520
So I definitely weren't paid as much as the men.

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:21.520
1970, you could say.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.520
But I don't think some of them got paid.

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:31.520
Even then, unscrupulous people didn't pay the ladies that much.

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:36.520
So yeah, definitely weren't paid as much.

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:39.520
Can I ask you now then?

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:44.520
Because I'm going to ask you about when you were a sales rep later on.

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:50.520
What was the relationship like between the men and the women in Switchgear?

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:55.520
Was there any harassment either way?

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:58.520
I don't think so.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:02.520
I wasn't naive as a young lad.

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:07.520
In any way, shape or form, I'm sure there must have been.

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.520
In fact, I think it was the other way.

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:12.520
I think the women played merry hell with the men.

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:16.520
Well, that's what I was asking, either way.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.520
You were a young lad.

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:22.520
What was it like walking into a room full of women?

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:28.520
I used to sometimes feel a bit nervous, but I used to treat them.

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:29.520
How did they treat you?

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.520
Very well.

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:33.520
I got on very well with most of the women there.

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:38.520
Not in a sexual way or anything like that.

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.520
I think they were wonderful women.

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.520
They just got their heads down.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:47.520
If you worked in that department 52 weeks of the year type of thing,

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:51.520
you might have had everything else in life.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.520
Did they use to tease you though?

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:56.520
Oh, yeah, they got teased rotten.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:01.520
Nothing and towards, you know, a nice bum or something like that.

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.520
They used to say things like that.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.520
Oh, good gosh, yeah, but that's what off the duck's back type of thing that would be.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:08.520
Oh, yeah, but this is what I'm asking.

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.520
What kind of things did they use to say?

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:14.520
Oh, really, you know, what are you doing tonight?

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.520
I don't know.

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:19.520
Do you have a nice time with your girlfriend?

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:22.520
Do you want to take me to the pictures?

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.520
I'm not saying they did it to me.

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:30.520
Whether it was me or whether it was half a dozen boys that went in there or the men.

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:32.520
I just don't know.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:38.520
I didn't fancy myself in that way, but I was confident.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:43.520
But a lot of women can make you very nervous.

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:48.520
Were these older women teasing you or were they women the same age as you?

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:51.520
I think the older ones were worse than the younger ones.

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.520
But it's in our life.

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:55.520
Did you enjoy it?

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.520
Oh, yes, thoroughly enjoyed it.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:01.520
There was, you might not have.

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:02.520
Although you felt nervous.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:09.520
Well, the nervousness, I think after about five minutes nerves went out the window.

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:13.520
I don't think a man wouldn't enjoy a couple of women giving you a bit of banter.

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:16.520
It was not crude.

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:19.520
It was lighthearted.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:22.520
And I would accept that.

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:34.520
I have always drawn a line, bad line, with work ethics, is that I can swear like anyone else.

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:37.520
I can swear better than anyone else.

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:43.520
But when ladies are around, my etiquette is very good.

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:47.520
Some of the women's etiquette wasn't as good.

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.520
What was their language like?

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.520
Industrial language could come out.

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:54.520
It was quite funny.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:43:03.520
You could possibly know someone who you saw walking up the high street in Blackwood with their husband.

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.520
And they smile and say, hello, Bill.

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:11.520
And then in work, they could be quite crude and rough with you.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:14.520
But you didn't think any different of that person.

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:17.520
It was just work, out of work.

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:31.520
Whereas today, I think a lot of, some women, some young girls today, the language, just walking up the street is worse than anything I've heard in some factories.

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:36.520
But that brings us back to the way they've been brought up, I think.

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:39.520
I've been brought up, inverted commas, proper.

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:45.520
Some of these ladies will say, well, I did have hair in those days, a good head of hair.

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:51.520
It would curl, but it wasn't vindictive.

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.520
Nothing. Nothing like that.

00:43:54.520 --> 00:44:08.520
I think if someone became, you know, go away and they meant it and put all the language in with it, that's different to having a bit of banter and a bit of a language comes in.

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:11.520
That is slightly different.

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:17.520
But of course, and I've always said this, women can use it to their own advantage.

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:22.520
So tell me, how old were you then when you became a salesperson?

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:25.520
I was 22, 23.

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:30.520
Right, and eventually, did you come back to Wales or you did sell in?

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:32.520
I came back to Wales.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:39.520
Yes, so tell me about selling. Where did you sell in Wales? Name some of the factories for me.

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:49.520
Right. I worked for a firm called White Child and Beanie, which were called WCB Containers, which were one of the biggest suppliers of material handling.

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:54.520
In Britain.

00:44:54.520 --> 00:45:08.520
Now if I said to you they made everything from a sun-blessed bread tree to a walled sausage tree, that is a bakery equipment handling, mixing vessels.

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:12.520
That was just a small part of it.

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:16.520
Basically, there wasn't a factory in South Wales or Wales.

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:33.520
My area was up to Aberystwyth, across to Newtown, down to Herriford, came down to Chepstow and from Chepstow to St David's.

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:36.520
That was my area in South Wales.

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:45.520
And there wasn't basically a factory that I couldn't go into that could use the equipment, the packaging equipment that I was selling.

00:45:45.520 --> 00:46:13.520
I went from everywhere to food manufacturers, to textiles, to electrical, the Sony's of this world, electrical assembly companies, bakeries, meat processing factories.

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:18.520
So I went to, you name it, I went to it.

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:23.520
And nearly every one of them had a woman working in there, or a lot of women working in there.

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:29.520
Alexon in Pontypridd, garment manufacturer.

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:33.520
95% women.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:37.520
Burton's Biscuits, Cwmbran.

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:45.520
Quite a high percentage of ladies working there on the packaging lines, putting the wagon wheels in and everything.

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:49.520
Then it became quite automated so some of the women disappeared.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:53.520
What was it called when you went there? Was it called Burton's?

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.520
Yeah, it was called, it was Westons originally.

00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:59.520
Westons Biscuit Factory.

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:01.520
And then became Burton's.

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:12.520
And then there was Lovells in Newport, who made cakes and everything and they made the cake for our wedding.

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:28.520
Val was working in Newport and she knew one of the girls in Crompton Sun and Web, who was another company I used to go to, knew someone in Lovells and they said, oh we'll get you a wedding cake then at a reasonable cost.

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:30.520
So we had a wedding cake made there.

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.520
But Lovells also made sweets.

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:41.520
Triang Pedigree in Merthyr, they made toys, prams.

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:47.520
The Burley Bra Company up in Textiles, we all know the uplifting job they made.

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:50.520
Well there was Cora's in Aberbargood.

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:55.520
Val's sister worked there as a supervisor and they made for Marks and Spencer's.

00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:00.520
250 women? 300 women?

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:04.520
Maurice Cohen, named for Marks and Spencer's.

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:10.520
About 150, 200 women in Aberbargood, in Pengham.

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:13.520
Ivana Bakeries, Cardiff.

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.520
Ivana Bakeries, Rochester.

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:17.520
Hundreds of women.

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:20.520
All on the production line.

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:26.520
Being abused by many of them.

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:30.520
Meritz, the Bakers in Cardiff.

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:33.520
They've changed it now.

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:37.520
I think it became Memory Lane or something eventually.

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:42.520
I'm not absolutely certain on that because the grey matter is often.

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:45.520
They were creaming cakes.

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:49.520
So there was lots of women doing the creaming cakes.

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:53.520
Gossards in Pont Lomfrith, my sister worked.

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:56.520
They made foundation garments.

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.520
Hundreds of women in there.

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.520
150 perhaps in that one.

00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:05.520
British Telecom Abercarne.

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:10.520
Massives of women worked there.

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:14.520
Some of them there, 30 and 40 years.

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:17.520
They made telephones for British.

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:20.520
British Telecom made their own telephones in those days.

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:24.520
You couldn't buy a telephone other than the British Telecom.

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:29.520
If you wanted a telephone, you had to have a British Telecom phone.

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:32.520
That was the only phone.

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:37.520
Eventually, it was a free market.

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:42.520
You can get telephones of any shape, size, colour or everything.

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:45.520
In the old days, you had a few choices.

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:49.520
It was the old telephone that we traditionally brought up with.

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:52.520
They opened the market.

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:55.520
They made the trim phone.

00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:58.520
Remember the first trim phone?

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:01.520
They went from the old handset to the trim phone.

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:04.520
Eventually, they opened the market.

00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:07.520
Anyone could do it.

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:12.520
If you had a telephone in your house, you had to have a British telephone phone.

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:15.520
It was a very popular phone.

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:18.520
They said you can have anything you want.

00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:21.520
They started refurbishing.

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:27.520
Instead of shutting down, they refurbished telephones for their own systems.

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:30.520
That was a very big employer.

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:33.520
How many did you say again?

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:36.520
They must have had 200 or 300 women in there.

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:39.520
Gosh, or more.

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:42.520
We've talked about standard telephone in Caerphilly.

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:47.520
We've talked about standard telephone and cables in Tree Forest.

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:50.520
Are there any people in there?

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:53.520
I think there were two factories.

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:56.520
There might have been 300 or more in there.

00:50:56.520 --> 00:51:02.520
When you think about it, where have all these women's jobs disappeared to?

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:05.520
Hills Industries in Caerphilly.

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:08.520
They made rotary lines.

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:12.520
There were 60 or 70 women in there.

00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:15.520
Strads in Caerphilly.

00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:18.520
Strads made men's suits.

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:21.520
It's a sewing factory again.

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:24.520
I'm not certain how many worked in there.

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:27.520
I only ever used to go into the warehouse.

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:30.520
I never went on the shop floor.

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:37.520
The job that I had, inside my briefcase, I had a little note for myself.

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:40.520
I'm delish, isn't it?

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:43.520
Walk the system.

00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:46.520
If you can go inside a factory and see what they're doing,

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:49.520
you can sell more to that factory than if you sat in an office

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:52.520
just talking to someone and saying,

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:55.520
I can do this, I can do that.

00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:58.520
Some firms would let you go in or take you around.

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:01.520
You couldn't go on your own, but you could go around.

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:04.520
You had an idea of how many would work there.

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:07.520
Then there was another company.

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:10.520
You wouldn't go past reception.

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:13.520
That was it.

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:16.520
The only way you might know is looking at the size of the factory

00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:19.520
and have a guess.

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:22.520
Why do you think that was?

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:25.520
It was just company policy with some of them.

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:28.520
No reason other than that.

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:31.520
Johnston, which is a comparatively new company,

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.520
you couldn't go in their factory unless you had 24-hour clearance.

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:37.520
Health and safety in those days.

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:42.520
The walls, that wasn't in Wales.

00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:45.520
That's a different one, so I won't even mention that one.

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:48.520
There was stadium across the road from Strads in Caerphilly.

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:51.520
They made crash helmets.

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:54.520
They had all these women in there assembling crash helmets

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:57.520
for motorcyclists and for the army.

00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:02.520
The men who were in the tanks, they used to have their helmets

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:06.520
made by Strads by stadium in Caerphilly.

00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:10.520
There was Aer or Zip in Tree Forest.

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:14.520
That was a huge site, but a lot of it was automated.

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:19.520
I couldn't say, if I went into a room, there were 50 women,

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:22.520
because they were so big.

00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:25.520
It could be 200, but then you didn't know where they were.

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:30.520
Or if they even had 20, because the machines were so automated.

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:35.520
It was a huge place, but I don't think they employed that many ladies.

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:38.520
They could have.

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:42.520
It was the Rizzler Cigarette Factory in Tree Forest.

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:49.520
I'm only covering the area that you mentioned that you were interested

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:54.520
rather than West Wales, because I used to go down to St David's.

00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:58.520
These are only the ones in this particular area.

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:03.520
Lourteries, where Val worked, I've worked on it.

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:07.520
I tried to get her, but she's adamant. It's amazing.

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:11.520
She'll sit there talking to you, and she'll come and talk to you.

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.520
There we are.

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:18.520
They changed their company name from Lourteries to Crompton Sun and Web.

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:26.520
They made RAF uniforms, police uniforms, fire brigade.

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:31.520
I think there were 250 workers there.

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:41.520
Val used to have to get up at 5am to catch a bus to Newport to work and come home.

00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:49.520
I know it's only 16 miles, but it's quite a distance in the 60s in some ways.

00:54:49.520 --> 00:55:00.520
Well, up in Bryn Maw, there was the Britain Shoe Company, and you had the Tough Boots.

00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:04.520
They made the Tough Boots, or they were part of that group.

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:07.520
They had different factories, and different factories made different products.

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:11.520
I got a feeling they made some Tough Boots up there.

00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:18.520
They employed lots of sewing machinists.

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:24.520
A lot of these are sewing-oriented or textiles.

00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:26.520
What's happened in this country?

00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:31.520
Textile industry is in comparison zero.

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:34.520
Marks & Spencer takes their work away.

00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:37.520
They're not criticizing Marks & Spencer.

00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:40.520
Actually, they were one of the longest to hold out.

00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:48.520
They kept their business in Britain longer than the British Home Stores or Littlewoods.

00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:56.520
They had to go with them or sink because they were getting their products made cheaper in the Far East.

00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:01.520
It intrigues me. Where have all these ladies gone?

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:09.520
You showed us an illustration about Hoover.

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:11.520
You think about it, making washing machines,

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:17.520
there wouldn't be much potential for ladies working in a factory like Hoover.

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:20.520
But yes, you've got a photograph to prove.

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:27.520
As I said to you, the box on that line was one of my boxes that I sold to them.

00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:30.520
Or I sold them a replacement.

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:35.520
Depending on when that photograph was taken, it could have been someone prior to me.

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:39.520
That's what my product meant there as well.

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:48.520
Up and down the valleys here, from Cardiff West to Chepstow and up to Abergavenny,

00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:52.520
One of the biggest, OP chocolates.

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:56.520
I don't know if you've talked to anyone in OPs.

00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:58.520
Yes, I have.

00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:02.520
Hundreds of ladies. Fantastic women.

00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:06.520
Going out on fire, I was sitting at home.

00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:12.520
I'm not like a balloon because I used to have so much chocolate from OP chocolates.

00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:17.520
A really nice cross section of people.

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:22.520
Merthyr have had a drubbing over the years about some people saying I was rough.

00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:24.520
The Gurnoffs and all that.

00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:27.520
Most of these women were from the neck of the woods.

00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:31.520
Wonderful people, OP chocolates.

00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:34.520
OP chocolates and gossards.

00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:40.520
Gossards, that's the one place where I have gone bright red.

00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:45.520
They played me like a...

00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:48.520
Oh dear me, I had to spend...

00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:53.520
I had to go on a shop floor to measure up for some stuff and bite down.

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:57.520
I was in my 30s.

00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:02.520
I thought I knew stuff, but they really...

00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:08.520
Not shot me, they didn't frighten me, but they nearly frightened me.

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:10.520
So what did they do?

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:17.520
Anything and everything verbally was a fair game.

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:24.520
It was nothing I hadn't heard before, but it was constant.

00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:32.520
You'd think they were sex starved or something like that because it was all sexual.

00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:36.520
But that was the place as well.

00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:40.520
I went into this room and the manager was there with me.

00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:44.520
In walks this girl and she says, what do you think of this fit?

00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:51.520
And she walks in with her new bra on and knocks on the door.

00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:56.520
It's a new style and he wanted his comments on something and there's me.

00:58:56.520 --> 00:59:02.520
Man of the world, she's from her waist up, it's just a bra.

00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:06.520
He's going up and twanging it but not in the bottom.

00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:09.520
Oh yeah, that stitching is alright.

00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:13.520
And that's unnerving in some ways.

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:20.520
But yeah, that one cooled my hair in that one.

00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:22.520
I came home and I told the hell about that.

00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:30.520
Because I could fight back if I was measuring something, stretching up.

00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:32.520
I like your trousers down.

00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:34.520
I'm waiting.

00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:40.520
You just have to come up with a little straight back.

00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:45.520
Were you ever physically molested?

00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:48.520
No, not in Nero.

00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:50.520
Or was it verbal stuff?

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:51.520
All verbal.

00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:54.520
Or I've had my bum pinched.

00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:55.520
I've had my bum pinched.

00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:58.520
I can't remember who it was.

00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.520
Yeah, I've had my bum pinched.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:05.520
But it didn't take any notice in any way, shape or form.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:08.520
So how did it make you feel?

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:16.520
It's like everything.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.520
Was it alright all the time?

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.520
No, no, no.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:24.520
It's like you get a situation now at Christmas.

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:30.520
I've been to functions where I've had nothing to do with the gang, the people.

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:33.520
It's a shared function.

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:40.520
And you have a work's outing, a work's day, Christmas function.

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:44.520
And you get a gang of women who wouldn't say, be baboo to anyone.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:48.520
And they get a couple of drinks inside them and they're totally different.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:56.520
And I think in some ways in the work environment, not every factory, you wouldn't expect it.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:06.520
But as a man, there's nothing I could do about it anyway if I was that way inclined.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:09.520
And it wasn't that bad in any way, shape or form.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:12.520
But were you ever really upset by their behaviour?

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.520
No, no.

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:18.520
Do you think the majority of women were like that or was it just a small minority?

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:21.520
I think it was always a small minority really.

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:28.520
And you could have a situation where I know it's totally false Coronation Street.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:31.520
And you've got a factory there, a sewing factory.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:40.520
And WCV is just a complete, sorry, Rita Faircloth.

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:46.520
Her husband, Dennis, worked for WCV Containers, the company I worked for.

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:51.520
They were man and wife when she was started off in Coronation Street.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:02:02.520
And when Coronation Street first came on, in the sewing factories, all the equipment, the boxes, the sewing, were supplied by WCV Containers.

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:06.520
And they tactfully had logos WCV on there.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:16.520
But if you watch Coronation Street, the banter on there is not crude.

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:30.520
And I think, you know, if it's acceptable at 7.30 on a television, and I know it's a television thing, it was no worse than anything like that.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:31.520
Nothing.

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:34.520
But the language was often worse, wasn't it?

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:37.520
The language was...

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:49.520
No, the thing is, as you were passing through, you only picked up some F words that they would have heard of.

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.520
That's last night.

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:54.520
But that was a work environment.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:03:01.520
And I don't think it was vindictive or malicious in any way, shape or form.

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:04.520
But not working...

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:09.520
I, for example, I went to a company.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:15.520
And their attitude was brilliant when I used to be there.

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.520
And they offered me a job.

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:20.520
And I'd been offered jobs many a time by people I used to call on.

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:23.520
And I eventually did go to this company.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:38.520
But when I went there to work full time, to when I used to call in on a weekly or every two weeks, it was totally different to when I worked there full time.

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:44.520
And I think I was passing through some of these factories.

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:49.520
I mean, OP Chocolates, I used to go to OP Chocolates every Wednesday.

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:55.520
Every Wednesday, 52 weeks of the year, other than holidays.

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:59.520
So I was part of their furniture.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:05.520
I had a white overall from OP Chocolates rather than having to go and find a white overall.

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:11.520
And basically I could walk anywhere in that factory and the girls were brilliant.

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:21.520
I was going to say, if you were a familiar figure, did that make you more of a target or less of a target?

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:24.520
And you said that one factory changed when you...

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:27.520
Yeah, I think in some way you might be right there.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:34.520
And that as a visitor, I'll perhaps say, I've been a total stranger walking through when I went to...

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:40.520
It's only one incident.

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:46.520
I know it's not in Newark area, but it was in St David's in Slimmer Slacks.

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:48.520
And they crucified me.

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:51.520
And I'd never been there before in my life.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:54.520
Very nicely crucified me.

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:57.520
So they had no compulsion.

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:03.520
I think the manager said, Mr. Moses is coming up to measure up for some new equipment.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.520
I'm leaving him to it.

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:09.520
And that was it.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:14.520
He went and I was left to sort everything out.

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.520
I didn't need him to own my hand.

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.520
So they didn't know if...

01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:23.520
All they knew was I was a supplier, but I could have been a senior director of the company.

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:26.520
But oh, by damn, they gave me some stick.

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:27.520
What did they do?

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:28.520
Oh, all the verbs.

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:31.520
You have your trousers down, Ethel, you want to watch her?

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:35.520
She's laughing tomorrow as you're going to bike shed.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:39.520
Nothing really bad.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:45.520
What do you think that women behave like that in factories?

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:46.520
Bravado.

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:49.520
I don't know, you could come up with quite a bit.

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:54.520
Perhaps they were prudes in the house and they just changed in work.

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.520
I just don't know.

01:05:55.520 --> 01:06:02.520
I've been to Christmas functions and someone you know won't say be baboo to someone.

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:07.520
Whether it's one drink or half a dozen drinks, they're different.

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:10.520
But there is alcohol involved.

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:11.520
There is alcohol.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.520
And it's not in work.

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:15.520
Not in work, I quite agree.

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:18.520
I don't know.

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:26.520
I wouldn't say that all women have been like that throughout my working history.

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:29.520
But men are.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:33.520
And I think they just acted the same as men in some ways.

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:41.520
I've never been there when they're talking about their sexual relationship with their husbands,

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:44.520
but I've been with men when they've said,

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:48.520
me and my wife, whether that's bravado or what.

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:54.520
Val is the one that she should be talking to.

01:06:54.520 --> 01:07:04.520
What she used to tell me what happened around the canteen table was shocking.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:10.520
The sexual harassment from fathers and uncles and what have you,

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:15.520
which is totally different to the work environment, but that's how the girls used to talk.

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:20.520
It was like nothing was sacred.

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:22.520
They'd talk about anything.

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:27.520
Do you think in a different age then where things were much worse for women,

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:31.520
do you think in some ways it was sort of payback time?

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:37.520
Yeah, well they were in some ways put on in comparison to today.

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:45.520
The women would appear to have less freedom in those days than today.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:50.520
The word was to be seen and not heard.

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:54.520
But when you were in a new working environment, you could be heard.

01:07:54.520 --> 01:08:04.520
But do you think in some ways, you were implying now that maybe there was harassment going on in different areas of their lives,

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:07.520
and in some ways it was payback time?

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:11.520
Oh yes, I suppose you are. Put your men down again. Put the men down in some ways.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:15.520
It could be. But that's a generalisation.

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:25.520
In principle I could go up to these factories and they'd just get their head down and they'd look up and just get on with the work.

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:30.520
It was only occasions that you had the banter.

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:38.520
How often did you mix with women from different factories on a social level?

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:48.520
Well I used to go out to lots of opi chocolates social events.

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:53.520
I was invited. I could go. With Val.

01:08:54.520 --> 01:09:02.520
I'd never been to any function other than with Val to any work stores.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:06.520
So you'd be invited by the different factories?

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:09.520
Yes, I'd been invited. I used to get on very well.

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:18.520
I know it's not here, but there was a massive company called Ward and Goldstone in Manchester, Salford.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:23.520
They had a factory in St Helens, I think it was.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:29.520
The factory manager said to me, see that door there, it's locked.

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:35.520
Do not step outside that door at this time of the year. It's Christmas.

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.520
There's no drink in the factory, but they're wild. And he's the manager.

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:45.520
It was like Christmas was freedom time.

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:50.520
We've been to a couple of functions.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:54.520
At Park Davies I've been invited to.

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:58.520
I had a good relationship with lots of the companies I used to go to.

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:03.520
So I meet some people outside work as well.

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:12.520
But I have met some of the ladies who are in uniform.

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:16.520
And then you see them outside and you say, you've got legs!

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:19.520
They had trousers on.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:25.520
And you'd see someone, and I'm not being sexist or anything like that,

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:33.520
you put a standard uniform on 500 women and they're just white coats and you don't know anything about them.

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:37.520
They've got their hair in a hat of some kind.

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:41.520
And basically you don't realise that they've got hair down here and even beautiful.

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:45.520
And I was like, my God, I didn't know that was you!

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:53.520
So there are signs that you see someone very much in a different light to them on a short floor.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:11:01.520
Because in the bakeries they had to be covered at the toe really and you just saw the face.

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:05.520
You've talked about a couple of factories here.

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:14.520
Do you think a certain type of factory, in your experience now then,

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:18.520
when you were walking in there as a man,

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:23.520
do you think certain types of factories are worse than others?

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:34.520
Er, well, there's some factories that are there for earning money.

01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:37.520
There were women, that's what they wanted to do.

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:40.520
They went in at 8 o'clock.

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:44.520
If they went in at about 7, they'd go straight on their machine because they were on bonus.

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:47.520
They weren't interested in having a conversation with someone.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:52.520
They just got their heads down and the world could fall around them

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.520
and they just got on with it.

01:11:54.520 --> 01:12:01.520
So, no, I couldn't say there were any of them different.

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:08.520
I couldn't say a sewing factory was one sewing factory or all the sewing factories are the same.

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:11.520
They were all totally different.

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:20.520
Let's say they didn't take any notice of you walking around and they'd just give you a glance and get on with it.

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:25.520
So the type of work they did didn't really affect their behaviour?

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:26.520
No.

01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:31.520
That's a good point, whether they were on bonus or not.

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:33.520
So the money is more important than the bounty, isn't it?

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:38.520
Yep. Unfortunately, valiant of time.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:43.520
She'd go in and if it'd be 15 minutes break,

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:48.520
they didn't necessarily have 15 minutes break because they wanted to get back to their machine

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:53.520
because they were on peace work.

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:59.520
They'd fight amber and tongs.

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:02.520
As a woman, I make no...

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:08.520
If I say it, it's got to be said, there's different sized boobs, correct?

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:10.520
Val was making bras.

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:13.520
She said to the one supervisor one day,

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:17.520
Are we not making any small bras at the moment?

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.520
Yes, we're making small bras.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:23.520
They're coming through as many as the big bras.

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:27.520
Well, I seem to be having all big bras.

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:31.520
Val didn't know, but the girl who was doing the same job as her,

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:34.520
there was only the two of them doing this particular job,

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:40.520
she was sorting out small, big, small.

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:42.520
She was getting all the smalls.

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:47.520
Peace work, to make a big bra, takes more time than a small bra.

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:53.520
And you had women doing that, that to that degree.

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:59.520
So Val stopped behind after they went to break

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:02.520
and she took all the small bras off this girl

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:05.520
and put all the big bras on there and never said a word to her,

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:08.520
but it never happened again.

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:12.520
But some of them were as crafty as that to get to...

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:19.520
So they were there to work and they were there...

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:22.520
It's cheating in some ways.

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:25.520
It isn't cheating because he's still doing the job,

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:28.520
but it's an easier job.

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:34.520
Crofton and Webb were in Valis, they weren't...

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:41.520
They had work boxes, they'd have garments in parts

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:45.520
and then you'd pick up a work box and then you'd make the garment.

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:48.520
Or you'd make the part that you were doing.

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:53.520
Because they'd have specialist machines to put a zip in.

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:57.520
So one girl did all the zips, then she'd put it back in the box

01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:00.520
and it'd go down to the next girl and she'd put something else on it

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:02.520
and it goes to the next.

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:05.520
Sometimes they call it make-through when you make a garment

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:09.520
from beginning to end or as Val was doing,

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:12.520
she was doing one specific job, pass it to the next girl

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:15.520
who did something else.

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:20.520
There was a couple of them doing it and they were on piecework

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:25.520
and she said one of the girls would get up and pick up three boxes

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.520
and take all the work.

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:31.520
When she started working then as a youngster.

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:34.520
But she wasn't strong enough eventually.

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:37.520
She'd go, ahhh, I had to sit down over there.

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:40.520
She'd say, oh, get a sore.

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:43.520
She stood up to this girl, never happened again.

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:46.520
So women can be quite bitchy in work

01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:49.520
and that's the piecework side of it.

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:54.520
So on some of those things, my experiences are only through

01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:58.520
second hand comments from my own wife.

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:03.520
So other than that, walking through a factory on a regular basis,

01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:09.520
OPs, Burton's Biscuits, Park Davis, Warner Lambert,

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:13.520
you walk into Park Davis, Warner Lambert

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:18.520
and sometimes the only way you could tell if it was a man or a woman

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:22.520
is if she went into the ladies and he went into the gents.

01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:26.520
You've saw that much of their face.

01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:29.520
What did they make there? Drinks.

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:32.520
So just their eyes? Yeah.

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:36.520
If they could get them to pluck their eyebrows and eyelashes,

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:39.520
they would have done it that.

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:43.520
So you couldn't even tell if they didn't talk to you,

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:48.520
if it was a man or a woman because an overall makes you all look the same.

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:52.520
And where was that factory? Park Davis, Pontypool.

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:55.520
Unfortunately shut down.

01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:58.520
Lots of women there.

01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:01.520
They made the birth pill.

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:04.520
It was an old factory.

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:09.520
The other one that had quite a few women there was Girlings

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:13.520
for an engineering works, assembling stuff.

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:17.520
So how long did you do this work for?

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:20.520
Erm...

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:23.520
In Wales? In Wales.

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:26.520
Erm...

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:29.520
20... Let's see.

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:32.520
God, Val, where are you?

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:35.520
It was like...

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:38.520
I'm going to read Corrugate, isn't it, Castle?

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:41.520
20 odd years?

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:44.520
20 odd years.

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:47.520
All right, I went from...

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:52.520
No, actually, as a rep, sorry, take it all back.

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:56.520
I left WCB, I was thinking of WCB containers.

01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:01.520
Then I went to a firm called Read Corrugated Cases and made cardboard boxes.

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:06.520
And everything you have comes in a cardboard box.

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:11.520
So the same factories that I was selling for WCB,

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:16.520
I was going to Burton's Biscuits selling cardboard boxes.

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:19.520
Opie Chocolates, cardboard boxes.

01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:22.520
Gossards, cardboard boxes.

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:26.520
So instead of stuff that was in the shop floor for the manufacturing process,

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:29.520
it was the finished item that was being put in there.

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:32.520
So I was still going there.

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:37.520
And that's why Read Corrugated, one of the reasons I got the job,

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:42.520
was that I had contacts in all these other places.

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:47.520
A very large company over here was Motils.

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:52.520
And they virtually became baby sterling.

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:56.520
And again, they made petri dishes.

01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:01.520
They made all types of things like that for the medical industry.

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:04.520
And that was full of women.

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:09.520
And Keith, who was the manager,

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:12.520
was a very good friend of mine,

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:17.520
and he said, I don't know what happens on the night shift.

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:20.520
I don't know what happens on the night shift.

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:23.520
Because he said the things that,

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:28.520
the stories that he used to hear, he couldn't,

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:31.520
he couldn't confirm happened.

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:36.520
But if half the stories that he was told happened,

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:41.520
he didn't know what the night shift were doing.

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:43.520
And your mind goes over.

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:46.520
So what were the stories then?

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:50.520
Sex behind the pallets and all things like that.

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:53.520
The ultimate things that went on there.

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:56.520
But that's man and woman.

01:19:56.520 --> 01:20:01.520
Not, and, well, c'est la vie, that's life.

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:05.520
You can put all the things in to stop things,

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:09.520
but where there's a will, there's a way, as they say.

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:15.520
And we were walking through the shop floor in the warehouse,

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:18.520
and there was a condom on the floor.

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:20.520
And he went wild.

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:22.520
Absolute wild.

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:25.520
I don't know what the end result was.

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.520
And it wasn't a finger stall.

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:30.520
Because they used to use finger stalls.

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.520
It was a condom.

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:34.520
He went wild.

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:36.520
So these things happen in life.

01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:41.520
But I don't think, after the war, was there this...

01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:44.520
sexual emancipation?

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.520
I don't know.

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:50.520
It didn't happen for me in the 60s.

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:54.520
I was around, but it passed me over the top or something.

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:56.520
I don't know why.

01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:58.520
Something happened.

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.520
Free love?

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:02.520
I don't know anything about that in some ways.

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.520
I'm perhaps naive.

01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:06.520
I don't know.

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:10.520
But the innuendos and all the things in the factories,

01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:12.520
I just used to take.

01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:17.520
It was nothing vicious or in any way, shape or form,

01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:20.520
as far as I was concerned.

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:24.520
I wasn't naive enough to think that...

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:30.520
I don't think I've ever been compromised to the degree

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:33.520
that I felt attacked by a woman.

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:37.520
And you didn't ever feel physically threatened?

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:39.520
No.

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:41.520
I wish I had been.

01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:45.520
Valmwt, no.
