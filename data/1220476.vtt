00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.660
And then I was sent away to school and there I met the assistant organist who was a sadist,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.680
a top quality sadist.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.220
And he had a very interesting way of encouraging you not to make mistakes.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:26.920
He had a large ebony ruler which was like a stick of rock, big, about 14 inches, inch

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.320
thick in diameter.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.680
If you made a mistake, tap.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.400
Next mistake, tap, tap, harder.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.560
And then you're starting to think, oh, let me not make mistakes.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.120
And then you made more.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.480
And one day he went crazy and smashed the hell out of me.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.480
I was bleeding.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.440
He didn't put my eye out but it was terrible, unbelievable.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.520
I ran away from the school.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.920
I ran to the station.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.480
I just jumped on a train.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.080
I wanted to get away.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.360
This was in the evening.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.240
I had, you know, I just had nothing else.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.240
And the train took me, to my amazement, to Cardiff where it finished.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.440
Here for Cardiff.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.560
And I was very, very ill.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.000
I had what they would call in those days a major nervous breakdown.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.120
I was put in St. David's Hospital and that was really a dreadful time for me.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.640
I was then about 14.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.120
And that was the end of my first period of life.
