00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Yes, so one of the most interesting periods I think, certainly for me, was the few years leading up to the Millennium.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So the villager decided that it wanted to celebrate the Millennium and I think there was a little bit of Millennium fever around the whole country really.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And we established a Millennium Committee and I was asked to chair the Millennium Committee.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And there were various subgroups of that Millennium Committee.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So we had a subgroup which was concerned with writing the Millennium book.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And Diana's father, Willie Griffiths, was in charge of that and it didn't get finished in his lifetime of course.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And Roger has manfully carried that on and it was printed just a few years ago.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So that took a long time.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
But there was the tapestries, so the wall hangings in the village hall.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
They were all created by largely the women of Abbeycomere, although I did do several myself.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Mary Strong and I drew most of them for them to be done, which was fantastic.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And the Village Green, and I was in charge of seeing the Village Green done.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And we did a lot of fundraising events.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We raised a lot of money, certainly to procure the Village Green, to pay for the book.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And those events themselves were absolutely fantastic.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Lots of fundraisers in the village hall, lots of walking treasure hunts I organised,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
barbecues, picnics, quizzes and that sort of thing.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And most of the money we made by selling cans of beer as you might expect.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
That's a good way of making money in Abbeycomere and raffles and so forth.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We did raise a lot of funding, really brought people together.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It is a village that does come together for a celebration, particularly those that are 8 to 80 and everyone can join in.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And that was fantastic.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And just the events for instance of the tapestries.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So some of the other things just happened and took time.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:18.000
But the women's meetings, the weekly meetings they held in Victoria's Kitchen up at the hall were fantastic.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Paul at the time was working away in the personnel department at Royal Dalton Stoke and Trent.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And he would get home, I don't know, worked very long days, got home 9 o'clock or past 9 o'clock.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And the ladies would all be in the kitchen through several bottles of wine by that point in time.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And they would sew and chat and that went on for a number of years.
