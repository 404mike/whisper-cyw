Hi, I'm Mandy.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.480
Awakening the senses.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.560
Feeling the warmth of the sun soaking around your body is like being wrapped up in a big

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.600
hug from the sky.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.400
Sitting on the grass with heightened senses is a special gift.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.120
Feeling the vibration rising from the earth, the energy and life coming from Mother Nature,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.120
rising up to meet you, gently holding you.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.800
Listening to nature breathing around us can help us to reconnect with our soul and to

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.920
be at one with our spirit and surroundings.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.720
This reawakening of our spirit and soul can help us to find our authentic self, to live

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.800
as nature intended, living peacefully, joyfully, authentically.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.960
Pacha Mama Sige Dando.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.240
Mother Earth keeps on giving.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.120
Pacha Mama Sige Dando.
