00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
You've known it when before everything was knocked down, Loudon Square and all of that,

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.840
and now what did it feel like? They knocked it down?

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.040
Oh, well, you know what? Did you know the... Oh, what was he?

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.640
Dunleavy his name was. I think he was a councillor or something.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.040
You know, if he was down in his poppins for my mother's and they'd say they were sorry after.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.320
You know, they pulled them all down. They were sorry.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.920
There were some wonderful houses. Loudon Square was glorious.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.560
Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, my father used to say all the captains and when he came here,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.760
there was all captains in that living in Loudon Square, you know, from the seaman.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.640
The key people, the captains of Seaman.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.880
And he said he held his steps going up to the houses before they pulled them all down.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.560
With your extended family, all of the sports stars.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.400
I mean, you know, it seems like every single one of them was a sports star.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.720
That's it. That's it. But of course, I mean, we're the pride of this.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.480
They couldn't play for Wales.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.000
No.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.080
None of them. I bet they were sorry after.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.920
Well, yeah, you had talent like Johnny, who went north.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.280
You know.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.680
Yeah, you often look up my brother. He was good.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.320
Yeah. He was good.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.920
They said, because when he passed, a lot of them come down from Yorkshire.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.640
I mean, none of them was given a eulogy, you know, in the church.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.640
And he said, no one has passed him yet, the gold.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.160
Johnny.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.600
Yeah.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.840
And they loved Billy Boston and Barry Wiggins.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.840
Yeah. I mean, it's crazy.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.200
They adore him up north and Cardiff don't even honour him.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.880
No.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.000
And there can only be a couple of reasons for that.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.800
Of course.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.720
Of course.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.880
Yeah.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.600
So what about you and family? You said you had your boy Craig.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.680
Yes.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.400
So what about your family?

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.680
Craig passed away.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.520
Right.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.240
He was only 40.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.400
I'm sorry to hear that, love. I didn't know.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.400
Yeah.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.120
Oh, everybody loved Craig.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.920
Yeah.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:52.800
He, you know, he had a good education, but he wanted to be in the airline.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.240
You know.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.520
He wanted to be in the airline.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.480
And then he went in the airline after.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.920
Yeah, and he liked it.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.600
Right.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.880
And everybody loved Craig.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.240
Yeah.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.920
Oh dear.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.800
Yeah.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.240
Yeah.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.640
He's a.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.040
There are sad times and there are good times.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.080
Oh, yes.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.640
Yes.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.560
And Laura's my friend.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.720
She said she was talking to you, wasn't she?

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.120
Yeah.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.280
Yeah, I talked to her.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.000
Was it yesterday?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.200
Yesterday, I think it was.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.440
Oh, yes.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.800
Yeah, yesterday morning I talked to Laura.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.360
But you were talking before that.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.080
Only to arrange a time.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.480
Oh, I see.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.960
Yeah.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.480
Because I went to Laura's wedding.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.760
I was 14.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.600
Yeah.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.080
I was 14 when Laura got married.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.840
I went to her wedding.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.720
Yeah.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.760
Oh dear.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.600
Yeah.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.040
But it's.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.400
Laura's a good mate, yeah.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.720
But so much has changed, doesn't it, kid?

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:14.360
I mean, in terms of what kids now have compared to what we might remember.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.000
You know, our rule.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.800
The things we could do, the things we were able to do.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.880
You know, go out on the beginning of the day if it wasn't a school day.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.520
And off you went all day.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.360
Yeah.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.120
I mean, I was talking to Eleanor.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.840
And I was saying, when we went to school, you have to go.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.000
You have to go in the snow.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.240
None of them closed.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.680
The schools didn't close like they do now.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.960
Anything happened, the schools closed.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.920
That one like that.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.120
We used to come home, oh my god.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.960
In all kinds of winds and weathers.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.600
But now today, they closed it.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.880
I could have snowed.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.400
We used to go in the sky.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.320
They never closed.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.400
They closed.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.800
That just meant playtime was more fun.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.000
Yeah.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.920
And then you'd come in crying.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.760
Soaking wet.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.680
Snowballs.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.000
I know you're going to come in crying.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.560
Yeah.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.760
And even if you were the one who threw the first one.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.720
Yes.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.280
Did Laura tell us you worked in the colonial center?

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.480
Yeah, yeah, she did.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.960
She did.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.280
We were good kids.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.640
I said, we never had a lot, but we were happy.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.720
My mother always said that.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.680
And then they used to say, oh, ma'am.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.520
So and so and so and so.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.880
They had bikes for Christmas.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.760
And they sat near there.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.360
Mama's slapping hands on the table.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.760
She said, it's your bike.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.160
Those people are going to eat.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.920
She always threw that.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.240
Mind you, oh, god.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.120
We had a good upbringing.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.280
There was five of us.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.600
And then my father went to see it.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.160
And then my mother used to take us all to the shelters.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.720
In the night, you know, the head-in shelters.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.960
Because you remember the Second World War.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.600
You were younger.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.880
Oh, yeah.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.080
I was only 17.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.960
I was seven.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.040
When the war started, yeah.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.160
What do you remember of it, Cain?

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.640
Everything.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.000
The bombing and all things.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.280
You know, we'd be in the shelter.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.040
We knew we were going to eat, you know what I mean?

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.680
In the night.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.800
And it was on Butte Road, all the shelters.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.240
And then this, because Mama had five of us.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.120
And I was just little.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.920
And my mother had it on the lap.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.200
The tears was running from my mother's eyes.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.720
Aunt Juarez.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.800
She was a bigot, that one.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.560
I said, oh, Mama, I'll throw this water running on me.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.480
Mama said she was thinking about, oh, what am I

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.160
going to do with all these bombs?

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.880
You know what I mean?

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.920
What am I going to do to my kids?

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.320
She said that.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.720
And that's how I remember then.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.920
And the woman next to my mother said,

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.400
oh, that's a ticket I'd love.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.960
My mother said, oh, I don't smoke.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.240
I said, let's smoke.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.240
Oh, I'll throw it to you.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.000
It'll calm your nerves.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.320
So the next night, my mother said,

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.240
oh, I'll buy a packet of cigarettes.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.160
I'll take the woman, you know, and I'm back.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.720
You boy didn't want me back.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.360
I'm also sorry my mother's smoking.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.840
I think he hates him.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.320
I think he hates him.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.560
People used to think it was good for them.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:59.200
But then when he was 80, the doctor said,

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.320
keep going through it.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.520
I forgot what that doctor was there.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.080
You know, because I've had chest and I've lunged

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:05.960
and I've had.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.840
And he said, oh, Mrs. Freeman, you've got to.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.000
You've got to stop smoking.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.800
So she said, oh, yes, I will.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.200
He said, you said that last time.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.440
And anyway, she stopped.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.160
She was 80.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.000
And he said, oh, your chest and this and that.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.880
Well, my mother didn't do bad.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.600
She didn't pass as a 94.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.160
But that was good going, wasn't it?

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.520
Yeah.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.400
Yeah.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.040
And she finished smoking when she was 80.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.440
And then my father and me, dad used to go upstairs and smoke.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.120
And I used to go in the kitchen.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.920
And she'd say, look, I'm not spoiling your enjoyment

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.760
because I finished.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.400
You know what?

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.560
After she finished smoking for a while, she said,

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.960
after the meal, she said, put it in the ashtray.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.000
Oh, it's a laugh.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.400
You see?

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:07.720
But once the ashtray is happy, it's a habit, she said.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.480
Well, it kept going on and on and on for my mother.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.200
Because you could smoke on the buses then.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.560
And then we'd have the skinheads go to Langdonk on the bus.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.880
You know, at the back.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.280
And we'd have the skinheads going to Langdonk.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.040
And she was 80 then.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.240
And we got there and we said, oh.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.480
And that was the last skinhead she had.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.600
That was good going.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.560
Just stopped just like that.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.960
Yeah, but strong women.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.440
Strong women.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.800
Yeah.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:47.040
I mean, my nan always used to say, the men can think,

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.480
but the women run the community.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.680
That's it.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:55.800
We just let the men pretend, she used to say.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.080
Yeah.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:57.960
Still true.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.560
Still true.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.520
That's it.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.920
What about the way, one of the things a lot of people

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.960
have talked about is manners and the way people have always

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.120
respected older people, auntie and uncle.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.960
Oh, yeah.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.680
Oh, yeah.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.840
Because a girl says we run, in my convenience again,

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.640
I wanted a job there.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:26.360
She says, we call you, you got some auntie, haven't you?

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.720
I said, no.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.200
I said, we knew her good.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.400
And we didn't need to call her by her name.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.320
And so we used to call her auntie.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:35.840
Yeah.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.280
So I said, oh, and she next to myself, gosh,

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.040
you got some auntie.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.960
But I did that so we was, you know.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.400
Yeah, it's respect, you know.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.840
As a child, you couldn't call them by their first name.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.240
No, no, no, no.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.600
No.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:02.240
Yeah, but as I said, nobody had loads of money or nothing

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.480
like that.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.360
You know what I mean?

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.680
But you still have the good life.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.200
Yeah.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.160
When we were kids, yeah, my father went to sea.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:16.720
And I always remember, Bill and Keith,

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.360
a fellow that was in charge, one of them, with the ships

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.000
and all, because he used to come up,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.880
and he'd say, oh, John, this fellow can't go.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.480
He said, would you take his place?

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.320
So dad said, well, I'm going to love it time.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.040
And he said, we'll catch the train and so on.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.600
So anyway, dad, I missed the train.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.920
And he came back, and he got in touch with Bill.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.040
And he said, I missed the train.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.760
He said, I won't make it.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.160
So it's a good job.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:50.360
He never think of throwing that ship he would have been on.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.320
Yeah.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:57.280
That's just the way your luck runs sometimes, isn't it?

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.640
Yeah, he missed the train.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.880
And then I said, oh, I'm telling him,

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.040
my I'm not catching the next one.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.360
He couldn't have done it anyway.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.600
He couldn't have gone.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.320
He missed the boat.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.560
And yeah, it blew up.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:20.160
He said, we should be coming down

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.640
wherever the river was, the Pacific or the Atlantic or what.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:29.240
And bombs would be, he said, they'd be shipped on fire

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.600
each side of him, you know, and they'd be going through.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.920
Oh, God, he said it was terrible.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.200
Because I know a lot of my friends off their father's.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.520
Well, Laura was saying about her brother and.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.280
Yeah, yeah.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.280
Because my my granddad, he was from Barbados and he went.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.400
He was on the ships all the way through the First World War.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.320
He then he then became a miner

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.520
at just the beginning of the Second World War,

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.240
because my nan said, you are not going again.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.360
Because you went, you live through one.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.200
You'll never live through another.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.000
She wouldn't let him go.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.080
And it's typical, it's typical luck.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.960
You know, you can't be a merchant seamen, which is hard enough life.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.480
So what do you do? You become a miner.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:24.080
Yeah, it gets you good enough, because in the world we.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.880
Went to Aberadwe, number day.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.040
Yeah.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:33.120
And. Oh, God, I went to my mother and I came back.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.000
A lot of us went.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.960
I mean, it was you got more prejudice going into Cardiff

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.040
and once you were at the bay.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.560
And I didn't know what to do, Laura, what I was when we were kids.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:52.160
You know, because everybody's grandmother was white.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.280
It's what I mean.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.000
And everything mixed.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.840
Oh, yeah, you didn't know until you went out to the,

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.400
you know, to the bay.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.880
Yeah.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:12.000
I mean, without the bay, without the bay, Cardiff.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.160
I always say without the bay, Cardiff would have had no money.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:22.760
Because it was the work of all of those seamen and their families

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.880
that made Cardiff rich.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.640
Yes.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.120
And yet they still look down on people.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.400
Oh, yeah.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.640
But of course, you didn't know until you went out to the bay.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.560
You know.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.440
I mean, I think I think that's why they knocked down all the houses.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.920
Because it was like, oh, no, we don't want to.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.160
We, you know, we're now we're now no longer need them kind of thing.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.440
You know. Yeah.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:56.360
But as the lazy said, yeah, the council, they could have done that.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.400
Yeah. And that'd be worth money.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.240
They were better.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.080
They were better looking at some of the flats.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.720
He said they were sorry.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.360
Yeah. Desperately.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.160
But they didn't do a map because they did them in other places.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.840
Because I know I worked with this woman and

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:20.600
I say, oh, pretend I'm one of those places.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:26.400
And she said they put a caravan in the yard.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.080
Oh, they got it there. I don't know.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.760
And they lived in there until they got their house.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.080
Right.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.280
Yeah, they could have done that.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.000
You know, we're on the street.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.880
Instead, you know, they knocked down they knocked down half of Butown and the bay.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:46.240
And then they and at the same time, they knocked down Thompson Street and all of the docks around Barry.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.840
In Barry. Yeah.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.840
Just.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.920
So, yeah, but yeah, but but that's that's the thing, isn't there?

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:04.440
It's like you and me having a conversation and immediately there's someone who crossovers our lives.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.640
That's it.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:09.880
You know, and that's that's something that's missing nowadays.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:16.000
That, you know, if you you talk to anybody from the bay, you talk to anybody who's from from Barry,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.800
particularly the merchant Siemens families and their lives will overlap.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.520
You know, you know somebody or when I was a kid,

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:32.360
I used to go out with the boys from the bay all the time and and they'd come over the island and and.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.360
Yeah.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.080
Yeah.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.080
Yeah.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.080
They were good people.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.080
Yeah.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.080
Yeah, they were good.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.160
They were good people and they were good days.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.280
And that's all you could wish for, isn't it?

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.280
Really?

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.280
I know.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:56.440
And when you're a kid, you don't understand how some kids got this or that, you know.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.600
But oh, we had a good life.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.160
Oh, God, they were fine of us.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.760
And we had a good, good upbringing.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.360
You said you couldn't talk, but you did.

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.360
Ha ha.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.360
Ha ha ha ha.

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:16.840
Oh, crazy.

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:17.840
Yeah.

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.560
I bet you just caught me because I came in.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.000
You didn't call this morning, did you?

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.680
No, no, no, no, no.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.160
Somebody called when it was.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.680
Someone has just passed away.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.960
So maybe that was it.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.480
Michael Michael dos Santos.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.320
It is right then, isn't it?

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.760
Because I hear that this morning.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.760
Yeah, I think he passed away.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.760
It is right.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.760
Yeah, he passed away.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.560
Yeah, because somebody called me this morning.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.480
So they said, go meet people there.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.880
Just in case, you know.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.160
Yeah, and that's what it that's what it was.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.360
Oh, God.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.360
Yeah.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:56.080
The trouble at the moment as well is, although we can clap from the side of the road, we

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
can't have proper funerals.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
No, no.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.520
And one thing the Bay does and Bute Town does is proper funerals.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.520
Oh my God, yes.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:18.320
Because when my brother died and the kids were living in Holmen, he came back and people

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.880
come down from Yorkshire, you know, to the funeral.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.280
And they said, we've never seen anything like it.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.280
You know, because we went to the club.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:34.280
Yeah, you know, we put on the, you know, the food and everything.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.280
Oh my God.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.280
People walking behind, you know, it's.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.280
Yes.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:47.280
But of course, that's the last time I've seen them.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.280
Michael.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.280
Yeah.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.680
Yeah.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:59.680
And I thought I laughed with him because he used to shave his head, you know, bald.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.680
Yeah.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:07.680
And his sister lived in Oddsworth Square and you had to go all the way up those steps,

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.680
you know.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:14.680
So he came in and was in the shop and we were having a laugh and talking and he said, Oh

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:18.680
God, when he said those stairs, he said, when I came, he said, when I went to my sister's

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:24.080
because he said I come out of the shop, he said I had hair when I went in.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.080
He was just bald.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:32.080
He said it was a right moment, he said, I had hair when I came in.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.080
And one of you that this morning, you have.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.080
Yeah.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:42.080
And my friends, they don't see nothing because they don't know if it's right or not.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:45.080
You know, because you use these rumors, you know.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.080
Yeah.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:52.480
Yeah, somebody else called me when I was filming the doc, doing the shopping.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:58.480
But the thing is, the thing is, I always say the only memory you should have of people,

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.480
you know, it's those good moments.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.480
Yeah.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.480
You know, and I think that's why we celebrate a funeral.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:12.480
Yeah, you should actually, you don't mourn their passing because we're all going to pass.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:13.480
Yeah, of course.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.880
And all you want is people to celebrate and remember the good times.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.880
Right, I've taken up loads and loads of your time and I'm grateful for it.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.880
I know, I've just been saying thanks for the cup of tea.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.880
Well, it's a bad time, you had one.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.880
And if you were a decent person, you'd have made me one by now.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.880
But anyway.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.880
Right, I'm going to go.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.880
Thank you, Bill.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.880
I'm really, really grateful, kid.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.280
Get yourself a cup of tea.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.280
Or better still, have a cup of coffee with some honey in.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.280
Oh yeah, that's me.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.280
I love my honey.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.280
Yeah.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.280
I eat honey when it's coming out of my mouth.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:01.280
I'll tell you what, every morning, every morning, I have Weetabix or shredded wheat, right?

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.280
Yeah, I got a lighter.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.280
And I put honey on it.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.280
Oh, I love honey.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.280
Oh, it's just.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.280
Are you having a coffee?

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.280
Oh, yeah, I have.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:12.680
You have honey in your coffee?

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.680
Yeah.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:19.680
The doctor said to me, you're having too much sugar.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.680
You shouldn't have sugar.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.680
I said, OK.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.680
So I put honey on things.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:29.680
Yeah, that's why I never had, it's funny, from a kid, never had sugar in my tea.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.680
Never had sugar in my tea, ever.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.680
From a kiddie.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.680
Yeah, because I didn't like it.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.680
Yeah, they always had no sugar.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:43.080
But loving people now don't like sugar in their tea, do they?

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.080
Yeah, but they have those sweetener things.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.080
I'd rather have a spoonful of honey, honestly.

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.080
Oh, no.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.080
I'd rather have a spoonful of honey.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.080
I could taste sweetener.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.080
I don't like it.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.080
No.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.080
In my coffee, I have honey.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.080
Yeah.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.080
And before I go bed, I always make a hot chocolate.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.080
And I have honey in a drop of brandy.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:09.080
I'll tell you what I've done for you today.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:13.480
You're in lockdown and I've taken your mind back.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.480
And you'll be thinking about that for the rest of tonight.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.480
And other stuff will appear in your head.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.480
And I'll tell you, you think of your mum and you'll start to smile.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.480
And here you are again, you're doing it.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.480
I'm never going to get a cup of tea here, Beryl.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.480
Let me tell you, when we were kids,

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.880
I mean there was no televisions and all that then.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.880
And we'd all be on the fire in the kitchen

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.880
and listening to the radio,

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.880
the stories on the radio.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.880
Oh, it would be wonderful.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.880
We didn't know nothing about televisions and all that.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.880
When I was a kiddie.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:57.880
Yeah.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.880
I can remember when the first kid in our street in London,

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.880
we were the second family.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.880
I've no idea where the telly was.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.880
We were the second family.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.880
I've no idea where the telly came from, so we won't go into that.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.880
But we were the second family that had a telly in our street.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.880
And when someone got a telly,

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:19.880
I'll tell you what, they regretted it because their house was never empty.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:20.880
I know.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.880
Well, we were like that.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.880
Because there was only two families that had a telly.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.880
There was our family, another family up the street.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.880
And then my sister and her husband bought it for my mother.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.880
There was only a little screen, black and white.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:41.880
And this lady up the street used to come in.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.880
And another one on the other side of the road.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.880
You couldn't sit in your friend's room.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.880
There was people in there.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:56.880
I mean, my mum used to make a huge pot of spaghetti bolognese

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.880
on FA Cup final day.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:05.880
Literally a huge pot because we had the telly.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:10.880
And I'd be there with a group of my friends.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.880
My brother Paul, who's three years older than me,

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.880
would be there with a group of his friends.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.880
Doors open, I'm cooking, come in.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.880
And that's the way it is.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.880
And people don't get, that's the way it was in Barry.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.880
That's the way it was in the bay in Bute Town.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.880
Of course it was.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.880
I remember going to dinner with somebody.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.880
Because you never know.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.880
What goes around comes around.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:40.880
There's times when we didn't have anything on the table.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.880
And someone else did.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.880
And so you help someone, they help you.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.880
And no one was embarrassed because someone had to ask.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.880
That's the other thing I thought was good.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.880
You didn't have to go any chance.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.880
You best come and have some of the week, kid.

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:02.880
Because everybody knew I had no money.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.880
Yes.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.880
It's special.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.880
It's a Christ card.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.880
Yeah, but I'm ready now for my teeth.

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.880
You're going to blame me now.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.880
That's not going to work.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.880
I'm going to go.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.880
Listen.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.880
I'm going because you're never going to let me get off the phone.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.880
I'm ready for it all.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.880
I'm going before you.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.880
I've got my tooth stuck in this cat.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.880
I'll see you after lockdown, Beryl.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.880
Okay, love.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.880
Bye, love.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.880
Take care.
