00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
you know, you weren't allowed to sort of diagnose

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.800
or any sort of abnormalities or anything.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.300
You could spot them and then refer it,

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.040
but so it's advanced quite a bit.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.500
But I did enjoy that side of it.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.500
You know, I felt that I got on well with my patients.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.500
In particular, I used to see a lot of children.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.500
So I did have a successful career.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.500
Early on I was made president of the South Wales Amman Optical Association.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.500
And I was quite involved outside of the everyday

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.500
sort of working as an optician as well.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.500
I did quite early on have a back problem.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.500
I slipped and had a back problem.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.500
And I was told then that my back was not working.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:23.500
That my sort of career as an optician could well, you know, come to an end quite early.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.500
So I did do a sort of secondary career alongside that

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:38.500
in that I used to refurbish old properties.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.500
And it really started with I had a practice in Cobridge Road

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.500
where I used just the ground floor of this house.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.500
And I converted the upper floor into a flat.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.500
Well, they call them apartments now, but it...

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.500
And I really enjoyed doing the drawings and working out the costs and doing the whole of that.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.500
So I went on to do other schemes of that nature alongside my optical business.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:22.500
And I know it sounds a bit showy-offy, but I actually won a Prince of Wales Award for one of my schemes.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:31.500
And we were lucky enough to go to the Palace and do a presentation in front of Prince Charles.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.500
Would you like to say a bit more about that? What kind of scheme it was and what it meant to you?

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.500
Yeah, it was a derelict building in Caerphilly,

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:52.500
which I converted into units which created a lot of employment.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:04.500
And, you know, it got quite a reception from the Civic Trust and things of that nature as well

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.500
because it was right in the centre of Caerphilly.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:21.500
So it not only got rid of an eyesore, but created employment for about 25, 30 people.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:29.500
But it's a bit scary giving a presentation to Prince Charles, but it's quite amazing how knowledgeable he is

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:42.500
and how well he'd been sort of shown about the project. He knew everything about it.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.500
He'd been briefed about it.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.500
Very well briefed, yeah.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.500
Where did you have to do this presentation then?

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.500
In St James's Palace.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.500
OK, thank you.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.500
Can we go back to being president of the South Wales and Morne Optical System?

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.500
Can you tell me that's an honorary position?

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.500
Yes.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.500
What would that involve?
