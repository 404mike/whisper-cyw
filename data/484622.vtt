Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.680
Interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.920
The venue is the Swicker office.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.080
The date is the 20th of October 2014.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.320
And the interviewee is Rob Smith.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.120
Rob could you spell your name in full for us for the record?

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.240
R-O-B-E-R-T-S-M-I-T-H.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.920
Thanks very much.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.640
Rob amongst your many attributes, you are musical director and founder of Wunderbras.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.440
Could you tell us a little bit about the origins of Wunderbras?

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:49.840
Yeah around the mid 80s there was a workshop project run by the Welsh Jazz Society.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.040
And I was playing a lot with actually when it started when the Four Bars Inn opened,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.120
which is where it was based.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.320
Now Dempsey's.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.400
When that opened I was actually working with the dance company away in Ireland for a while.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.600
So when we came back we kind of missed out on this place.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.360
Opening up.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.160
Yeah.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.560
You need a lower recording level Pumery.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.920
Where's your recording level bro?

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.440
Input level.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.440
So yeah that's better isn't it?

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.480
You can still hear me.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.280
Yeah.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.440
It's peaking around 12.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.160
Yeah minus 12 that's where I'd go.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:35.120
So yeah so suddenly this new venue had opened in Cardiff.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.000
This is going a bit a long way around the houses.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.840
But myself and Jess Phillips who I was working with a lot at that time,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.640
we just started going along to the workshop band and they went through a lot of tutors really quickly.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.360
And at some point after a couple of years or a year and a half or something they said well why don't you run it.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.200
So we decided to run it.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:05.440
And we changed the way it worked really instead of just being a load of people turning up and playing solos in a set order.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.360
We tried to build it into a functioning band almost like a little big band.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.480
And we were ticking over with this quite nicely doing the odd performance in the four bars.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.520
And then the carnival started up.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.280
Mass carnival started up with Swicker in 1990.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.520
And you wanted street music.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.280
So basically we said well we've got all these musicians.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.880
Let's use this workshop band to create the street music.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.320
So the first one was in 1990.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.520
I'd already worked with you on running some community music.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.480
Well it was a kind of community music orchestra for the final Taliesin project.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.320
I believe it was the final Taliesin project which was Mad Dog.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.680
So we put together a little community band for that which was nothing really to do with the jazz society.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:05.120
It was completely set up by Swicker and it was bringing people in who were interested in community music I suppose and getting involved.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.480
But in a fairly non-specialised way.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.040
Just waiting for that peak to disappear.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:23.440
So we did that and we brought these two things together to create a street band for the first mass carnival.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.640
I think I wrote some music especially for it.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.760
I think I remember the...

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.600
It was very much based on Soka music that first one.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.920
So I worked out some original pieces and we took part in the parade.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.960
And that gave a new dimension to the workshop band really because it meant that we could...

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.520
We didn't only have to play jazz, we could play street music and I personally was very excited by this.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:03.920
Wind forward a couple of years later I'm training to be a community musician with Community Music Wales and I have to start up a project.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.440
For my final project as part of that.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.640
I mean if it was run now it would be a masters.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.640
It was a really involved year long course.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.560
It was way more than people have to do for a masters now but for some reason it wasn't.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.200
So it was just a certificate in community music training.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.440
But the final project you had to start up something and run it and evaluate it.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.000
And I noticed that a lot of people we were working with, the musicians, what they wanted to do, they wanted to show off.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.760
They wanted to play really long solos over jazz standards.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:45.200
Whereas me and Jess were more into building something communally and getting people to be more creatively involved.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.680
We were also into street music.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.600
I'd been to New Orleans in 1991.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.120
I think for the 1991 mass we brought Claude down to beef up the street band.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.120
Because he worked with the Grand Union and he'd done loads of street music.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.080
He knows a hell of a lot about that kind of music.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.360
So we brought Claude Depper down in 1991.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:19.120
And in that year I also got to go to New Orleans, total coincidence, and saw how street music could work in that context.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:26.160
So I was really, I think at that period, the early 90s, I got a real appetite for street music.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.920
Street brass music let's call it.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:37.280
Because I thought it was something that was, I thought it was kind of, nobody was really doing it around here.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:44.240
A couple of bands doing it, the sort of politically motivated bands like the Fallout band and things like that.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.320
But I felt there was a way of doing it a lot better.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.920
So anyway, the final project came up.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.200
I thought all these guys, they don't really want to be in a street band.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.960
So I'm going to start up a street band.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:04.720
So the garden festival, Ebbw Vale Garden Festival in 1992, they gave us the seed funding of 500 quid to start something up in the valleys.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.400
We found a very dynamic person called Denise Lord.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:18.880
And she put together a band for a theatre project about, I think, the year before, Valley of the Kings, I think it was called.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.360
And she was keen to try and get something going.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.440
So we teamed up with her and we got and we started this little workshop in the valleys in Pontepri.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.360
In the Muni Arts Centre, actually, the first sessions were.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.160
And the first session, no, no, it was at Club of Bond, actually.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.320
But the first session, nobody turned up.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.920
And she said, don't miss out next week.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.120
Come in fortnight time and I'll get in touch with all the contacts that I made for Valley of the Kings.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.120
And I'll make sure that there are people here.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.240
And so we said, OK.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:59.360
And we we we trust we didn't have any option but to trust that she knew what she was doing.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.560
So we turned up two weeks later and there were about 10 people there.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:08.640
And we thought, well, we've got a project, you know, it'll run it for 10 weeks and they'll see out.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:18.080
But after that 10 weeks, we performed a bit at the garden festival and a couple of selected venues in the valleys, really choice venues like the Gunnar's Estate.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:29.280
Parading around the Gunnar's Estate where people just came out of their houses and stared at you as if you just beamed down from Mars or something.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:37.120
And and then people who were in it were really didn't want to stop after 10 weeks.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.800
So then they they got together and formed a committee and applied for the money to keep it going.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.760
And they got that money and it's still going.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:52.400
It's still going and it continues to go from strength to strength up and down, but from strength to strength.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.280
Really, that's basically it.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.600
But and that's a long winded story.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:09.600
But that is it basically there is this tension with working with jazz musicians and doing street music is that a lot of jazz musicians, they just want to be in a club and playing.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.880
They've got this image of what jazz is about, and it doesn't involve going out on the streets.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.480
If it does, it's in a warm climate.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:23.280
And it's but there are some of us in the band who are really enthusiastic about street music.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:28.560
And it's the enthusiasm of that fear that call that's kept the street side of Wanderbass going.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:42.000
And you've performed and led street bands in an extraordinary number of card carpools with quickly totting them up.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.680
And you come to the grand total of 20 out of 25, which makes you a carpool hero.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.160
Well, I've taken I've ticked the ones I'm pretty sure we did.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.360
And I think I think it's 20.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.480
I think it's about 20.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.520
I can well believe that.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:06.640
Obviously, your forte is music and the music is vitally important for giving the energy for groups to dance to.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:24.000
But in terms of costume and the various costumes that have been made for and provided for you and for Wanderbass, are there any good, bad or not or good, bad or ugly that stick in your mind, stuff that worked or stuff that malfunctioned?

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.240
Well, there was one there was one we we once did a carnival.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.760
This must have been around the time that we started.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.880
What Wanderbass can't have been very going for very long at this point.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:42.400
But we did we did a little section of of mass with chapter for children.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:50.080
And we had these guys who were basically students looking for a summer work placement.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.680
They were our students and they made these beautiful costumes.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.120
But they weren't used to mass, so they just made one off costumes.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.480
And so the costumes were beautiful and the kids helped to design them.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:09.920
And the thing looked amazing, but they weren't really, you know, until you've actually walked a costume, you probably don't know much about comfort and things like that.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.920
And they came up with this amazing costume.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.040
The fruit was the theme and this amazing orange costume.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.640
There's nobody to walk it.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.280
So I just said, all right, well, I'm not it's not staying in the box.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.080
I'm going to walk it.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:27.680
So I I decided I was going to play and there's still photos of me wearing this looking like Sun Ra or something.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.920
It's a beautiful costume, but it's bizarre.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:35.520
Bright orange, bright orange, sparkly stuff all over it and extensions and things like that.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:48.800
The problem with it was that it had a it had a sort of with the frame over the head and and he had this big hat on.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:54.480
And whenever the wind blew, it it blew up and it pushed my chin like that.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:00.160
So it caught me under the chin and pushed my chin up, which when you're playing the soprano sax is really uncomfortable.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.880
So I ended up like with cuts all over my chin and everything at the end of that parade.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.840
So that one left a mental scar.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:18.720
And I and I can't some of the yes, basically the ones that really stick in your mind are the ones that they either they haven't really thought it through.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:25.440
Or they they've thought it through, but they have forgot to think about the practicalities of playing an instrument.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:36.560
So the best things are just to stick a bit of a hat on us and drape something over us and leave us in fairly comfortable clothing because they really I mean, a lot of the guys who design the costumes.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:45.280
I mean, it's better now because obviously they've done it a few times, but they used to they forgot how hard we were working just to play the instrument sometimes.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:51.040
And to give us extra things to do and the extra things to think about, it doesn't really work for musicians.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:57.840
So I'm in on a lot of ones where bits of costume have been discarded as part of the parade.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.840
But that one stuck in the mind.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:06.320
It's interesting you mentioned stamina and exhaustion and well, you didn't mention exhaustion, but I just have.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.800
And of course, an average

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.920
kind of carnival, kind of mass carnival parade would be an hour to 90 minutes.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:24.320
What's that like trying to keep the energy up or even just the physicality of your lungs must be the size of God knows what I mean.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:33.920
Well, you have to pace yourself and you know, you you think, right, we're going to have we're going to be going down St Mary Street.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:42.400
And if the if it's gone well, if it's a nice day, you know, you're going to get a big crowd in St Mary Street and probably going to get to stop in St Mary Street as well.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:47.120
And so you you kind of save your best material and a bit of energy for that.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.360
But basically you either you either like it or you don't.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:57.600
And there's a people in Wunderbras who they they want to be in the band in order to be in the band.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.600
You have to do parades.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.480
So they put up with having to do parades.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:15.040
And there are some in the band and all the leaders of the band, this includes who actually love doing parades because we've got this image of this romantic image of New Orleans parades and things like that.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.040
And we'd all love to be in the New Orleans parade.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:21.360
So we're trying to do that thing in Cardiff and we really believe in it.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:32.400
And if you actually sign up for it and get into it and and because we worked really hard on making this street music work without trying to copy the New Orleans.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:39.440
So we've drafted in arrangements from popular music that people in the crowd will recognise.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.320
You know, because in New Orleans, they know all the traditional material.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.520
So they play Saint and everybody loves it.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:50.640
Whereas we'll play Kanye West and you get sort of, oh, but is that really what they're playing?

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.760
Are they really playing that?

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.920
So we get that kind of recognition factor.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.840
But some of us really love it.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.960
And and you don't really if you if you're actually committed to it and a couple of hours of really hard work.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:07.520
You know, you bring a hip flask for a bit of energy replacement.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:14.880
But if you if you really love it, then you don't think about what it's physically costing you until afterwards.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.520
The next day, you're absolutely shattered.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:25.600
But, you know, there are people who are never going to get that into it and they're doing it as a kind of suffer under sufferance.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.640
And then there are people who just are totally into it and love it.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.200
And if the weather's bad, it's harder to enjoy it.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.080
It has to be said.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:38.240
But if the weather's nice and the crowd are nice and and people are helping you,

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.400
because sometimes people really help you on the parade.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.120
There was one.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.280
There was one year, I remember I could see the woman there.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.200
She's got that blue headdress on.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:49.840
What's her name?

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.480
Atiola.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.360
Atiola.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:58.160
She was she was kind of with the band and she was she was being sort of I don't know.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.360
But she was dancing around the band and she had so much energy and she was so good.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.720
And she knew what carnival was about.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.560
You could tell the way she interacted with people.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.680
She was some kind of spirit.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:17.120
And that made the band really got behind her and really performed that because she she kind of they followed her cue.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.920
She was totally into it and she's an amazing performer.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.840
She looks amazing.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.360
The costume that she was wearing was amazing and the band just completely got into it.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.280
She was dancing all around us and everything.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.360
She just didn't stop for two hours.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.560
And that was fantastic.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:36.640
So when you when you've got people who really kind of they're almost like guiding spirits who get you through it.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.000
When you've got people in in the carnival crew who will do that,

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:45.280
then that's great because then you feel like you're really part of something really big then.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:51.520
And and then somewhere at the back of mind, the mind you're actually thinking,

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.360
well, when if it's Mardi Gras,

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.480
they'll start doing this around 11 in the morning

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.560
and they'll still be doing it at 11 at night.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:04.000
So two hours is not two hours is not that bad, really.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.480
I mean, they probably sound really ropey after 12 hours doing it.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.440
But, you know, two hours isn't that bad, really.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.160
We're wusses.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:21.760
Clark Carnival has proved to be weatherproof in the sense that even when the weather is atrocious

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:30.720
and I'll refer to the three years in a row that 2005, six and seven were from setting up

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:36.320
the entire parade and the rest of it, we had, I mean, atrocious weather really, you know,

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.080
our audience had to be completely weatherproofed.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.680
And that's mad.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:49.360
What are the difficulties involved in actually playing brass in a consistent torrent?

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.720
Well, it's pretty it's pretty much impossible.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.440
We have done it.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:59.120
We have done things where we've been waiting to go on the parade and it just

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:04.320
absolutely the heavens have opened and we've just taken it on the chin and just gone with it.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.120
Really, the rain does brass instruments do not like the rain.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.240
The worst thing is saxes and flutes and wind and things like that,

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.720
because the mechanisms are very difficult and it actually rusts the mechanism.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.720
So you can actually wreck an instrument if you, you know, if water gets in there.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:29.600
The other brass, trumpets and trombones, tubas, things like that, they're not so vulnerable

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:34.480
because they don't have the delicate machinery, bit of oil all sorted out.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.760
And they don't have the, you know, because so that's it really.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.640
And you always leave it up to the players.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:48.480
If a player is so worried about their instrument that they feel that they're going to

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:53.520
have to have thousands of pounds of work done on it, then they just leave.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.480
They just don't do it.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.600
And I don't make them do it.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.320
It's up to them.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.560
I don't try and make them do it.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.360
I say if you're, you know, if you're concerned about your instrument, just,

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.440
but a lot of people have got kind of will borrow,

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:08.640
will have a cheap old student instrument that they'll bring along to parades.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.400
If they think it's going to rain, things like that.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.640
People generally tend to get into it, but it is really tricky.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:19.280
It's the same for everybody else is that your fingers are slippy on the instrument and you,

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.720
it means you can't play the notes.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.800
You intend to play a note and you don't get the right note.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.520
You, you also, the wind in your, the rain in your eyes is a problem.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.120
It's best if you've got some kind of head gear that keeps the rain out of your eyes

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.480
because that can be really horrible.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:40.560
Apart from that, same for everybody else, really same, same as it is for everybody else.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.560
It's horrible when it's raining and it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:50.640
that's one reason why street street art hasn't really taken off in this country.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:51.360
It's the weather.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.600
Yeah. I mean, whether it's fairly predictable in, in other places.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:02.240
Obviously this project, the anniversary project deals primarily with Cardiff carnival,

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.360
but as you, as you said in the opening remarks, you and I have

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.880
worked on projects that predate Cardiff carnival and in Swicker,

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:17.760
we've worked on other projects, which I would say, share the same celebratory outlook,

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.400
but their format and presentation have been different.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.320
Which ones stick in your mind as we, as we look back at our history?

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:32.720
Well, we, before, before anybody has, any of us had got into our steady arts work,

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.680
if there's such a thing exists, exists.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:41.360
We, we did the carnival, we did the fundraiser for the miners together.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:45.840
And that was a memorable experience just because we were taking a hell of a risk, just

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:49.920
wandering into pubs and playing Christmas carols and collecting music.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.080
But I think that was just making a big impact and then going as quickly as possible.

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.320
And it was, it was for a purpose.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:01.520
I, we were raising specifically, I tried to play the old heartstrings.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:06.320
It was specifically for presence for the striking miners children,

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.360
which you just thought most people couldn't get too annoyed about.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.320
Well, most people didn't.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.440
Most people were really nice.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.960
There were a few exceptions, but they were, most people were really nice about it and

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.560
we were right behind it.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.920
And, you know, and that's how I remember.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:20.480
Yeah, we were.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.520
Skinheads in the floor.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:26.080
But there were a couple of, there were two pubs, I remember, where we were set upon in,

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:30.960
in to vary it, where for various reasons, one because political objections and one

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:37.120
because you shouldn't go in that pub really at that time on Friday night.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.040
I believe you were groped in the spotlands.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.120
Yeah, I was groped in the spotlands.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:45.360
Which is a great title for an album, which is where you had to, to record it.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.520
But, and then the floor of, it was a well-known right wing pub where people weren't very

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:53.600
sympathetic to what we were trying to do and we were probably under a bit of physical danger

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.640
there, but we got away eventually.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.600
So there was that, yeah, making a big impact.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:04.800
And I think that sort of had a spirit of straight work about it, really, just going there,

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.240
making a big impact and get out.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.280
Yeah, guerrilla music.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:13.360
We also, I mean, as I said, there was the, the Madov project, which is where you pulled

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:19.200
me into the Taliesin fold and that is kind of what led to the straight art, the swicker

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.800
and the carnival arts.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:26.560
But the big things that we worked together on were in 1910, early 1910s, early 1910s,

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.440
1998, which was the bridge, a bont.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:37.840
And the thing that we did up in Tolvine, which was called Crossing Borders, Torifiniai, and

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.000
yeah, those were, those were a bit like oratorios.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.080
They were, yeah, so they were celebratory and they were very much creating a musical

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:52.880
structure that people could just get involved in and write from people who'd never played

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:53.680
samba.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.400
Kids in schools who'd never played samba getting good enough to go on stage and perform

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.960
samba in a very short period of time.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:07.120
To amateur choirs, to brass bands, to wonder brass were involved.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:14.080
We had a tabla group, we had a rapper, we had folk singer, gospel choir, things like

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:14.240
that.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.080
So it was just bringing together a lot of existing groups and trying to make something

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:22.160
interesting out of the combination and writing original music for them.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:28.640
That was the amazing thing because it just gave me a big canvas to work with and just,

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.640
you know, it's a bit daunting to write for 100 people and then to try and coordinate

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.640
a performance of 100 people.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:43.920
But it's that, you know, that big canvas is a really exciting project to be able to

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.920
work on really, to write for.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:50.240
The bridge in particular is a project I feel quite proud of and your role in that was,

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.000
you know, totally central in the rest of it.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:58.480
My only shame, looking back, the only shame is of course it was for one night only, one

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.040
performance.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:03.840
I mean, we haven't recorded but there seems to be a body of work and a body of music in

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:08.480
particular which is, even now, I can listen to and think it's fabulous.

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:17.440
We often have visitors or colleagues from elsewhere in the world and sometimes from

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.040
carnival cities, you know, etc.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:26.960
And there's a track there that I play quite regularly and put it on, I don't let them

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:34.400
know what it is, and I ask them about the hank of it and then they tell me they feel

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.720
it's exuberant and wonderful.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.520
Who's written this?

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.080
What is this?

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.320
Where did this, where's it from?

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:44.640
And I explain it came from Cardiff and, yeah, largely from your head with all the

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.400
resources that were put together.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.840
And for me that's a very telling moment where they just go like, wow, that could be any

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.320
carnival city in the world, that is carnival music.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:24:01.680
Yeah, I'm really proud of that, I've always, you know, ever since we did that, just because

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:09.760
of the, just at some point we actually, we planned it out and then the money comes

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:14.960
through and then you put all the groups, you get all the groups, you talk to these groups,

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.640
they're interested, you go and meet them and they say, yeah, we'll do it.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:24.400
And then everybody goes away and they say, right, and you say, right, I've got to write

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:30.960
that music now, 45 minutes of music for probably about an hour of music, I can't remember exactly

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.600
the length of it, it was definitely between 45 and an hour.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:34.640
That sounds right.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:39.440
Of all, for all those people and nobody's going to get off stage for the whole time,

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.840
so you've got to try and keep them busy for the whole time.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.120
And that was, and then, and then, and who's going to help me write it?

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.240
Well, nobody.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.040
But it was great.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:52.400
The one great thing about that was that I didn't feel like I was on my own because

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.000
Menna was there as well, Menna Elvin wrote the words for that and she was great because

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.920
she was doing some kind of opera project and she was faxing me lyrics from New York,

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:07.440
this just felt really glamorous, something, something, yeah, just getting the fax of a

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.280
new bit that she'd written from New York.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:14.400
So even though she was doing something in New York and working, developing an idea for

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:19.200
an opera or something, she was still thinking about this piece that we were going to do.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.280
So yeah, that was that was really exciting and but really challenging as well and I

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.120
sweated a lot of that one.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.280
I think you really pulled it off.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:33.040
As you have done with this interview, Rob Smith, what can I say other than it's been

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.520
a pleasure working with you for more than 25 years.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:35.760
Yeah.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:41.040
And yeah, we did have a project in the pipeline again, unfortunately, Money Won't West, which

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:48.160
was called The Demon King and was going to reflect some of your more current musical

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.120
influences and the rest of it.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:53.920
Shall we end just by, can you tell us where you're coming from, what that might hold in

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.240
the future and your trip to media?

00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:03.600
Okay, yeah, well, we around the time, around the time that Madoc happened, which is 1989,

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:12.240
I believe, a way of continuing that relationship that you developed with the Samaj Centre in

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:20.640
Grangetown was to use Vishram Vasani, who is the local, he was a kind of music community

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:25.040
music leader, but obviously the place was also a temple.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:32.480
So it was very much to do with Hindu culture and Gujarat, where a lot of those guys came

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:39.680
from, but it was to build on his expertise in music and to give, to allow the kids in

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.280
on that, bring the kids in on that.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:46.880
And one of the ways that we decided to do that was he would give us pieces of music

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:52.000
to learn and we'd kind of, we'd notate it in Indian notation and then teach the kids

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.040
how to play on keyboards.

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:57.760
So we were kind of, we were kind of cultural intermediaries really between Vishram's

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.720
generation and I suppose his grandchildren or his children's or grandchildren's

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.440
generation.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.280
And that was great because I learned a lot about Indian music on that.

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:15.840
I'd studied Indian music a little bit at university, but it's all very dry and theoretical

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.840
when you do it there, but actually to get your hands dirty and get down there and actually

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:25.280
learn some stuff and then teach it to some Indian kids or kids, Welsh kids, but whose

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.400
ancestry is Indian.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:33.280
That was really exciting and I've always, I've treasured that really as a special place

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:38.800
in my musical treasure chest, if you like, for a long time.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:43.520
And this year I was able to renew that by going to India and working with some top

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.880
flight Indian musicians, put a track together.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:53.360
I went with Jenny Allen and we went over with some Welsh folk music.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:28:02.080
We combined it with Indian ragas and we created a track there with some Indian musicians,

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.360
which is upon SoundCloud as we speak.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:10.960
But also there was the project, there was the, around that time you were mooting a project

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:17.760
which is based on the demon king, the going over to salon and rescuing, is it Princess

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.320
Sita?

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.040
That's right, yeah.

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:21.120
Ravana, evil swine, kidnapper.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:26.480
From, and we were going to do a sort of carnival-esque version of that, but using

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.200
Indian musical influences.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:34.160
And so at some point we should be able, at some point we should be able to do that

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:39.040
because we've now, you know, we've gone to India and done a bit of research and

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:45.920
I kind of know how the music works well enough to kind of draw on that influence to create

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.160
some music that would be specific to the project.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:52.480
And so I think hopefully at some point that project will happen.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.520
I sincerely hope so.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:29:00.640
Because we've done a lot of the groundwork really by applying for little bits of money

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:08.800
from here and there and listening to and working with Indian musicians and all the

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:13.520
ammunition is there to create that project so we should be able to do it at some point.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.960
I sincerely hope to put that funding bullet in the gun and make it happen.

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:24.720
Rob Smith, you are more than the carnival hero with 20 carnivals under your belt.

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.640
Now you're the mainstay of celebratory music in Wales as far as I'm concerned.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.560
Well, we haven't talked about samba.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:38.800
So when we were first doing music with brass, we were very much involved with the samba band

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:39.200
as well.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:46.720
And so I think for me, for the early Swicker carnivals, samba was the sound of the carnival

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.160
and the brass was like more ambition than achievement.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:54.880
The problem with working with the samba band was that there's a lot of them and they play

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.680
really loud.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.920
So obviously we were outgunned a lot of the time.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.080
So in the end, we've kind of done our own thing.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:07.680
But I think the hats off to the samba band because the samba galettes and all that,

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.080
the samba offer is a much more open offer.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:15.200
You need a little bit of instrumental skill to do the brass stuff.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.800
Whereas with samba, it's a very open offer and people can get involved at a very,

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:24.560
you know, beginners can get involved and learn the patterns and work their way up.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:29.040
So I think for me, yeah, probably more samba is the sound of carnival.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:34.720
But I agree, we've sort of contributed something to the sound of carnival and carnival.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.560
I would never downgrade that.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:40.960
I think, no, not yourself, Wonder Brass, the music.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.880
It's been the soundtrack that's animated.

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:46.480
The city streets.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.680
Mr Rob Smith, we thank you and salute you.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.320
Thank you.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.120
Ti ma de.
