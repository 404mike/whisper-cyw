00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840
This is chapter 16 of our series in relation to the race riots in Wales in

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:17.400
1919, June 1919. Chapter 16 is Cardiff riots. Black men in court that's

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.800
Afro-Caribbean, Arab mainly and African. This is part two of the Cardiff riots.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.400
Black men found guilty in Swansea Court as a result of their role in the Cardiff

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.280
riots. Well despite 15 men being taken to court, some with very obvious injuries,

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.800
the court acted in a reasonable and fair way towards them. The press may have

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.520
placed all the blame on the black people of Butetown and Grangetown but the court

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.000
did not. The offences punished were largely unavoidable in terms of

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.840
punishment. They were mainly gun related in relation to violence towards the

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.440
police and shooting directly into the crowd. Black men found guilty were

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:12.560
Muhammad Ali, Ali Abdul, Ivor Gabriel Lansman and Muhammad Qayyid also known as

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:20.440
Ahmed Khalad. So only four men were found guilty. Others found not guilty or no

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:28.200
evidence presented were Ishmael Muhammad, Cham Ali, Sali Abdullah, Sayyid

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:37.120
bin Sayyid, Farah Muhammad, Muhammad Hassan, John Tucker, Muhammad Sharif, Issa

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.480
Muhammad, Muhammad Abederi and John Abdullah. So the four black men

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.400
who found guilty was sentenced to prison in Swansea Court. The four men were as I

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.160
say Ali Abdul who was age 26, a fireman on the merchant ships. He was given four

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.760
days imprisonment for assaulting Frederick Gregory, a police constable. I

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.280
should add he'd already been in prison for nearly seven weeks. Sub-waiting trial.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.080
Ivor Gabriel Lansman was age 21, a ship's cook and he was given a three-year

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.040
prison sentence for shooting at Sydney Jones, William Clarke and James Coombs.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.200
Ahmed Khalad known also as Muhammad Qayyid, age 25, a ship's donkeyman was

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.240
given 15 months hard labour for shooting at John Porter, a police constable.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.840
Muhammad Ali, age 27, was given three months hard labour for shooting at Henry

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.280
Brotherton and Ernest May. Except for John Abdullah who is listed as a

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.620
shopkeeper but was also a boarding house owner, all of the black men were in the

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.700
merchant navy at the time of the riots and therefore it's extremely likely that

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.020
they were also involved in World War One. Now thanks to the Cardiff Story Museum

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.540
we know that a number of people were compensated for loss of goods and damage

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.320
during the riots. The bulk of those being in Butetown. Some of these were among the

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.660
men that appeared in court. The figures I'm going to quote show the actual amount

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.540
received and the modern equivalent in 2017 according to the National Archives

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.620
in London. Muhammad Ali, now he was found guilty in court and was sentenced three

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.660
months hard labour. Nonetheless he received 67 pounds 10 shillings

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.060
compensation, a modern equivalent of a thousand one thousand nine hundred and

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.820
sixty-one pounds and so we can understand that in a real context what

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.900
we're also going to do is quote what that meant if you were a skilled tradesman

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:55.060
that's the high level of salary. So that would have been 204 days wages for a

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.380
skilled tradesman at that time. John Tucker received 30 pounds that's the

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:09.460
equivalent in 2017 of 886 pounds 26 pence 92 days wages.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:19.580
Muhammad Sharif received 14 pounds 421 pounds 34 in 2017 money and 43 days

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:26.420
wages at the time. Now John Abdullah who owned a shop and boarding house which

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.020
was the center of a lot of the damage received a hundred and seventy five

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:37.500
pounds. Now that's the equivalent of just over five thousand pounds and it was

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:47.940
531 days wages. Issa Muhammad received 12 pounds 348 pounds equivalent which is

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:55.620
the equivalent of 36 days wages. Ismail Muhammad received seven pounds 203

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:04.020
pounds 14 in 2017 and 21 days wages. Sayyid bin Sayyid received four pound

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:11.700
116 pounds 23 equivalent and 12 days wages. Fahra Muhammad received five

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:20.780
pound 145 pounds 29 equivalent and 15 days wages. Sali Abdullah received six

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:28.220
pound the equivalent of 174 pounds 35 18 days wages and Muhammad Hassan received

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:37.700
the equivalent 145 pounds 29 and 15 days wages. So although the events were

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.460
savage and caused some serious physical injury to the black merchant seaman the

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.020
treatment they received in court reflected the fact that they did not

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:53.860
start the riot. Also the compensation amounts were significant at that time so

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.020
despite the press consistently for most of June placing the blame for the Cardiff

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.500
riots on black people living in Cardiff that was not the conclusion reached by

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.900
the court and they received compensation for loss of belongings and damage to

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:14.020
property. It's interesting to note that even that these events occurred 20 years

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:20.260
before the start of World War one World War two and despite racist attacks

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.100
brutality by white mobs and overt threat to their families these black

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:31.860
people returned to the sea in World War two to assist Britain. In World War two

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:39.420
at least 645 Arab merchant seamen serving on the British Navy merchant

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:49.500
navy died. Of the 479 men who listed their last known address 242 sailed out

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:59.580
of Wales. 30 from Barry 12 from Swansea 10 from Newport 189 from Cardiff. Our

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:06.700
research shows that 330 men born in the Caribbean died serving on the UK merchant

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:13.940
navy in World War two. 56 of those listed their last known address as Wales. Three

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:22.660
from Newport 11 from Barry and 42 from Cardiff. These men left at least 35 wives

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:29.140
behind in Wales. Also there were sisters daughters brothers and mothers listed in

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:36.180
next of kin. Now this shows that the riots racism attacks failure of

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.540
government unions and others to support men none of this changed their

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:45.460
commitment to settling in Wales and becoming black citizens in an often

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:52.460
unfriendly environment. This is really important because for those of us who

00:07:52.460 --> 00:08:00.700
are black but of mixed race third generation nowadays and fourth and fifth

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:11.260
generation the statement of intent made by those people during and after the

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:18.700
1919 race riots after having been involved in World War one and after a

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:23.780
tremendous loss of life in World War one within their community that statement

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:31.540
is why we're citizens of Wales today. Now in chapters 17 to 20 will show the

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:36.940
brutality of the environment in the United States an environment that also

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:47.420
had race riots in 1919 an environment ruled by Britain's closest allies.
