WEBVTT

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The Ushads

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.480
We are

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.480
The Ushads

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.300
We are

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.360
The Ushads

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.680
We are

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.080
The Abbegelli Ushad

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.960
And we've been working on a project called

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.480
The Myths and Legends of North Wales

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.520
Because guess what?

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.680
Abbegelli is in North Wales, duh!

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.040
Yeah, and in North Wales we have the best stories

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.480
So now we are going to tell you the traditional story of Rhys and Maynia

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.520
A dark and twisted tale

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.800
And then afterwards

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.120
We will tell you

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.080
Our own special version of the story of Rhys and Maynia

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.040
An even darker and twisted tale

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.440
Erm, sorry, there's no such word as twisted-er

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.600
Okay, an even more dark and twisted tale

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.720
So, first of all, Rhys and Maynia, the traditional version

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.360
Once upon a time, in a beautiful little village called Porthonantyn Gwynedd

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.240
In a small valley at the foot of a mountain

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.200
Beside the sea, there lived two cousins, Rhys and Maynia

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.400
They were childhood sweethearts

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.960
Will you be my sweetheart, Rhys?

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.200
Yes, if you will be mine

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.280
Their favourite place to meet was under an ancient oak tree at the foot of a mountain

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.960
One day, meeting up with the old oak, they decided to get married

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.120
Will you marry me, Rhys?

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.720
Thought you'd never ask

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.040
Hang on a minute

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.960
Cousins aren't supposed to marry each other, are they?

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.920
I mean, look at the Hasbigs

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.080
Who?

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.400
They were like this royal family

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.760
Ruled Austria, Germany and the Holy Roman Empire for centuries

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.880
Kept marrying their cousins

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.840
And because of all the inbreeding, ended up looking really weird

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.920
With weird sticky-out eyes, weird sticky-out noses and weird sticky-out jaws

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.600
We would

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.280
OK, maybe Rhys and Maynia weren't cousins then

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.720
It's only a legend, we can change it

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.440
But they definitely decided to get married

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.280
In Clannog Church

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.120
That's a real church, you can go there, big one, quite fancy, posh

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.960
In Rhys and Maynia's village, there was this old tradition

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.560
Whenever there was a wedding, the bride would get ready in her bridal dress

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.600
Then run off and hide somewhere

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.680
The bride groom would wait in the church

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.560
And all the guests would go and look for the bride

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.320
And find her and bring her back to the church

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.920
Like hide and seek for grown-ups

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.000
So, on the big day, Mayna got ready in her bridal dress

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.800
Then off went Rhys to the church

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.760
And off went Mayna to hide

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.240
And off the guests went to look for her

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.520
Leaving only the priest in the church

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.600
With the excited bride groom

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.400
I can't wait for her to come through those doors

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.720
My heart is racing

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.720
I've got her a flower, a wildflower

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.960
She'll like that

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.240
Rhys waited and waited

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.200
And waited

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.360
They're taking a long time, aren't they, Father Brynne?

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.120
Something must have happened

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.880
Perhaps she's got lost

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.280
I'm sure they'll find her soon

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.240
Let's take it forever

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.840
The flower is wilting

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.880
At last

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.200
There's my best man, Tom Ross

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.400
My other friend, Godric

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.960
Mayna's mam

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.920
All the other guests

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.880
But...

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.960
No Mayna?

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.760
Where is she?

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.400
Please, we can't find her

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.600
We've looked everywhere

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.480
On the beach

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.720
Around by the dock

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.920
Up on the mountain

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.280
Even in the forest

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.400
We've done everything we could to find her

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.840
But she's just...

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.640
Vanished

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.960
My lovely daughter

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.960
Missing

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.560
It's freezing our thirties

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.600
And you can barely see

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.240
I'm so sorry, Rhys

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.240
But I think the wedding's off

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.640
Maybe she's run away

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.640
A cold feet

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.360
No, she'd never do that

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.880
She'd never abandon me

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.960
She's lost

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.400
Or hurt

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.480
That's the only possible explanation

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.680
Yes

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.480
That's it

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.040
She's had an accident

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.120
I'm going to go and look for her myself

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.040
So the wedding can go on

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.880
Yes

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.440
Do please keep looking for her, Rhys

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.800
Though, even if you find her now

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.920
It's a bit late for me to marry you today

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.960
It'll have to be next week

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.640
Don't get your hopes up, Rhys

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.360
We've looked for well

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.840
It feels like hours

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.920
And there's no sign of her at all

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.560
You don't understand what it's like to really love someone

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.160
Do you, Thomas?

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.560
I'm going to look for her

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.640
And I'm going to go on looking until I find her

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.440
And that's what he did

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.200
Rhys looked for Mania for the rest of the day

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.080
And for many days after that

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.280
And for many weeks

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.440
And for many months

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.600
I will never give up

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.840
God

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.960
If you'll only bring her back to me

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.360
I'll go to the church every week

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.960
And help Father Bryn with the Sunday school for the rest of my days

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.520
I promise

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.120
Just help me to find her again

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.480
But Rhys never did find Mania

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.640
And slowly, slowly

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.040
He went mad with grief

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.760
One day when Rhys was wandering round the mountain looking for Mania

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.600
A terrible storm blew up

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.200
He took shelter by his and Mania's favourite old oak tree

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.440
While he was sheltering

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.880
Lightning hit the tree

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.600
BOOM

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.080
And the tree split open

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.720
To reveal inside

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.080
A skeleton dressed in what was left of a wedding gown

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.480
Bones

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.840
Just bones

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.480
And a little piece of her dress

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.080
Mania had hidden in the old oak

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.160
She wheezed it in through a tiny crack

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.560
And then got stuck

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.960
She starved to death, poor Mania

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.080
Poor Rhys

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.960
For the story has it

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.760
That Rhys then also died of a broken heart

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.320
Well, we told you it was a dark and twisted tale

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.120
But if you think that was dark and twisted

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.080
Wait until you get a load of our version of the story

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.920
Here we go

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.760
Rhys and Mania

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.880
The Abigail Youth Shag Gothic version

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.040
So, in our version

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.640
The real truth behind the story is that

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.640
Rhys and Mania

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.240
Are the real truth behind the story

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.480
And the real truth behind the story

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.200
The real version, the real truth behind the legend is

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.280
That Mania had fallen in love with Rhys' best friend, Thomas

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.320
And they were having a sneaky affair

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.880
The day before the wedding

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.960
They met up in Thomas' cottage

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.880
For what was supposed to be the last time

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.440
Oh, what am I going to do, Tom?

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.120
I just don't want to marry him anymore

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.400
Then don't

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.760
Run away with me instead

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.160
But it's tomorrow

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.800
I can't let him down

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.000
Let the whole village down

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.320
Yes, you can

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.640
You don't love him

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.880
You love me

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.960
Run away with me, Mania

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.680
I can't, he loves me

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.520
And you know Rhys

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.880
If I disappear

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.640
He'll come looking for me

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.960
And he'll never stop

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.360
He'll go on and on

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.880
Until he finds me

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.440
Finds us

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.720
What if we were to get on a boat?

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.960
Go and live in some other country

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.440
He'll follow me wherever I go

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.720
Oh, I wish I could die

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.160
Did you say die?

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.120
Hang on a minute

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.040
I think I have an idea

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:43.960
That night

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.440
If you were to pass through the graveyard of Clunagh Church

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.280
You would have seen a very strange sight

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.840
I'm not sure I can go through with this, Tom

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.520
Do you want to go home?

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.800
No, but I feel really bad about this

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.120
It's not exactly ethical, is it?

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.280
What we're doing?

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.000
It's the only way

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.360
All right, this is really what it takes

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.760
Pass me the lantern

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.280
Hey, this is my father's grave

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.320
You always hated him

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.280
Revenge at last

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.160
What?

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.680
Don't be dumb, Mania

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.600
It needs to be a woman

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.320
Don't call me dumb

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.760
And aren't men's and women's skeletons the same?

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.280
No, they're completely different

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.120
Well, I didn't know that

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.720
How would I know that?

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.200
Just start looking for a woman's grave

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.400
We just split up in case we call

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.640
Easier to find a convincing excuse if it's just one of us

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.560
Yeah, what convincing excuse would that be?

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.440
Here, what about this one with all the flowers?

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.520
Jackpot, pass me the shovel

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.840
What's that?

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.480
Oh no, Tom, someone's coming

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.920
Must be Father Brent

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.840
Quick, behind the graveyard, hide

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.920
That was a close shave

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.040
Or a close grave

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.320
I love your jokes, Tom, but not now

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.960
Who's there?

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.480
Oh no, it wasn't the priest, it's

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.920
Godric

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.320
Tom, what the hell are you doing?

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.400
You're digging up a grave?

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.120
We'd better come clean

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.040
We've been having a secret affair behind Reacher's back

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.840
And now we're digging up a body

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.680
So we can fake Maynard's death

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.040
So she doesn't have to marry him

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.360
We're going to hide the body in this stupid old oak tree

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.440
So we won't find it for a while

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.600
That'll explain why it's all rotted away

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.040
By then we'll be far away, married

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.400
Epic plan

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.440
You can turn us in now

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.680
Turn you in? No way

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.280
Anything, just right, Elise

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.080
I've always hated him

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.160
Give me the shovel

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.240
I'll dig up this body for you in no time

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:22.560
Tom, I think I've hit the coffin

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.400
OK, we need to lift out

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.040
Oh wow, it's heavy, I thought

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:32.760
Right, let's pry this open

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.400
Have to wedge the shovel

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.520
Into the space

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.640
Put some mud in the bottom

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.000
Get on with it

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.840
We haven't got all night

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.880
There it is, one skeleton

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.080
Yuck

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.680
Lift it out quick and shove it in the sack

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.200
What if they realise it's missing?

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.680
We need to put the coffin back and fill the hole in

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.800
Really? We'll be here all night

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.400
Just fill it in Godric

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.880
The next day, Meenir got dressed in her bridal finery

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.360
And went running off, as she told the wedding guests, to hide

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:27.720
In fact, she ran as fast as she could to Tom's cottage

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:32.640
Meanwhile, Rhys, the proud groom, stood waiting in the church

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.840
As Tom, Godric and the other wedding guests

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.960
Set off on a traditional search for the bride

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.800
I can't wait for us to come through those doors

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.000
My heart is racing

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.280
I've got a flower, a wild flower

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.720
She'll like that

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:53.720
But really, Tom and Godric secretly headed at top speed to Tom's cottage

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.360
To meet Meenir there

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.280
Quick, we haven't much time

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.720
Meenir, get your dress off

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.840
Turn you back, Godric

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.440
Godric, where's the sack?

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.600
I've got it here

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.720
Tip it out then

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.880
OK, let's get the dress on the skeleton, head first

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.960
That's not the head hole, Godric, that's an arm hole

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.640
How would I know?

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.320
Now you're putting it on backwards

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.160
Oh no, the skeleton's falling to bits

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.200
How are we going to put that lot back together?

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.840
Just have to try, Godric, pass me that leg

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.760
Sometime later, Meenir, dressed in her ordinary clothes

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.720
Secretly slipped away to start her new life

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:39.240
While Thomas and Godric rejoined the other guests and headed for the church

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.080
Rhys, we can't find her

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.360
We've looked everywhere, on the beach, round by the dock

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.920
Up on the mountain, even in the forest

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:58.280
We've done everything we could to find her, but she's just vanished

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.640
My lovely daughter, missing

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.280
It's freezing out there, Rhys, and you can barely see

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:08.240
I'm so sorry, Rhys, but I think the wedding's off

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.280
Maybe she's run away, like a cold feet

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.200
No, she'd never do that, she'd never abandon me

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.160
She's lost, or hurt

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.360
That's the only possible explanation

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.720
I'm going to go and look for her myself

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.560
So the wedding can go on

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.640
Don't get your hopes up, Rhys, we've looked for...

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.440
Well, it feels like hours, and there's no sign of her at all

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:35.600
You don't understand what it's like to really love someone, do you, Thomas?

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.680
Hmm, little does he know

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:43.320
I'm going to look for her, and I'm going to go on looking until I find her

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.520
And offset Rhys on his hopeless search

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:51.400
Two days later, having secretly planted the skeleton in the oak tree

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:55.120
Thomas announced to Rhys that he'd found a new job

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.280
and left the village to join Mania in a hotel in Rhyl

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.320
And Rhys carried on looking and gradually went mad

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:06.600
until the day he eventually found the skeleton he thought was Mania's in the tray

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.360
And Godric never said a word

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.920
And Mania and Thomas lived happily ever after

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.040
In Rhyl

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:19.280
And that is our version of the story of Rhys and Mania

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.760
Choose to believe whichever one you write

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.560
But we think the one that's the most fun is the one by the...

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.520
Abigail Ushad! Yes!

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.400
We are...

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.120
Ushad!

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.280
We are...

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:03.120
Ushad!

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.800
Ushad!

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.960
We are...

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.760
Ushad!

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.520
Ushad!

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.760
We are...

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:27.360
Ushad!
