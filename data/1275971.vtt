00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.320
In our continuing examination of the race riots in Wales in 1919, this chapter relates

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.680
to the race riots in Barry in 1919.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.200
First of all there is a need to be clear. The race riots were direct attacks by hundreds

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.840
of white men, mainly men, on black people. They attacked them in the street, chasing

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.520
and pursuing, then beating them if they could, and they burnt down and ransacked their homes

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.280
and lodging houses. In Cardiff white women living with black men were stripped and beaten

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.440
by the mob. The first of the race riots actually broke out in Newport on 6th June when it was

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.080
alleged that a black man had made an insulting remark to a white woman. A white soldier then

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.200
attacked him. Violence quickly flared as an angry mob of white people began attacking at

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.880
random or perceived non-white people, who then began responding in kind with whatever

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:10.800
they had to hand, including sticks, posters, pokers, razors, knives and in some cases revolvers.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:18.640
The Nottingham Evening Post, 12th June 1919. Fatal Afray in Barry. A soldier named Henry

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.340
Longman, aged 30, was fatally stabbed in the street in Barrylast. A negro is detained in

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.940
connection with the soldier's death. Crowds of white men and women surrounded the police

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.580
station. They were dispersed, but disturbance followed in various many streets where men

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.420
of colour were known to reside. Windows were smashed and property damaged.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:52.540
Western Mail, 12th June 1919. Barry riots started because, quote, the black way laid

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:59.180
him, Fred Longman, seized him by the throat, pinned him against the wall and stabbed him

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.780
under the heart. According to court records, a witness, Louisa Richards, coloured woman

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:13.260
married to a coloured man now at sea who lived at 17 Beverley Street but now lives at Harvey

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.420
Street, said Longman was standing in his doorway when prisoner Charles Emmanuel and another

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.340
coloured man entered the street. Prisoners spoke to the witness and the other man walked

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.340
on. Longman came up and asked, Emmanuel, can't you find a street of your own to walk in?

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.420
Emmanuel replied that he was not doing any harm, whereupon Longman struck him. A struggle

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.900
ensued and Longman was pinned up against a wall. Two men came across and one man struck

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.300
Emmanuel with his fist. The other man got a poker and Emmanuel, who relaxed his hold

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:59.300
of Longman, pulled out a knife. Louisa Richards saw Longman make another dart at the prisoner

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.340
and Longman then staggered and fell bleeding. Although she was only a few miles away, she

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:13.340
said she did not see Emmanuel actually stab Longman. This was a time when violence and

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.340
crime were entirely normal parts of people's lives, especially in docks towns. Frederick

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.120
Longman was a convicted thief and had also been arrested for assaulting a police officer.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.580
This continued during his service in the army, during which time he was charged with various

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:39.020
offences by the army. He had served as a driver in World War I but had been discharged in

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:46.220
February 1919 after suffering from dysentery. Although the papers described him as a soldier,

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.100
all that actually meant was that he was in the discharge period when he would have been

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.940
receiving insurance payments after leaving the army. He was not in fact a serving soldier

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.020
and his pension would have run out on October 19. He was a resident of Fairford Street,

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.140
Haddockston for at least 10 years and he left a wife and three young children. Charles

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.780
Emmanuel was a fireman, a merchant seamen working below decks and as he operated from

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.140
Barry Docks he would also have been directly involved in World War I. We cannot now say

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:29.060
who started the fight between Emmanuel and Longman and others, but we know that 36-year-old

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:36.260
Frederick Longman was killed and Emmanuel was arrested. At Swansea Town Hall of Sizes,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:43.260
45-year-old French Caribbean seamen Charles Emmanuel was charged on the 22nd of July 1919

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:50.380
that he did quote, willfully and of malice of Thorford kill and murder one Frederick

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:57.380
Henry Longman, unquote. However, murder was not proven and Emmanuel received a sentence

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.020
of manslaughter with a prison term of five years.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:09.020
Western Mail 13th June 1919. Scenes at Barry. Houses damaged, but no personal violence.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.860
There was a slight renewal of outbreaks at Barry on Thursday, the paper says. Excited

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.100
crowds settled in the streets of Haddockston and the home of many of the coloured seamen

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:28.580
were visited. Damage was done to the houses by the smashing of windows, etc. But fortunately

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.060
the strong form of police available, together with the heavy rains which fell, damped the

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.940
ardour of the crowd and eventually prevented anything like a serious disturbance. And but

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.500
little personal violence was indulged in. What might have developed into an ugly incident

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:53.220
was prevented by the prompt action of the police. It appears that about 50 workmen early

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.480
in the afternoon went to a fish and chip shop in Holton Road which is kept by a woman whose

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.260
husband is a negro. A large crowd gathered on the scene but the police had been sent

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.960
and formed a cordon. They prevented the workmen from entering the premises and carry out their

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:16.180
threats of molesting the coloured men. Murder charge. Further arrests. Three coloured men

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.700
were arrested at Haddockston on Thursday for having small arms and other dangerous

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:26.820
weapons of offence in their possession and they will also come up for trial today. The

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:32.540
violence against black seamen was to continue for a few more days during which Tyrone Ernest

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:39.540
Jackman was chased from his home in Beverley Street by a mob. Jackman had served through

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:46.540
the war in France with the Queen's rifle. He was arrested by the police on the 11th

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:53.060
of June and sent to court and found guilty of wounding John Goldsworthy. He was fined

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:59.240
Â£10 and told to be of good behaviour for 12 months. As tensions rose some of the wives

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.380
of black seamen took their children and went to stay with family and friends in the Rhondda

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.840
Valley until their husbands returned from sea and things calmed down. As with other

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:15.080
areas the local authorities and government tried to persuade black seamen to accept repatriation,

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:21.840
a free boat ride home, a one way journey. This was not accepted in Barry, especially

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.520
as many men had families and this may be the point at which they actually decided to become

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:33.480
British, choosing family over land of their birth. In fact a number of them, like Leonard

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:40.200
Hines, chose to leave the sea and become miners. The events of June 1919 in Barry are

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:46.600
not common knowledge locally and little has been written about them in the 100 years since.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:52.040
Only recently has this secret history been publicised but it is still not the topic of

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:58.540
school work which is a shame for many reasons, not least because the grandchildren and great

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:05.020
grandchildren of that generation do not know that the black seamen and soldiers and white

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:11.780
wives clearly made a decision to remain in Barry and Wales which is the reason those

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.780
young relatives are citizens of Wales.
