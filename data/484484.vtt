Interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Venue The Swicker Office.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The date, Monday the 3rd of November.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Interviewee Amanda Thompson.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Amanda, for the record, could you please spell your name in full?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Yeah, my name is Amanda, that's A-M-A-N-D-A.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Thompson, which is spelled T-H-O-M-P-S-O-N.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Amanda, you've got a long and venerable history in helping the Carnival come about.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Would you care to tell us about your initial involvement and that which happened thereafter?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Yes, I came to work for Swicker initially part-time and I started in 1995.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And I worked as an assistant to Steve for nine years until 2003.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So I saw quite a few different manifestations of the Cardiff Carnival over that time.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And various different people who worked on it.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And every year an increase in the number of people that took part in it.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Are there any costumes that stick in your mind in particular?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I have to say, as the co-organiser with myself, we weren't able to wear costumes because the police never recognised us as the organisers.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.000
But in our picture archive there will certainly be the classic picture of you as, I like to call you Miss Wales, a giant backpack costume.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
That's right.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
In red, white and green, holding two white flags as well.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
That's right. That was in 2005.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
That was the Wales window on the world carnival, wasn't it?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Yeah.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So I will have to have a costume next year then to mark the 10th year since then.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Yeah, that was a great opportunity to wear a great big backpack costume, which I think I've always wanted to have done that.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I'm glad I got a chance to do that.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
You did actually let me take part in the carnival in the first year when I joined in 1995.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Oh, excellent. What were you doing in the first one?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Because I was so very new and you thought you can't work on carnival, you can't go out there, promote carnival, you can't tell other people why they should get involved unless you've experienced it yourself.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So that's what happened. I took part in that. It was one of the dancing groups, if I remember rightly.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And yeah, I think, you know, the number one thing about carnival is about transformation.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
That's what it does. It transforms you. You never forget that experience.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And that's why people should take part.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Quite right, too. There'd be lots of different sort of, what should we say, different ways in which parading has always been perennial and will always be part of the carnival experience.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
But back in the day, of course, we used to show ourselves on the steps of the National Museum.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
That's right. Yeah.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And as I talk to different people, I kind of have a feeling that that was a bit of a golden age.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I mean, can you remember what that felt like?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
It was a golden age. It wasn't that staged either.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I mean, we did prepare to a certain extent, but a lot of it just kind of happened spontaneously.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
We were lucky because very little ever really went wrong.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
But some really terrific things came out of that.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:43.000
But these were in the days, I think, before all the health and safety kicked in and and lots of other restrictions, really.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
There was more space. We had maybe a little bit more freedom to do things.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000
But now you have, of course, a lot more staged performances, but you also spread it out a lot more.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I think a lot more people get to see it now.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
You just have to change with the times, really.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
But I think every year we did it. You know, the standard changed.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Things got better and better and better, didn't they? Absolutely.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And the people that you have making the costumes now have sort of picked up on a lot.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And that's what's gone on in the past and developed their skills.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And it's really quite a professional.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I think that's what I'm quite telling is that quite a high percentage of the current team of artists

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:33.000
certainly the artistic coordinator, Adrian Spinola, have actually grown through the project and started as community participants themselves.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I think that's very real. They were, you know.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Well, Adrian did, didn't he? Absolutely.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
I remember when he first started, he just kind of walked through the door one day and then took part.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And then he brought along a few of his neighbors from the same streets that wanted to get involved.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And it just kind of grew and grew and grew.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And he's he must have learned loads along the way. Yes.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
You know, and a lot of it with carnival is trial and error, isn't it?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Oh, gosh, there's no right or wrong in carnival.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Other than if the costume works, it works and you'll know.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And you'll know. Yes.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And also, I think that there's been so many different influences from different cultures along the years as well.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
You've had makers on this carnival project that really, you know, they were Caribbean.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:27.000
You've also got a lot from all different parts of Wales and a lot of different other cultures, European and South American and Far East and whatever mixed into it as well.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:38.000
So I feel that after these 25 years, what you've got here is just a really unique, genuinely multicultural product for the diff.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Yes.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Yes, and which in a way is by virtue of being made in Wales by Welsh people of every shape, size, queen, color is definitively Welsh.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Of course, carnival camp is a, you know, is where it all happens, isn't it?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
The mini village of creativity.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Do you have any fun moments based on?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
I mean, it's got to be Cattay's Community Center then, isn't it?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
How on earth did we squash everything into that space?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Somehow we did. It was always rammed.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
The days down at Butetown Youth Pavilion with a lot more space were good.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
We made it here too, didn't we? One year in the studio here in Chapter.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Yeah.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I remember that. That was that was good. That was quite popular with people.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So it's gone all over. Where are you now? Fitz Allen High School.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Fitz Allen High School. And it's gone down very well indeed.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
So and the joy of Fitz Allen is that A, we have enough space indoors.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000
But in order to parade properly, we need to be able to rehearse people out of doors so that they're dancing into space and the rest of it.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
So we had far more space to actually practice parading, which I think is very important.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Cattay's was very difficult.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Very difficult. There was nowhere.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
No.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Here was very difficult, really, in terms of outdoor space.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Did a bit of. Yeah.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And we used other venues like Mount Stewart. Yes.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
School and that. Yes.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:17.000
What do you think of some of the the outcomes down the bay when there was more money around and there were bigger stages and we might have a headliner provided by the by the county council?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Actually, I think the ones that have worked best are the ones that we've done that off stage because the stage, a big stage, you can you've only got certain sight lines.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I think a lot of what you've done since has really increased the accessibility to people.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
I guess in an ideal world, you'd like a mix of both, wouldn't you?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
You'd maybe like to do a big stage show.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I think in an ideal world would like to.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Yes. And not necessarily all the same day.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:00.000
There was a point where we before austerity to hold that we were hoping to build it up into a week long week long or at least a long weekend.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Nothing else. Yeah.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Which could really lend itself to that because you've got so much to show off there.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Yes. I think with the big shows, it was a lot more pressure because you had to produce quite a polished finished show.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And then it would rain.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And Carnival is so spontaneous. Sometimes community participants being spontaneous does not equal a polished performed show.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
You'll have seen a number of carnivals take place in the rain.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Ah yes.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Do you remember the the Blue Devils?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Yeah.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And the fact that we have to.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000
So these are body painted Blue Devils brought over from Paramen in Trinidad, Spooky and Catcher.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And they taught us a tradition from the Caribbean that involves painting your body blue, surprisingly.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Of course, in Cardiff, it totally tipped out on the day, didn't it?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And they had to be followed round by a special team of bucketers with blue dye.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Every five minutes, was it washed off with throw another bucket of blue on them, which I thought was quite funny.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Only in Wales.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Yeah, absolutely. And also, if you're looking at the street when the carnivals passed down in the rain, you just got this kind of mix of glitter and paint and bits of costumes that line in the street behind you.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
So it's quite a nice. It's good for that, though, isn't it, Rain?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
It is good for that.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
But there were quite a few years when we didn't get rained on at all.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
I'm surprised so little was rained off over those years.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Well, in many senses, we've never been rained off.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I thought, I mean, we're weatherproof in the sense that it goes ahead, whatever happens.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000
You know, I mean, people have worked for at least three weeks, you know, and probably longer in their heads to get it together.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And we have that one off opportunity. We don't have the opportunity to reschedule things, do we?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I mean, once you've got your road closures in place.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
I remember a few and I think this is carnival spin offs really.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Costumes remade costumes with a lot of plastic waterproofing involved.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
You remember that we did quite a lot of that.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And here's the memory that just popped into my head was the course we were preparing down at the town center in Grangetown on the day that Princess Diana died.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Yes. And that was announced and that was canceled.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And that it was a re a re a remount for Cardiff Bay Development Corporation.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And I suppose if we're going to tell the story in full, it was the first time we've ever tried to remount a carnival parade.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And whilst we've had hundreds of enthusiastic carnivalists and community participants in the original parade,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
we had formed a contract with Cardiff Bay Development Corporation,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:51.000
which we then used the money to actually fund the original parade on the basis that hundreds of these people would come back and do it all again.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
I can recall you and I being there and being somewhat bemused and then horrified by the low turnout.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And then, of course, we turned on the radio to discover that Lady Di had in fact died and public events across the UK were canceled.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Football matches, everything.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.000
So on one level, what can I say other than had that not happened?

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Well, perhaps all the other Cardiff carnivals might not have happened.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000
We would have been hard pushed, as you know, because I mean, you were running the books as much as everything else.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
We would have been hard pushed to repay that money to CBDC.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
So, yeah, it's not our fault really that one.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
No, no, no, absolutely not.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
No, it's been such a powerful thing.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
It's amazing. I am amazed.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Actually, I have to say everybody for posterity.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
The fact that Steve has kept this going for 25 years,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:01.000
25 years in the face of quite a lot of adversity often and always a struggle with finances,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
always a struggle, never really knowing what money is going to be there to do it.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
The fact it's been going for 25 years is an incredible achievement.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And talking of incredible achievements, we wish at this point to award you Amanda Thompson, the honorary title.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
No money goes with it of carnival hero for nine years,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000
joining me at the helm in Swicka producing these fabulous events for the community at large.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Thank you very much indeed. You're welcome.
