So what machinery did you have on the farm then? When you started off, would you have had tractors at the beginning?

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:15.520
Well, a horse, a share horse we had in the beginning. But the tractor soon came and the fordson back, we had the fordson.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.920
That was a great help in the beginning for my father.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:28.200
Did you have anything else except the tractor? Did you have a binder on the farm or did you borrow that?

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.800
Well, I think my father had a binder himself. A lot of farms didn't even have a binder.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:41.800
They took it to the whole field, maybe with a scythe. But we had a binder and that was a great help.
