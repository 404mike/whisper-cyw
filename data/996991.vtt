00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.880
I'm the owner of the great Yehomah,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.280
Filled well through this barren land.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.680
I am free because thou art mighty,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.280
Holy is thy powerful hand.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.800
Strong deliver, strong deliver,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.680
Behold still my strength and shield.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:46.360
Behold still my strength and shield.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.080
Our rules are the rules of the world,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.880
We bear the will of thy strength.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.480
Thou art our God and Thou art our Lord,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.200
Thou art our God and Thou art our light.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.040
Our rules are the rules of the world,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:22.360
Thou art our God and Thou art our light.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:30.360
Our rules are the rules of the world,

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.320
Our rules are the rules of the world,

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.280
We bear the will of thy strength.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.080
Thou art our God and Thou art our light,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.080
Our rules are the rules of the world,

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.000
Glory be to thee, glory be to thee,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.160
Evermore we praise thee, evermore we praise thee,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.720
Thou art our God and Thou art our light,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.800
Glory be to thee, glory be to thee,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:28.320
Evermore we praise thee, evermore we praise thee,

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:37.120
Evermore we praise thee, evermore we praise thee,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.000
Glory be to thee, glory be to thee,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.720
Behold still my strength and shield.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:00.720
Behold still my strength and shield.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.880
Glory be to thee, glory be to thee,

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:14.560
Evermore we praise thee, evermore we praise thee,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:23.560
