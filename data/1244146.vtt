What is your favorite memory of May?

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.120
My favorite memory of May? My favorite memory of May of you becoming my wife.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.120
That's a future thought, isn't it?

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.620
Yeah.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.620
I can't think of that.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.620
About holidays or engagements.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.420
Oh, my favorite is to be engaged to you.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.860
Yeah, yeah.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.860
Last year, last December.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.860
The 18th, 2018.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.860
18th, yeah.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.860
And this year coming, it'll be our anniversary.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.860
First anniversary?

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.860
Yes.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.860
Getting engaged.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.860
What's your favorite memory of James Caroline?

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.860
He texted me last night and said,

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.860
Where do you want to get married?

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.860
An anniversary?

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.860
Or on holiday?

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.860
I don't know, I've got to think about it.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.860
I haven't decided yet.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.860
Yet, haven't I?

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.860
No, you haven't yet.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.860
Have a good think about it.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.860
Yeah.
