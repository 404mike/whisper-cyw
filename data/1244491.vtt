00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We didn't move in together first.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
No.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So that was a big change after the wedding?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Yes. It was.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We didn't move in.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Two giant steps.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We didn't move in to begin with.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
That's very true, isn't it, Chris?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Yes, and we would...

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I didn't think it was a good idea to move in together.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
No, that didn't happen.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So, a big change for you as well, Chris?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Yes.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Was there some adjustment that you needed to make?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
What were they?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
How did you get used to Dai being around all the time?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Dai said it was weird sharing a bed with somebody else, didn't it?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Yes, sharing a bed.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It is when you're used to sleeping on your own, isn't it?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Yes.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Yes.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
People stealing the quill and fidgeting.
