Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.840
Interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.600
Location Swickert Office Market House in Canton Cardiff.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.040
And the date today is Monday the 21st of September.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.200
John, would you be kind enough to spell your name in full for the record?

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.240
Right, okay.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.840
I'm well known as John from young school age, but my Indian name is Rajinder Singh,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:44.040
which is spelled R-A-J-I-N-D-E-R and surname Singh S-I-N-G-H.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.480
Raj, would you be kind enough to do the same?

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:55.680
Yep, most definitely. Mine is spelled R-A-J-A, surname Singh S-I-N-G-H.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.680
For listeners in the future, I'll point out from the onset that of course John and Raj are father and son.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.080
So the dynamic duo, as I like to think of you both.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.880
When do you first remember getting involved in Carnival, Cardiff Carnival?

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.280
Well, many years it's been from what I can remember.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:31.280
From I think at least about say, I remember overall, it's been about say 20 odd years.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.280
Yeah, 20 years.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.280
Or 20 odd years from what I can remember. I can't remember exact dates.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.880
But I remember it was over 20 years ago.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:54.880
So from seeing many other Carnivals and then saw a Carnival here and then working with Bhangra

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.880
and then just seeing a great development in Carnival. So I'll put a light to it.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:09.880
I remember myself, I actually have a picture going back about 20 years ago when I was about 6, 7 years old.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.880
Taking part in the mass Carnival. So yeah, most definitely it's been a good 20 years.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.880
Is this a picture where perhaps as part of your fantastic Bhangra performance on Parade,

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.880
you actually ended up on the shoulders of your father?

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.880
Because I have a picture which again we'll be putting online in the archive

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.880
where having performed a number of acrobatic moves, you then got on top of John's shoulders

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.880
and you appear to be going down the haze at the time, which I thought was rather wonderful, like an acrobat.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.880
That wasn't that, the picture I have is not that specific one.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.880
However, yeah, I'm sure it is some of that kind as well. We've got loads. I've got some doing sword fighting as well.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.880
I remember when I was a youngster doing the Carnival, drumming, dancing, as we've done so many different things in the Carnival.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:07.880
For those who don't know, Bhangra, what is it? Where does it come from? How did it arrive here in Cardiff in Wales?

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.880
Originally stems from India. It's celebrated during the harvest periods.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.880
This is where it originates from a long, long time ago.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.880
However, bringing it to Cardiff, I suppose my dad can answer that more better than myself.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.880
Over to you, John.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.880
As my son speaks, he's quite right.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:42.880
The start of it really started from the Saki time, which is very known around the world, especially in India at the harvest time.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:04:02.880
And as my father, when he came over from India in 1963, 64, he came over and as they used to do it there, they done it here as well with a few of their cousins and colleagues.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:10.880
And from there, there was a very, very few artists in the Asian community.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:20.880
And from what I recall, what my father said, there was only one in Scotland as a Bhangra dancer and one of them.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.880
And everywhere where they went, they did a really nice show.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:35.880
And one of the famous places they did, which was in London, is it the...

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.880
Not the Palladium, it's another one, which is a very famous one, which I can't remember.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.880
Anyway, they've done it there and they really, really liked it.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:56.880
And from there, we, as he got older and then we took over and from we taking over, now the third generation is taking over, which is my son.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:13.880
But it's been very colourful and very sort of nice to do carnivals as well in a very diplomatic way, different, different workshops, different things.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.880
And it's been very enjoyable.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:23.880
Carnival, particularly when it's on the road and we're there with our big audiences, we need music to dance to, to power us on.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.880
It's like the fuel in our engine.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:33.880
And you guys and your family and friends and your colleagues have provided that with a very special instrument called the dhol.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.880
Can you tell us a bit more about the dhol and what it is and what makes it so wonderful for...

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.880
I mean, you know, I don't want to give it away.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.880
Over to you guys. You're the experts.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.880
So the dhol is part of Indian percussion as well.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.880
A family of approximately four or five other drums.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.880
But the dhol is used during all celebrations periods.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.880
Most importantly, Vasaki, Harvest Time, as we originally stated.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.880
This is a very loud instrument played with two sticks.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:11.880
It's approximately a metre and a half big, long, shall I say, carried on the shoulders with a strap.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.880
It's very, very loud.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.880
So you can imagine five to ten of them being played at one time.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:23.880
And it's for people to dance to, Bhangra dancers or what have you, which is which matches that.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:32.880
I've always enjoyed the spirit, the rhythm, the enthusiasm of Bhangra, particularly in the carnival context, but in any context.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:39.880
There are also a number of, what shall I say, exclamations and chants that to my mind go with the Bhangra experience.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.880
And now is my chance to finally learn. What exactly does the phrase Haripa mean?

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.880
It's Haripa, I suppose. It's a difficult one.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.880
It's because there's numerous different translations.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.880
Please give us a few.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:01.880
Mine would be, I would assume, I would say it means joy, if you wish, joy.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.880
Any other examples you can give?

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.880
Definitely.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:13.880
Yes, my speech is when you are very jolly and you want to shout out loud that you're having some fun.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.880
Got it.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:24.880
So the Bhangra, when the music actually hits to the rhythm on your feet and the brain, you just want to yell out, I'm having some fun.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:30.880
It's similar as when people are dancing, say, in the Western world and they say, hey, ho.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.880
Got it. It's brilliant.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.880
I mean, again, when you guys are performing, you shout that.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.880
I have a tendency to shout it as well, you know, because it raises the atmosphere, doesn't it?

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.880
Adding on to what my dad said earlier about you bringing Bhangra into Cardiff and what have you.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.880
One thing my dad didn't mention is he actually used to teach as well in schools.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:59.880
So from obviously after my grandfather and what have you, once they passed it on to my dad's generation, my dad then took it into schools.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.880
And it started to get recognised quite a lot more as an instrument.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:10.880
Obviously, going back over 20, 25, 30 years ago, even, you can imagine how many people didn't know what the dhol was.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.880
What's the difference between a dhol and a dholki?

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.880
Dholki is played by hands and that's a very, it's a smaller instrument.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.880
I thought it was a smaller version.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.880
Yeah, it's about half a metre in size.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.880
Got it.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:35.880
And then the schools, it was in the Key Stage 3, which was very important that a lot of people do some sort of, especially in the Asian, there was not a lot of instruments in the Asian.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:36.880
Creative skill.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:46.880
And for the other people to give the opportunity for them to play that instrument as well as all the other instruments.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:53.880
I remember going to see one performance that you taught the children at Nenian Park Junior School.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.880
And it was wonderful.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:08.880
And as you say, there were children of Asian origin, or background there, but there were children, you know, from every shape and size, every creed and colour, and they were all into it so much, which is fantastic.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:15.880
Of course Bhangra, as well as being a music form, is a dance form as well.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:30.880
Can you tell us a little bit about some of the different shapes you pull and some of the, you know, okay, let me say, I've never seen such a wonderful, dramatic, collective dance moves.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.880
I mean, the chariot moves.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:38.880
Give us some insight into the physical fitness required for this and some of the shapes.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.880
Yeah, you most definitely have to be fit and you've described it very, very well.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.880
It's something of a lot of physical demanding moves.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.880
It's very colourful, very bright.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:56.880
A lot of the moves that are displayed in a form of Bhangra dance actually signify the harvest time.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.880
So for example, have you probably seen the sort of snappy sort of stick thing?

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.880
Absolutely.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.880
That's cutting the crops.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.880
So that's actually what they used to do to cut the crops, but we've turned them into moves.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.880
Again, it's signifying, remembering what we've done during this harvest time.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.880
I say we, my ancestors, during the harvest period.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.880
So those sort of moves.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:24.880
And then obviously they've added to more acrobatic style stuff like making pyramids out of 10, 15 people or what have you.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.880
Fantastic.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.880
So that is very colourful, very bright as well.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:36.880
It's always been the intention for Cardiff Cardiff of all to reflect the multicultural nature of Cardiff.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:43.880
And certainly when the Duaul's been beating out its fabulous rhythm, the Bhangra dancers have been there.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:52.880
What kind of reaction can you remember getting from the wider population as you come through the streets or in the city centre?

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.880
Or indeed when we used to stage Cardiff mass carnival as it was down the bay.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.880
What can you remember about what?

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.880
Yes. What was people's reactions like?

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.880
It's a really energetic instrument.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.880
So it definitely brings out the energy in people.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.880
You hear loads of chants, loads of screaming, loads of clapping.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.880
That's the sort of thing, because it's definitely something.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.880
It's not something you walk by.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.880
It's a percussion. It's similar to the steel pans.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.880
It's got so much rhythm in the actual instrument.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.880
It just brings out the energy in you.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.880
When the actual instrument is played, as soon as it's played, the Duaul.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:44.880
And they will stop and listen to it that split second because it's so loud and it's so enjoyable listening to a different instrument.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.880
And they want to learn more to see how it's played.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:52.880
As you mentioned, it was your father who helped bring this wonderful art form to Wales.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:58.880
You then picked up the baton and now we turn to the younger generation, Thiraj.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:10.880
Am I right in thinking that, I mean, let's be honest, just before we start the interview, you have in fact been teaching Duaul today.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:22.880
Yeah. Now, as you mentioned, with the acknowledgement of the instrument and you can even say the genre of music has become very famous.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.880
A lot of people are learning of numerous ethnicities.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:37.880
So I have approximately 12 to 15 students at the moment, ranging from kids that are four and five, that are white, British, Welsh, Muslim, Hindu.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.880
I even have a doctor from Italia that comes from Bristol.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.880
Where are they sourcing the instruments?

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:50.880
I remember at one point, certainly, is it Bina Arts in Southall was a place that people used to go?

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.880
Bina used to be very, very big.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.880
Back in the day, back in the day.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.880
Bina is still there. Jazz is probably the most famous now, jazz musicals.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:09.880
However, as we move into the 21st century and with internet, people are now sourcing direct from the horse's mouth, shall we say.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:14.880
So from India themselves. So we're jazz musicals. We're charging you X amount.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.880
Say, for example, just to use as an example, a hundred pound for a drum.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:22.880
They're now going there and picking them up for 10 percent off the price.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.880
Fantastic. The skins. What are the skins made of?

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.880
The base side, because you've got one heavy duty skin and one thin skin.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.880
The heavy duty one is actually sheepskin.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.880
So obviously you can hit that as hard as you want.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.880
It's not really ripping unless your intention is to.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.880
And then the other side is a thin plastic.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.880
And the sense of tuning the drum. Is that difficult?

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:50.880
Is it obviously, you know, bound with ropes?

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.880
That's exactly it. So originally it was only done with rope.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.880
So both sides was done with rope.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.880
But as we move forward into the 21st century, if you wish, they started to change them to nut and bolt.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.880
So it's a lot more easier to control.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:10.880
Some people do both with nut and bolt, but it's not very common because the base side, you don't get the same sound as doing it with rope.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:16.880
So people have rope on the base side still that you can tighten and loosen after every performance.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.880
And then you've got the nut and bolt to do the treble side.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:32.880
Got it. Got it. I think, you know, obviously one thinks of seeks and seekers and warrior, warrior cast and spirituality.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.880
But also, I have to say a certain sense of entrepreneurship.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.880
I mean, I know John has several businesses.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:48.880
And again, before we started the interview, Raj, you were mentioning that you're well, what can I say?

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:53.880
Collaborating financially and in a business sense with people even farther afield.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:15:00.880
Would you care to just give us a little taste of your business acumen and where you're focused at the moment?

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:09.880
Yes. So following again in my parents' footsteps, I've always been in and around businesses, day off school, weekends, bank holidays.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.880
My dad's taken me to the markets and what have you.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.880
So I've always been streetwise, shall we say.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:25.880
And then following that, I've been lucky enough to be put through education, do my degree, do my masters and what have you, which has then led upon building a few small businesses.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:32.880
Obviously the entertainment company, which I've taken over from my dad and my grandfather, where originally that was just dancers.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:37.880
We now do the full entertainment packages going into wedding event management as well now.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:42.880
Dance floors, DJs, drummers, singers, jazz players, you name it, PA hire.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:51.880
That's the entertainment side of technology company based in China, property companies based in India and in the UK.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.880
So, yeah, loads of little things that's keeping us busy and out of trouble.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:16:03.880
John and Raj, thank you so much for that insight, not mainly into the role of the dole and bungering, part of Carnival,

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:18.880
but some wider insight into Sikhism in Wales and quite clearly we're sitting next to what is going to be, I'm sure, someone who's going to be a future Young Businessman of the Year or Businessman of the Year.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.880
Thank you very much indeed.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:25.880
And well, I hope that those in the future who get to listen to this enjoy it as much as I have.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.880
Thank you very much.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.880
Thank you.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:28.880
Excellent.
