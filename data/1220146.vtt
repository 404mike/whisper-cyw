00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
Can you tell me a little bit about your mum?

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.920
She's always been an old lady. She was 41 when I was born and I've always been her carer

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.480
as far as I can remember. Her proper name was Fajga Jekyll.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.480
Yeah.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.760
Although she was known as Fanny Jekyll.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.760
And she was born around when?

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.760
25th November 1917.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.760
Okay, and where?

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.240
Dolina, Poland as was then.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.280
Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about her life then?

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.320
As far as I know, when she was a baby they moved to Gelsenkirchen, which is near in

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.520
the Westphalen of Germany. She was about two, three I think. She was brought up there and she had

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.840
a brother and two sisters and I think other children but I'm not sure about the other

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.400
children. And then they had a local synagogue not far from where they lived in Gelsenkirchen.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.640
And then war broke out and she escaped a roundup. Her sisters were already in the UK then.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.600
But her brother and parents weren't. She escaped a roundup but eventually she got caught and as

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.960
far as I know she was taken to a labour camp. And I don't know when she was rounded up but she was

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:15.680
taken to a labour camp and worked and they were marching from one place to another and she tripped

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.560
and the guard hit her on the head with his rifle butt and left her for dead and carried on marching.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.600
And apparently a Lutheran priest found her and thought she was also dead but she wasn't and he

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.680
brought her back to, nursed her back to life. All I know is she had an indentation in the inside of

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.160
her arm where she had the tattoo numbers taken away. I mean they wasn't lasered out, they were

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.160
sort of dug out because she had quite a deep hole in her arm. She had a big, big scar in her head

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:55.280
always from the rifle butt where she was hit. She was left injured and somehow this priest

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.840
and the underground got her through and got to the UK and that's as far as I know really.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.120
And how was her health? Always bad, always bad, bad health, always as I said right in the beginning

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:14.640
I've always known her as a ill mother. I've never known her as a healthy mother. She was completely

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.480
deaf, yeah they made her completely deaf and it got worse over the years. Yeah I think in the early

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.560
days she used to wear a hearing aid and she could hear slightly but then even with the hearing aid

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.960
she couldn't hear anymore so she just left it off but and she couldn't hear the English language to

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.120
pronounce it so she spoke to us in German. My father spoke to us in English and we was brought

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.440
up bilingual. You said her sisters got out? Her sisters came out before all hell let loose type

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.440
thing you know and they came over here and they were in service her two sisters because she was

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.320
the younger one. I suppose she was too young to go with them I don't know. She was the younger one

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.320
and yeah they were in service over in London, domestic service. And do you have any information

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.440
about what happened about her parents? Well we found out a couple of years ago that they were taken

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.960
to Latvia and killed in Latvia. So she got out somehow through the underground system? Through

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.960
the underground system she never spoke about it never mentioned it. Where did she end up in the UK

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:22.400
then? In a place in a refugee camp called Kitchener Camp and I think she was there for about 18 months

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.480
two years something like that and that's where she met my dad who was in the forces

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.160
who was a German speaker in the forces that's where they got married in the Kitchener Camp.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.680
Did she talk about her time in the Kitchener Camp? No no never spoke about anything. A lot of this is

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.480
what you've reconstructed. Yeah.
