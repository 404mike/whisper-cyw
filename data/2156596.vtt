00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800
My name is Jill Willey. Today it's the 8th of August and I'm here at the Ellen Lynx offices

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:18.440
talking to Liz Fosse, Ian Billings and Nathan Preece. Now these people are members of a

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:28.960
very interesting organisation known as GOATS, meaning Getting On in the Shed group. My apologies,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.640
Getting On at the Shed. Thank you, Liz. Liz, could you just give us your full name and

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:42.760
the year in which you were born? Liz Fosse, 1952. Fine. Can you tell me just a little

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.280
bit about yourself, as much or as little as you choose to tell me in the next couple of

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.720
minutes? I was born in the Midlands. I was born in Nottingham where I spent almost 30

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.480
years there. Then I moved down to Devon, to Plymouth and I spent almost 30 years there

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.120
and I've come to Birmingham and I'm going to spend 30 years here. Thank you very much

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:13.440
indeed. May I call you Liz? You can, yes. Right, thank you very much. We'll just move

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:22.240
on now to Ian. One moment please. Okay, we'll just pin on to the research. I'll just clip

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:34.200
on. Anywhere at all. No, sorry. Right, and now we're moving on to Nathan. So Nathan,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.160
could you just give us your full name please, the year you were born and just a little snapshot

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:49.960
of yourself. Yes, I'm Nathan Price. I was born in 1946. I'm a retired accountant. I

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.400
was born in Gloucestershire. I lived in West Midlands for about 50 years now I guess. I

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.000
joined the goats about six months ago and enjoyed the company and very much enjoyed

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.360
the trip here today. Well, we're very pleased to welcome the three of you here at the Ellen

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:16.880
Ling's office. Yeah, and that's Don who is a minor. Because I'd heard about the, that they were

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.320
talking about the Valley and where Birmingham water comes from, my friend told me about it and

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.680
I thought, oh that sounds really interesting. And so I came along right at the start, we were

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.680
talking about that. Well, I think some of them had done a bit of a walk of the pipe as well.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:45.360
Yeah, and other things that we do. You obviously do a lot of interesting things. We do local

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.760
history. We've been on little trips around our local area and found out things that we didn't

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:00.280
even know about, you know, on our doorstep. It sounds very interesting what you do and what

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.240
you're doing while you're here in the Valley. Would you mind just tell me a little bit about

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.120
the gentleman you referred to as the Mine of Information? I think I had a technical blip there.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:18.040
Oh, what was his name? His name's Don and he's well into his eighties I think. Mine of Information,

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:25.560
if we ask a question he always knows the answer and if he doesn't he goes back,

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.840
researches it and comes back and tells us all what he's learnt. He sounds like a very useful

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:40.920
gentleman. He's very useful, very interesting man. Fine, fine. I'll move on to Ian now if I may.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:49.440
Hello. Hello Ian, we talk again. Right, is this your first time in the Ellen Valley?

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:56.320
It is my first time here, yes, in the Ellen Valley. I've travelled quite a lot in Wales

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:09.520
because I used to work across Wales and but yes, it's my first time in the Ellen Valley.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.120
And what do you think of it? Have you had a pleasant experience?

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:22.320
It's been absolutely beautiful. We've been very lucky with the weather, not just because it's

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.840
been hot and sunny but because it's been so bright and the landscape has looked very beautiful.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.960
We're familiar with the layout of the valley from the model in Cannon Hill Park but you don't get

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:46.240
a sense of the scale and quite how pretty it is until you're walking and driving around it.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:56.000
Right, we might just move on to Nathan now. So nice to hear that you're really enjoying

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.120
yourselves here. Nathan, we've just discussed the water and the model. I take it you yourself were

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.640
aware of where your water came from in Birmingham? Oh yes, yes, I knew it came from the Ellen Valley,

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:18.800
yes. Right, and have you actually seen the model? I have, only fairly recently, it's only after I

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.880
joined GOAPS where people were starting to talk about it that I realised it was there. I hadn't

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.680
lived really right in Birmingham, well I'd lived in Birmingham itself for about 10 years now but

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.840
I never actually knew it was there and I did go and find it and yeah it's very interesting.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.600
It's quite a little gem in the middle of the Cannon Hill Park isn't it?

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.600
Yes it is. Right, thank you. We'll move back to Liz now, many thanks.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:57.920
Liz you've given me a little snapshot of what goes on at GOAPS. Now is this your first time in the

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:05.760
valley? I'm not sure how far away it was that I've been before but it was definitely Central Wales

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:13.040
and I'm going to say this wrong, it was Clanddilos, something like that. Clidloes, I would imagine.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.880
Yes, is that too far away from here? No it is not, it's just in fact people commute so it's really

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:26.080
not that far at all. Well I came here in 1976 when there was a drought so I've seen all the

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:34.400
reservoirs, never seen a reservoir full and the weather was just like this, so my vision of Wales

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:48.880
is always sunny. Sunny, yes. Not always of course but you've obviously come. And I have to say that probably my son was conceived in Wales

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.560
so if we gave him a name it would be Aberystwyth.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.080
Can you put that one off? Take that one out.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:11.200
Whatever you like. Right and Liz were you well aware of the fact that the water here goes down to

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.960
Birmingham? Were you aware that was your supply? Not until I came to Birmingham and since I've been

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:24.000
at Goats I've talked about it with my friends and they all learned about the Elan Valley and

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.000
the water at school and they made models of it, they all went to visit it as a school trip

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:38.320
so they all knew exactly what I was talking about. Right so you're well aware of this model in

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:48.880
Mill Park. Yes. I see. Right thank you. Ian then is there anything else you'd like to say about

00:07:48.880 --> 00:08:00.320
what you do at Goats at all? Yes you were right when you said earlier it was set up as a group for

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:07.440
men. I think the original idea had been that there was a possible problem of isolation

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:21.360
in older men and I'm 53 and the youngest goat but when I joined it was a lot more of a men's group

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:30.720
and we did some very manly activities. We made nails for example in a forge which is a traditional

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:38.560
Birmingham industry or a traditional black country industry I should say and we learned scything from

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:45.200
Ida who's with us on this trip and which I can't describe as a manly activity since Ida is a woman

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:53.040
who was teaching us to be experts. So we've done quite a lot of sort of conservation focused things

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:03.120
there's an orchard associated with the shed and some people work there and yes it's been

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:11.840
local history and industrial history has been a focus but we've also done some craft type things

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:18.080
and so on chorus oh yes some nature-based nature focused things as well.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:29.040
Absolutely lovely what you do lovely camaraderie I would imagine. We've also done some singing

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:40.560
because Kate Green who as you know was artist in residence here had written two songs which our

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:50.560
group one member of our group wrote melodies a four-part vocal harmony and guitar line and a

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:58.560
piano part and then we recorded those songs and one of our number who you might interview later

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:06.640
wrote some goats lyrics so we added some extra verses of our own and we sang them we sent the

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:13.200
recording to Kate and she joined us last night and we had a little sing of her version and our

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.920
version and played around with some musical instruments so there's a some of the goats are

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:23.840
musical. So really your talents are quite legion aren't they they appear to be? Collectively yes

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:29.520
not necessarily individually. What was the name of the song because Kate Green has actually given

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:35.280
a performance of all her songs walking the pipeline what was the name of your song? There were two

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:43.120
there was walking the pipe and the other one was called 73 and a half miles. Right thank you thank

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:49.120
you very much. So Ian I take it you're aware that Birmingham is supplied by the water from the

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.640
Elan Valley? Well yes but I wasn't at school in Birmingham so I hadn't learned that at school or

00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:04.720
made models at school but I was born in Crewe and my dad always told me water came from Wales

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:11.920
and I don't know if cruise water comes from the Elan Valley or not but

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:18.720
it certainly comes from somewhere in Wales. I see and you'd be aware of the model in Cannon Hill Park?

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:24.720
In Cannon Hill Park yes yes and I believe that it was in working condition when I first came to

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.520
Birmingham it's in need of some restoration at the moment and I believe there's a project

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:38.160
underway or under discussion to renovate it and get it back up to a working model with water

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:44.240
flowing through it. Well let's hope that comes to fruition in the not too distant future then.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:52.960
Thank you very much Ian. Nathan if I can just ask you now is there anything you'd like to add to the

00:11:52.960 --> 00:12:00.320
activities that you all do in the goats? I think to be honest about 90 percent of the time we

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:06.160
spend drinking coffee and just having a chat and catching up on what's been happening

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:15.840
and we sort of plan trips and events so it's just having a chat and

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.520
planning forward events coming here. I mean it's been a lot of discussion about coming here obviously

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:29.280
so yeah but it's just nice to have an hour or two a week just meeting up with my old friends.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:36.160
And is this your first time in the Elan Valley? Well to be honest I thought I'd been here before

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:41.600
but now I've come and seen it I don't think I have so I would say it was my first yeah I must

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:47.680
have been somewhere else I was thinking of which was in Wales. And what do you think of it then?

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:54.160
Oh it's absolutely stunning yeah really beautiful and I guess it's maybe larger than I expected the

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:59.840
whole area probably probably larger than I expected. Yes and of course now you'll be aware of it

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:06.080
you probably have a better idea of its links now with this area supplying the water and

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.840
you're obviously aware of that little model in the can. Yes that's right yeah yeah yeah it's sort of

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:17.600
put it all together now. Well one question I'd like to ask you collectively if I may and that's

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:25.680
will you come again? Yes I will have you come again. Yes probably yes yes I would bring my family.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:32.720
Thank you. Well I think we've more or less covered it about what you've been doing and where you've

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:38.640
been and how much you like it and we've established a connection between Birmingham and

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:44.320
Elan Valley now so thank you very very much. So you've talked about the games games oh we haven't

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:50.160
mentioned yet. Right there's a little bit more I think Liz would like to say.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:14:01.920
One of our group Hugh asked if we'd like to do board games and people bring board games along

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:08.560
and we're all introduced to new games and yeah it can be quite competitive sometimes.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:15.200
Yeah would you say it's a it's a very good way of getting to know people and the camaraderie.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.600
Definitely yeah. Keeping you together. Yeah yeah a lot of us are on our own

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:26.560
um so you know that's good for an ideal place to meet. Especially after lockdown you know you

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:32.960
sort of. We're all coming out again now aren't we? Yes well look that's lovely I think that more or

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:41.520
less sums it up and thank you very much Liz, Ian and Nathan for your time and your input. Thank you.
