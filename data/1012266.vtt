00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Where were you born? Born in Liverpool, 1939, just before the war, on the January before the war.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Do you know Bootle? Yes, I mean that's one of the things that I suppose Thomas and I got on so well.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
He was a Bootle lad and I was a Liverpool lad, although he was much more of a scouser than I was in a sense.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I grew up in the posh part of Liverpool, they would say, in Mosley Hill.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:37.000
My parents were doctors. My father was a GP in Mosley Hill and Allerton for maybe 30 years before he retired with ill health.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So I came from a medical family. They were Glasgow graduates and came to Liverpool.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So yes, Liverpool is my hometown. I did a degree in civil engineering at the university there.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And my first job was with Robert McAlpine. Met the personnel officer and he says, when do you want to start?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I said, oh well, I'll be there in a holiday, September will be alright. Fine, he said.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And he sent me off to Newport, South Wales, where they were part of a huge construction team building the Clanwerne Steelworks.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Richard Thomas and Baldwin, as it was in those days. It was a massive, massive thing.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And I spent most of the time setting out the concrete bases for the huge steel rolling mills and the steelmaking plants.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And the whole lot was piled. They had to raise the level of the ground there by about six feet.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It was all marshlands. And there'll be lorries coming down from the Welsh valleys day and night with shale and gravel and stuff to raise the level to make it possible to put piling in.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And he said that you could run a road from Newport to London with the amount of stuff that they brought down from the valleys. Huge amount.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Anyway, I was there in September and I left, I think that was in 1960 after I graduated.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:29.000
That's in 1960. And then stayed there until, I think it was July-ish, 1962.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And the job was coming to the inclusion and I was transferred as part of my career development to go into the design office in Carpines having spent my first 18 months out on site, which is a wonderful experience for me.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I learnt a lot about the world and life and so on.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And being part of a team as well, I suppose.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Well, yes. The Chippies as we used to call them, the Labourers. We're all part of a team and I always thought we were all equally important.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I couldn't get on with my job until they did theirs and they couldn't get on with the job until I had done mine as the engineer.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And then I moved up to Cheshire, to Nutsford, to the Carpines base there with the nuclear power group and we were designing nuclear power stations.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
My first job was with the Dungeness A, as it's now called, down at Lyd in Kent.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And we once flew a few of us down from Manchester to the Lyd airport to see how the construction was going.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And then Dungeness moved on to the old Beyond 7 one. That was the first of the advanced gas cool reactors, AGR, a pre-stressed concrete pressure vessel.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And I remember designing a pump house for that.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And so I was based in Nutsford, but that was the very cold winds of 62, 63.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And I was in Diggs in Nutsford with a little lady and another bloke.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And it was freezing cold. I used to wear my duffle coat in bed at night. No double glazer or anything like that, a little old cottage.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Well, my home was still in Liverpool and I decided that having bought my little mini car in Newport, S69BAX, little white cream mini,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and so I decided I would see if I could travel from Liverpool each day to Nutsford.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And soon I found there were two other fellows also travelling from Liverpool.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
We used to meet up and take turns in driving from Liverpool to Nutsford each day.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
How long did that take?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
About three quarters to an hour.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Oh, that's not too bad.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:54.000
The new bridge, well, it's now the old bridge, of course, was opened, you see. That was the arch bridge.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
You know they've opened a new bridge, the gateway, which is a suspension bridge.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Well, so you could do it and travelling through the countryside.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And so I lived at home again and that's why I think back of the church.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And that's all part of the story.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Going back to the first arriving in Newport, I was brought up in the Presbyterian Church of England Church in Liverpool

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
when I was baptised and grew up, confirmed and became a member.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And so, you know, church was at least twice a Sunday, church in the morning, Sunday school in the afternoon.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And in those days, being very Scottish in the family, from a young age I used to wear the kilt every Sunday.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
That was my Sunday best.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And once I came to Newport, I thought I'd look out for a Presbyterian Church.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And catching a bus from Newport town out to where we were living in the McAlpine area,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
out to where we were living in the McAlpine's hostels at Pie Corner,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
was a huge accommodation place for everybody there.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
You know, sort of temporary accommodation hut after hut after hut.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Not huts, what do you call them, I don't know.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Anyway, you had your own room and there were showers and the canteen and things like that.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
You were fed and watered.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And on the road coming out of Newport to Pie Corner, along Corporation Road, I saw this sign,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Welsh Presbyterian Church.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000
I thought, well, it was English speaking, I think, which is important.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000
So I think probably the following Sunday or so, I must have got a lift or a bus in

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and went to the evening service on the Sunday.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
I was a bit sort of non-plus because it was all ladies doing everything.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
I thought it was a bit strange, never had ladies doing everything in the church before.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
See, you're going back a long time when ladies didn't do much in the church on a Sunday.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Anyway, they were very warm and welcoming and so I went again the following Sunday

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
and met Cyril Somers and that's where it all started.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And Brian says I did, or Valerie says I did quite a lot in the church,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I can't remember what else I did.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Whether it was a choir or not, I used to be in the choir in the church in Liverpool,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
so I always loved singing, still do.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
So whether they had a choir, I can't remember.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
But I wouldn't have had time to do much else, you see,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
because I used to work five and a half days a week.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Saturday was a normal day and then there was overtime, Saturday afternoons and Sundays as well,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
which is quite important because I was saving up for a car, you see.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And eventually I was able to, the bank manager, my father knew a bank manager,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.000
took out an insurance policy and that was the security for getting a loan for a to-buy car.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Anyway, so there we were and I had a very warm welcome.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Met the Selby family, the Martin family, all sorts of people.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000
It was a lovely community group, very family orientated, I think.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And that was when the old church was still standing?

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Oh, yes, this is 1960, 1961 to 1962.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So eventually I was moving away back up to Nubsford, you see,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
said my farewells and I sort of must have kept in touch,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Christmas cards or something with Syl and Dorothy, wasn't it?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Dorothy.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Dorothy, very bubbly character she was.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
I can still hear her laugh or chuckle with it.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
She was lovely.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And then things started to happen.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
When I was in Nubsford and living back at home, joined up with the church again,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
I was invited to join the old FLY, the Fellish for Youth, the youth group,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
which met on a Sunday night.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Of course, when I went to, I should have said that, to Newport,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
I suppose I did stand out because I went to my Sunday best.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
I wore my kilt on a Sunday.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Well, not many Scotsmen wear a kilt in Newport, I'll tell you.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And maybe they thought, here's this funny Scotsman who comes to church

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and they're killed on a Sunday in a Welsh Presbyterian church.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
So there you are.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Perhaps they thought me a bit different, obviously, but I'm a tall fellow.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
I'm sort of six foot three in those days as well as I stood out.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
But that was part of me.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Anyway, having joined up in the church in Liverpool again, in Alersan,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I was asked one time to help out an Anglican church not far away,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
leading their young people on a weekend conference.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
About four or five of us went along just to assist.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
At the end of this conference, we were asked,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
will somebody give a testimony about their faith?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
We all looked at each other and they looked at me and said,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Angus, you can do it.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
I thought, well, help, having done it in my life before.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
You know, not just what do you believe, why do you believe it, isn't it?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And so I can't remember what I said, but I struggled through.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And that was, it must have been in October.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And in the October, the minister of the church, Hal Springbott,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:50.000
gave the annual notice about the need for ministers to train at Westminster College.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And if anybody wants ever to think about it, have a talk with me.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Well, I was sitting in the choir stalls and a little voice seemed to say to me,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
how about you, Angus?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And that little thought wouldn't go away.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So I had a word with my minister and said, what's involved?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
I don't know whether I want to do this or what's involved.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And he told me, and come November,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
the youth group were taking the evening service and had to plan it

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
and who's going to do the talk or the sermon?

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Who he looked at and I said, well, I'll have a go.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And I thought as a test that if I could do this, then maybe that's not saying something to me.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Because by this time I had sort of said, well, God, if my life is yours, what do you want me to do?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And so I did it and the minister had looked at it beforehand, made one or two suggestions,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
and I got through it, giving my first sermon in my kilt, of course,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
which I have done one since.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And it all happened.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
So I felt, yeah, OK.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
So then I, it was a step of faith.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
If God wants me to be a minister, then the doors will open.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
If he doesn't, the doors won't open, will they?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
That's what a step of faith is about.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
You've got to go for it and see what happens.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And I went for interviews and got past those, had to go to London, got past those.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And lo and behold, this was 1963 by now,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:39.000
I found myself doing an entrance exam in Westminster College, and a week later I found out I'd passed.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Now, so that's when my training started in Cambridge for three years.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Meanwhile, back in Liverpool, having met up with a youth group, there was a young lady called Althea Jones,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
whom I used to know in the Sunday school days when she'd been about five or six,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
and I'd be three years old, eight or nine, something like that.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
She had long black hair and pigtails.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
I had two friends, Jean and Joan.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And eventually she invited me to join the FOI when I came back to Liverpool.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And within a year or so we sort of had met,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:27.000
and obviously been on a few outings with young people, and we fell in love.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
And that's the history.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
We had a golden wedding maybe three years ago.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
It is 53 years this year.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Congratulations.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And so it was 1963.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
I must have had some sort of letter from Cyril Somers saying,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
The problem was the church building, the tower was subsiding, I think it was.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
The nations were giving way and it was going to have to be demolished.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And they were planning to have an international voluntary work camp to start a rebuild scheme,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
but they needed to prepare stuff, the ground works for it.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Would I possibly be able to come and be work leader, if you like, with my engineering experience?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
And I said, Well, if this is what God wants me to do, I'll have a go.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And I went to the senior engineer working in Nutsford and Central.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Is it possible to be away for a month doing this project for a church in Newport where we used to work with McAlpine's then?

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
And he said, Yes, but it would be unpaid leave.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
No, you can't get paid for being away for a month.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
You're used up on your holiday.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
I came down and I was fed and watered for a month.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
I think I stayed in the cell, I think so.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:06.000
This time, Alfie and I were engaged and she came down one weekend and met Cyril and Dorothy and the family.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
It was only just for a weekend.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
We can't remember if we got any photographs because we didn't do many in those days.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
I've got a few of the steelworks I took, but they're all transparencies anyway.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Oh, yeah, they'll be quite difficult to view.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Where they are now, I've no idea.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Oh, so that's interesting because I got the impression that you were at the time working on the Flanwerne Steelworks.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
No, no, I've gone by them.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
No, you've not been up there at all.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Sir Robert McAlpine, yes.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
They're still doing very good firms.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Yes, they are.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:46.000
In fact, they're doing a big job in Cardiff for the new central hub, is it, for the assembly.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
I looked up their website yesterday.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Oh, they did the Olympic Park.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Within budget and on time.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
They all did the arse on the Emirates Stadium.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
It's a well-known firm.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000
So I was pleased.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
When I left them, I gave my notice and I was going to train for college.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
I asked the old manager, went, a nice sort of memo said,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
we think we could have made you into a good engineer.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
But he was interesting because when he realised what I was doing to train for the church,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
she said, well, and he was a crusader leader.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Are there crusaders?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Not really.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Well, it's work amongst young people.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
It's basic.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:33.000
No, it's not an Anglican group, but it's a very evangelical group working with young people.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000
I don't know how well it's going these days now, but it was quite a strong group in gospel when it was there.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
So there we are.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
We came down and worked for a month and it was amazing.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
I don't really have a record of all the people who came from around the world.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Oh, yes, we have and we've tried to contact them through various means.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
The only people that we know...

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
They were from the United States, India.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
I think there's a Hebrew girl from Israel.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
There was Swiss, Swedish, I think there was English and Welsh.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
I think it was a Scots girl and incredible.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:17.000
I think we'd gather at eight o'clock in the morning, prayers outdoors because there's nowhere to stay for that.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.000
And they worked from eight o'clock till about midday, have lunch somewhere,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
and then they have the afternoon off to go and visit and so on.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:37.000
At that time I was of going to retire and have to read in preparation for my entrance exam at Westminster College in Cambridge,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
trying to read philosophy of religion.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
I couldn't make head or tail of it.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
I was an engineer, you know, this is all new to me, different language.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000
At any point did you think, am I really doing the right thing or you didn't feel...

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
No, you just had this faith that this is the right path for you.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Well, if God wanted me to do it, he would open the doors.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
But what I found out for the entrance exam, I had to do New Testament Greek.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000
That sort of... I mean, the minister helped me a lot.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000
And because I was an engineer, you do a lot of maths.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000
And so I knew the Greek alphabet from alpha to omega because it's all in substitution, isn't it, maths?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
X, Y, Z, and alpha to omega.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:31.000
And I'd done that in school, so the grammar of New Testament Greek and Latin are very, very similar.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000
So it wasn't too hard to pick up, it's just the vocabulary and all the verbs and nouns.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000
So I passed it somehow, but then I also had to do Hebrew at college, and that really was a struggle.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
You spend hours getting very little away.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.000
And for the first year I sort of floundered because to move from a scientific engineering background

00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:01.000
into a theological, philosophical, language-orientated and all that was really strange.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000
And it took me a year to begin to fit things together, as well as a lot of Bible studies.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
And history, I hadn't done history. I failed my history exam the first year

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
because I thought, history, we'll just read it and it'll all come back to you. No, it doesn't.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
So my first summer holidays I had to work hard.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Meantime, my parents had moved up to Scotland, so I had no base in Liverpool.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:33.000
And my Alfea parents took me in as a lodger.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
So I lived with my fiancé for two years in those days.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Very risky, isn't it?

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
And while you were at college, you weren't permitted to get married, you see.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
That was the rule at the time.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.000
But by two years later, the General Assembly, the Presbyterian Church, changed the rules.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
You get married while you're in study with the permission of your minister,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
the principal of the college and the moderator of the General Assembly.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Of course you can, yes.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
The principal said, yes, Alan McLeod is a lovely Liverpool man.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
And the moderator came to see me and interview me quite so seriously.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Do I really understand what you're doing?

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Well, I was 26 by this time.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
So we got married in 1965 now.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
I finished the course at Cambridge in 1966.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000
So, meantime, back in Newport, all these wonderful young people,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.000
it wasn't all plain sailing because, you know, there were group dynamics.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
How many were on it? About 15, 20?

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Something like that. I've got a list of them.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Yeah, something like that.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Well, you know, jelling that together of all different backgrounds and cultures was quite something.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.000
And, you know, hats off when you look back to Cyril and Dorothy for helping it happen the way it did.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000
And what I'll never, you know, the poor things had to be scraping the mortar off bricks, cleaning bricks.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
That was our major job.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
So dirty and hard.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
And that was almost soul-destroying.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
I think the weather for that month was quite good somehow looking back.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Not too bad. There were some lovely mornings.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:23.000
But my sort of wonderful memory, which never left me and influenced my thinking,

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:31.000
that on the very last morning, Cyril arranged for a sharing of communion outside in the open air,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
in the round, with all these young people.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
And they all took part, as far as I can remember, the Roman Catholics and even this Israeli girl who was, you know,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Hebrew, all took part in the sharing the bread and the wine.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:50.000
And, you know, that image has never left me that this is how the church and the world should be,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
sharing together in harmony and peace and in love for one another.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
And if you can do it here, why can't they do it elsewhere?

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:05.000
And I've always been so sort of disappointed in the way people look back at this is our tradition,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
and we can't possibly change this, do that.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000
And oh, so far from how I see what Jesus wanted things to be.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:21.000
But that for me was an insight which has never left me all my life in church life, the ecumenical scene.
