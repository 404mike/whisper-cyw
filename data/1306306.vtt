00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is chapter 20 in our series in relation to race riots and relates the Red Summer of 1919.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Race riots, brutality, the deaths of black people under attack by white mobs across the United States in 1919.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
There was a brutal swathe of racial violence leading to hundreds of black people being shot, lynched and burned to death.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The story is told here by The History Guy, which is a superb American YouTube site that you should subscribe to.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If we must die, let it not be like hogs hunted and pinned in this inglorious spot,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
while round us bark the mad and angry dogs making their mock of our accursed lot.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Like men we will face the murderous cowardly pack pressed to the wall, dying.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But fighting back.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Claude McKay wrote the poem If We Must Die after a series of attacks against black Americans in the United States in the summer of 1919.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Author James Weldon Johnson coined the term Red Summer to describe those events.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000
A century ago, hundreds of black Americans were killed in attacks all across the country, and yet the nation has built few memorials to those dead.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The Red Summer of 1919 deserves to be remembered.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
1919 was somewhat of a turning point for the United States.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The First World War ended in November 1918. Veterans returned to America, that was rapidly changing.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Women would soon gain the right to vote, and Prohibition would begin an experiment in banning alcohol.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The Army during the First World War was segregated, and some black regiments were put under French command

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
because white American officers were not comfortable commanding black troops.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Many white Americans blamed the coming tragedy on the French for treating black soldiers as equals and planting ideas in their heads.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Called Soldiers of Democracy, black veterans came back to the United States ready to demand civil rights.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
W.E.B. DuBois wrote We Return, We Return from Fighting, We Return Fighting.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.000
For black Americans, 1919 marked 300 years since the first African slaves were brought to the American colonies, and they had begun to start calling for change.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
1919 was a time of anxiety in the United States and the world.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The First World War had ended, but other social movements and economic conditions contributed to an anxious time.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Inflation was rising, labor strikes were common. In Russia, the Bolsheviks had overthrown the Tsar.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Americans feared Bolshevik agitation might come to their shores.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Anarchist bombings were common. The economy was in flux, and in northern cities, white residents were afraid of the new black migrants bringing economic competition.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The Great Migration would eventually send millions of black Americans to the industrial north and midwest, fleeing violence, segregation, and lack of economic opportunity in the south.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Unfortunately, they were sometimes greeted with the same in places where they relocated.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
While they were at first unconcerned, southern employers eventually worried about the loss of cheap labor or to stem the tide of the exodus.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.000
From spring into fall of 1919, these tensions exploded into a series of violent episodes that killed hundreds of black Americans.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.000
It served as a wake-up call, but it also spurred a movement in which blacks in America fought back, sometimes for the first time.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
An early episode of violence occurred in Jenkins County, Georgia, in April.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
A black church party was interrupted when two white officers arrested a black man named Edmund Scott for possession of a pistol.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
A wealthy black farmer named Joe Ruffin offered to pay his fine, but the officers demanded cash instead of a check.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000
When Ruffin tried to pull Scott to the car, an officer struck Ruffin with his pistol, which discharged, knocking Ruffin unconscious.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Ruffin's son, an Army veteran thinking his father was dead, shot and killed one of the officers in retaliation.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
In the ensuing gunfight, the second officer was wounded and then beaten to death.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
As news spread, what was described as hundreds of white men rushed to the town, bent on revenge.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Joe surrendered to the local sheriff, who protected him from a mob bent on lynching.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
But the mob caught and lynched two of his sons, as well as another black man who had been in the area.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
They also burned the church and six other black churches, as well as three black Masonic lodges in the area.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Ruffin was led to another county by the sheriff and put in jail there.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Repeated attempts to try him for murder or manslaughter finally failed, but he was left impoverished from his legal expenses.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
He moved to South Carolinas, who would not have been safe in Georgia.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
No charges were ever filed against any of the men who killed Ruffin's sons or destroyed property.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
On July 19th, in Washington, D.C., a white woman was jostled on the street by two black men.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
One of the men was questioned by police and released, but a rumor started among some white Army veterans that the man had committed rape.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
A white mob started a four-day riot, attacking and beating hundreds of black individuals and damaging businesses.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
When the city's police refused to intervene, black Americans fought back and defended their neighborhoods with firearms.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
There were shootings and attacks from both sides, as President Woodrow Wilson finally sent 200 Army troops to intervene,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
although heavy summer rains may have done more to quell the riot than the troops.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
When it finally ended July 25th, as many as 40 people had died from gunshot wounds or in street fights.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
At least 150 were injured.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
In Chicago, Illinois, a week-long riot was set off on July 27th when a black teenager named Eugene Williams,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.000
hanging onto a makeshift raft, unknowingly floated into the white part of an unofficially segregated Southside Beach on Lake Michigan.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
A white man threw rocks at Williams and other black swimmers to drive them away.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Williams was hit in the forehead, knocking him into the water, where he drowned.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
When black witnesses tried to get the man who threw the rock arrested, the police did nothing.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And when the bystanders complained, a fight broke out between white and black mobs, and spread into five days of general rioting.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:07.000
While there was violence on both sides, the vast majority of the acts of murder, arson, and property damage were perpetrated by white gangs against black residents on Chicago's Southside.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Police did little to protect the black neighborhoods, and the state's attorney accused the police of arresting African-American rioters

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
while refusing to arrest white rioters. Illinois was forced to call in the militia to restore order.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Twenty-three black and fifteen white residents were killed in the rioting. Five hundred more were injured.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
More than a thousand black families were left homeless due to arson.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
The black men who fought back in D.C. and Chicago were often returning veterans of the First World War.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
They had military training, were ready to defend themselves and their families.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
It marked a difference from riots of previous years when blacks were attacked and mostly could not or did not defend themselves.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
The violence made one veteran, Harry Haywood, say he realized,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I had been fighting the wrong war. The Germans weren't the enemy. The enemy was right here at home.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Economic tensions also impacted events at a riot in Omaha, Nebraska at the end of September.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Two years previous to the riot, a local meatpacking plant had brought in black workers as strikebreakers,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and that had caused tension between them and white working class people of the town.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.000
When a black man was accused of raping a white woman, a mob of as many as ten thousand descended on the courthouse,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
demanding the police turn over the man. The mob set fire to the courthouse and captured and tried to hang the mayor.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
They also destroyed private property, attacking black neighborhoods and stores.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Eventually the police, surrounded in the burning building, had no choice but to hand the man, named Will Brown, to the mob,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000
who lynched him and burned his body. A young Henry Fonda witnessed the lynching and said it had a profound effect on him.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Federal troops finally quelled the riot. 120 people were arrested for their involvement,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
but most were never successfully prosecuted and all were eventually released without serving prison sentences.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
The deadliest episode in the Red Summer started September 30th in Elaine, Arkansas.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000
A union of black sharecroppers was meeting with farmers to discuss how to obtain fairer settlements from white landowners,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
who they argued had been exploiting the farmers.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
The planters did not want to pay higher wages and rumors insinuated that communists were behind the unrest,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
reflecting larger tensions in the United States as many Americans feared the Russian Revolution was coming to their shores.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
When two armed white deputies showed up at the meeting, they clashed with armed union guards.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
It's never been determined who shot first, but a white deputy was killed.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
The local sheriff called for a posse to arrest those responsible for the killing.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Spurred by rumors and sensational headlines about a planned insurrection,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
a mob of over a thousand white men descended on the county, indiscriminately killing black men, women, and children.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Estimates vary, but between 100 to more than 500 black people were murdered by the mob.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.000
The governor called in federal troops, who disarmed both sides, but arrested and held 285 black residents.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
The governor established a committee of prominent white residents who,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
without interviewing any of the sharecroppers, concluded that the riot was caused by socialist agitators.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Despite the widespread murders of black residents, an all-white grand jury indicted no white people

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
and instead indicted 122 black men in connection with the riot.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Arkansas had used poll taxes to disenfranchise most black voters,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
thus removing them from the jury pool, and the black men were tried by all-white juries,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
often accused with evidence from witnesses who were coerced.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
In trials where armed white mobs were outside, and sometimes even inside, the courtroom.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Twelve men, called the Arkansas Twelve, were convicted of murder, sentenced to death.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Eventually, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated six of those convictions on the grounds that the mob atmosphere

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and coerced testimony denied the men due process.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
The other six were given indefinite furloughs by outgoing Governor Thomas McCray

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
and taken out of state to prevent their execution.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Most modern researchers discount the assertion that there was a planned insurrection

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
or any plan to target white planters for murder,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
but a conference held in 2000 to review the facts of the event

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
found that the claim appears to be still widely believed.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
While these represent a few of the more violent events of the Red Summer,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:07.000
they are just a few of the more than 25 riots, massacres, and lynchings

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
that occurred across the United States in the late spring into the fall of 1919.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
In the aftermath of the Red Summer, Dr. George Haynes, a sociologist employed by the Wilson Administration,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
published a report in the New York Times and other newspapers.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
It was a call to action about the epidemic of lynchings.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
The report concluded that from 1889 to 1918,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
more than 3,000 black people had been lynched in the United States.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
The report highlighted that states rarely prosecuted the perpetrators of the lynchings

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and showed little motivation to address the problem of lynchings.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
He warned that unchecked mob violence creates hatred and intolerance,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
making impossible, free, and dispassionate discussion not only of race problems,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
but questions on which races and sections differ.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
In such a state of mind, Dr. Haynes wrote,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
a trivial incident can precipitate a riot.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Haynes' report largely fell on deaf ears.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
The government and news media largely attempted to frame black resistance

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
to the violence of the Red Summer as derived from socialist agitators.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
The government provided evidence to the media to support his assertion

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
that political organizations were urging blacks to embrace communism.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
They said that unions were spreading propaganda to breed racial hatred

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and accused W.E.B. Dubois of editorializing about socialism.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Others, including future FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
blamed black radicals while ignoring white perpetrators of violence.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Black newspapers like the Chicago Defender told a different story.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Journalists like Ida B. Wells investigated the attacks

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and got the story out that blacks were sometimes justified in fighting.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
There was some progress.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
The Supreme Court decision in Moore v. Dempsey,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
which effectively freed the Arkansas 12,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
represented a significant shift in policy towards a wider use

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
of federal writs of habeas corpus to oversee state court convictions

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
and represented stricter scrutiny by the Supreme Court

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
of state criminal trials in terms of their compliance with the Bill of Rights.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
But the largest effect of the violence of the Red Summer was on the black community.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Throughout the Red Summer, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
had been contacting government officials to raise the alarm,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
but they were mostly met with indifference, sometimes outright hostility.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
The NAACP had been formed after the 1908 Springfield, Illinois race riot.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
In those days, it was led by prominent white supporters of black civil rights.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
After the Red Summer, black Americans emerged as the leaders of the NAACP

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
and began directing the legal and political advocacy

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
that would lead to success in the civil rights movement in the mid-20th century.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:42.000
By the early 1920s, membership had increased to 100,000 from just 9,000 before the First World War.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
A hundred years later, the nation is still trying to come to grips with the events of the Red Summer.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
The violence is largely forgotten even in communities where it occurred.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
People have been afraid to bring it up for fear that it would raise new tensions,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
or maybe just because they didn't want to face the past.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Chicago is hosting a number of historical events this summer

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
to help the city remember this nearly forgotten chapter in its history.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And for the first time, a hundred years later, a memorial is being built

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000
to the victims of the Elaine Arkansas massacre, though not in Elaine, in nearby West Helena.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
In April, a willow tree was planted in Elaine to memorialize those victims.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And in August, in the night, someone came and chopped it down,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
a sign that not everybody wants to remember the past.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
There are very few historical markers to the violence of the Red Summer in the United States.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:36.000
To most Americans, it is just forgotten history, even though it was the beginning of an awakening.
