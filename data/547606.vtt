00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.400
To come his altar call,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.200
And so the strength of Jesse's rod,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.600
And crown him, crown him, crown him,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.600
Crown him, crown him, crown him,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.200
Crown him, crown him, crown him,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.600
Lord of all.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.600
And in the willow, where thy fire,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.800
A green grassland green,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.400
And in the red, thy will,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.000
Come, come, thy frist,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.200
Rosary of him,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.400
I can, I can, I can,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.600
Come, come, I can,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.200
I can, I can, I can,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.400
Heal him.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.400
O hail the power of Jesus' name,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:28.000
Let angels cross and fall,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.600
In throes the royal joy of death,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.000
And crown him, crown him, crown him,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:50.200
Crown him!
