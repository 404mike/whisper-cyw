WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.840
Okay, so we're recording now. It is Wednesday the 2nd of December 2020 and at 11 o'clock

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.600
in the morning. My name is Paul Hunt and what's your name?

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.080
Dawn Gareth. And where are you today Dawn?

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.800
In my flat in Newport. Newport. And so just to start with, can you

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.000
just say a little bit about who you live with and where you live?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:50.840
Hello, I'm my own in Newport. I work for Carderpeet First. I'm going to talk to houses, very

00:00:51.320 --> 00:01:04.680
uh, bosses for the houses because of the health passport. The health passport is the name

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.160
what you're known as, your date of birth and all stuff like that.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.000
So that's the stuff you do for work, is it? Yes. And do you have a partner at the moment?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:29.880
Yes, I do. But he's not with me today. His name is George Lanton. We are engaged. We've

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:42.680
been engaged since my birthday last year. We've been together for five years.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:53.720
Oh, quite a long time then. Yeah. So I guess I think that I've been with you since about whatever.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.600
So mention, I suppose, the fact that you were one of the first people we interviewed at the

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:19.880
start of all of this. Yes. And so I suppose we'll make reference to that at the start,

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:28.440
but can you tell me, were you shielding at all or not when we had the first lockdown? Yes and no.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:38.040
Answer that question correctly. Let me, yes and let me know. The reason because I live on my own.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:49.400
Yeah. And I got to go down to the shop. I got to go see my sister, but I kept my two meters from her

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:57.000
and they go in and out at all. But then I came straight back to my house. And I was like,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.720
go straight back to my flat. Okay. So back in March and all of this kicked off, how did you feel?

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:21.800
When all of this kicked off, I felt nervous and anxious and all stuff like that at first. Then it

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:31.080
felt okay. Doing online stuff and all. I'm glad we got the tablet for work,

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.400
but I'm using my phone, but nevermind that.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:49.560
As well as that, I did miss George not being with me for the first lockdown and for the second

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:57.800
lockdown as well. We did miss each other and he missed my birthday and they had

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:06.200
offered an app, Google, whatever you want to call it. What is it again?

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.840
You can speak to it. Oh, what do you call it? Oh, my brain's gone.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:28.760
Google. Not Google. Alexa. Oh, right. Okay. Like a smart speaker thing. Yeah.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:42.840
And how have you found that using that? Okay. Okay. We set the alarms for work at 6.80 in the morning.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.080
Sometimes it's hard for me to do food shopping. Sometimes it's even hard for me to do cleaning

00:04:51.080 --> 00:05:01.400
and all. But it's quite handy to have it now and again to listen to like state of the crop music.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.000
So you mentioned that you've missed, obviously, miss George when you had lockdown. Was there any

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.640
talk about you moving in together at all doing that? We're not moving in together now

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:24.840
because of the benefits issue. Okay. Would you be worse off or something? Is it? Yeah, it would be

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:37.640
maybe worse off if we moved in together. Oh, so how does that affect your plans? Obviously,

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.360
you're engaged right now. How would that affect your ability if you got married to live together?

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:53.400
It will affect it a lot, but I don't know much. It will affect it. But it'd be cadence and allowance

00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:02.520
and all stuff like that. You know, so it'd be what? Sorry. No, no, sorry. Would the benefits

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:09.000
situation, if it wasn't for that, would you have moved in with him by now? Yeah, I would have,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.720
but because he's in the complex, yeah, like sort of complex with other people.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:31.240
I can't at the moment. Is it sheltered accommodation? Is it? Yeah.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:42.600
I see. So going back to March, did you think it would still be going on this long?

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:50.920
I thought it won't be going on too long if you know what I mean, but I'm pleased now

00:06:53.480 --> 00:07:05.000
coming out with these not relation things and I will allow it. I definitely will allow the

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.800
ejection. Yeah, because they announced that this morning, didn't they, that it's got been approved?

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:16.040
Yeah, I did know that. I missed out, but I turned over to something else I did.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:24.840
So obviously you work with kind of people first. Did you know how you were going to be able to do

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:36.840
your job when it first started back in March? We started come together in March, so we did

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:48.600
we did loads of stuff on live, holding around and all, so because the come together project

00:07:48.600 --> 00:08:01.080
did finish till October anyhow. And this new project which I'm doing now is about health,

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:10.280
so it's a different subject and this one's till March next year. Okay.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:21.720
Did you find it, how did you find having to work from home remotely then? We did first, but I got

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:31.640
used to it, but with this new project I need to go up, because of this new project what we're doing

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:43.080
now, I need to, what I feel like I need to do is go out and talk to, instead of doing online,

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.840
is go out and meet and talk about this new project to start, head

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:59.800
the bosses, the top bosses like Dick, Reg, Dimensions, you name it, you know,

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:08.120
even the assembly members, you name it, I go talk to them, because we got funding from

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:19.400
public health files and we have online meetings and all on Thursday at 9.30 till

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:31.800
like 11.00, except for the other Thursday, but we still meet Thursdays at 9.30 till 10.00, or then

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:39.960
you know, sorry if I keep it on. No, no, that's fine, so you know,

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:46.200
what were the biggest differences for you between, you know, working normally in an office with people

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:58.920
and having to do it online in your house? In the office I know what I was doing and I was out more,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:10.280
more, in the house I sometimes get tired a lot and not,

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:23.640
wasn't not interested, but I found it weird being on my own, does that make any sense?

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:31.400
No, yeah that makes sense, yeah, so you, you may be, not putting words in your mouth, but

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:38.840
you found it difficult not being around other people? Yeah, yeah, because I'm used to being

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:52.440
out and about more and I'm in more, that's the only straight thing about it. And so I,

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.960
it's worth mentioning I suppose that I've worked with you before, like I've done a couple of times,

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.760
is there anything that, where you think that you need support from someone that you haven't been

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:17.160
able to get? Not really, it's just I'm, to be honest and truthful, sometimes I am lazy to

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:30.120
tidy the flat up and all in that respect, but in supporting ways I got loads of support off work,

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:36.120
you know, with the tablet and all stuff like that. I understand where they're coming from,

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:46.600
they're coming from, if you know what I'm saying, they look for our wellbeing sort of thing,

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.480
our stress sort of thing, but

00:11:54.040 --> 00:12:01.720
because I have been tested and all stuff like this, I wish I could have been tested, but

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:06.520
because I have got none of the symptoms, which that's why, thank God,

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.160
I'm pleased about.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:22.040
And is it a worry that you could catch it at all, or are you worried about that?

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:32.440
Not really, I'm not all that worried if I could catch it, if I do catch it, it may be mild,

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.480
and that's, that's why

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:49.320
Wales are not doing, like London is doing, testing everybody in care homes,

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:59.640
they should do it for care homes in Wales. I think for people who's elderly, who've got

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:10.120
dementia and all, they need to do it in Wales as well as England. So we need to do that.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:22.280
I would like to be tested just to know if I have it or I have got it, if no one from my mind

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.480
arrests, so to say.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.160
Yeah, yeah, I quite like that.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:36.840
Well, so you said you live on your own?

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:38.520
Yes.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.640
During the first lockdown, did you see anyone at all?

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:51.800
Only my sister, I went up to, I went down the shop and then up to her house. I stayed outside

00:13:52.280 --> 00:14:01.400
and just not on the door. And I kept, with her steps out to the front door, I kept them,

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:08.680
it's like two meters sort of thing. I sat on the wall, she sat on the chair. So that's

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.600
sort of the two meters, if you know what I'm saying.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.840
Yeah, yeah, what did you talk about with her?

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:22.440
Just general stuff, how she is and how she's coping and all stuff like that.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:30.520
So, you know, at least I have a sister, only at the wrong sort of thing I'm pleased about.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.760
How did you feel having to live on your own for so long?

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:43.320
I sort of used to it, but I did miss George, I did miss him.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.840
And how did you keep in touch with George?

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:58.920
Through WhatsApp, phone in, blue messenger, you know, we kept it in our way, so to say.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.800
And how did he cope through it? I don't know.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.360
And how did he cope through it? Obviously, you said he lived in accommodation with other people.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.920
So how was he finding it compared to you?

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:23.080
He found it okay, but sometimes he said, because he thinks it is mental,

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:32.440
I don't say mental health problems, but he has mental health, sort of mental health problems.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:40.360
But he's thinking, oh, it's the cigarettes down my body and all stuff like that, because he can't

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:50.200
go to number two properly, so he's dreaming it on cigarettes. Which is

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:59.240
understandable, which, you know, it's all in his mind. So do you understand what I'm saying?

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.200
Do you understand what I'm saying? Yeah, I understand.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:18.760
And I'm trying to listen to him and reassuring me he's not dying and all stuff like this,

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:24.040
you name it. Which is quite difficult sometimes.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.760
Were you able to talk to anyone else then about what George was going through?

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:36.520
I only work online with Sue and all because they understand George as well as I do.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.040
So you felt like you had someone else to talk to? Yeah.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:50.440
And so, thinking of like practical things like going shopping, how did you manage to go shopping

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:56.600
during the first lockdown? My sister. Your sister did the shopping for you?

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:06.440
She did it. She picked some stuff up for me normally because Darren worked for the

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:12.680
card of presses. Oh, who's Darren? My sister's partner. Oh, okay.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:28.520
And he got a car. So he drove me and my sister to go shopping once.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:39.240
And we used these scanners in Tesco once. They were the easiest to go in March because

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:49.640
the first lockdown. But because we were in the car, we were okay. That's only like a small little

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:59.720
bubble. Then we did online shopping sort of thing. If you know what I mean?

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:07.320
So you didn't go to many shops during lockdown then? Not all that many. If I did,

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:15.480
I did go out and go into town maybe once or twice, but I didn't go too far, you know,

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:22.360
down to Cardiff sort of thing. Yeah. And how did you find that experience going out during lockdown?

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:32.280
We were the first with the, you know, I didn't wear the mask of firsts at all.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:44.280
Oh, you didn't, did you? No, not at first. How come? Because I got my last one.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:49.720
Oh, okay. I think they did it to the altar quite recently,

00:18:49.720 --> 00:19:03.880
if I remember. So I have been wearing them now, but because I got my last one, I got careful

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:11.240
by breathing as well. Yeah. I mean, how did you, how do you find wearing a mask? I hate them.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:21.160
I don't like them, but I know why you got to do it. That's the case. If you got the invite,

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:32.920
you know, got this, wherever you want to call it. I know why. You go in the shop,

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:42.120
we go in the taxi, definitely go in on a bus, but I have seen people with these passes

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:49.000
have been attacked on buses, which is quite good.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:59.400
Really? You feel safe on buses when other people are wearing the masks? Yeah. Yeah.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:04.680
And how do you find it talking to other people when they're wearing a mask?

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:17.160
Weird. Definitely weird. Weird in what way? You can't see them talk properly. You know they are

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:24.360
talking, because you can hear them talking, but it's difficult to hear them now and again.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.640
How does that make you feel?

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:46.200
I'm trying to think about that. I don't know. Oh, that old are weird? No. No. Oh, that's good.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.560
I'm thinking about that.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:59.480
And another thing, actually we'll come back to that. When the lockdown first finished,

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:06.520
how did you feel knowing that you could go and see people again? I was pleased. I was happy.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:11.880
I could go and see George, you know, and George could come up and stay here,

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:20.840
which he did do, you know. So you bubbled with George, did you? Yeah, I bubbled with George. I

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:28.600
bubbled with my sister, you know, because my sister's only live up the road and I've been

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.680
seeing her mum now and again.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.600
And how has your mother coped through all of it?

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:50.200
She's, oh, how can I put it? She wears a mask nearly 24 hours, so she put, she got in mind

00:21:50.760 --> 00:22:02.840
and sort of thing. She's scared in the way not to take the mask off. She does take the mask off

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:10.360
when she's up on the air and she takes it off when she's back home, but she don't take it off

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:19.480
when she's in town or like that. I do. Well, I'm not going to the shops or anything like that,

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:24.440
and I'm outside. I leave my mask off. You know what I'm saying?

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.320
Oh, mum, is he upset? To me. Okay.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:45.880
I know it's difficult to put it into words, so to say. No, no, I understand what you mean.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:54.040
So, I want to go back a little bit and talk about George a second. Is that okay?

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.920
Yeah, that's fine.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:03.640
How did you cope during lockdown with not being, like the physical side of relationship? I know

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:08.520
you could take that however you want, you know, hugging someone, just being able to be close to

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.320
someone. How did you find not being able to do that?

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:21.720
We didn't. I was a naughty girl. When we had the first lockdown, that felt so difficult,

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:32.760
and when the lockdown finishes, I was pleased. So, we did it. We did it. We did it.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:41.320
That felt so difficult, and when the lockdown finishes, I was pleased. So, we did it.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.560
First, we got back to mine.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.520
Oh, sorry. I think you broke up a little bit then, Dawn.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:57.160
It's very part that it was. I'll bring you back later.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.040
Okay. So, what were you saying then?

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:13.480
I was saying the first lockdown was quite difficult, but when the first lockdown

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:19.320
finishes and he could come up to mine, we did hug and kiss then.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:25.400
But did you find it difficult not having that contact with him?

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:31.480
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. At first, because we couldn't see each other at all.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:36.760
Oh, sorry.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.000
Was that the longest you'd been without seeing him?

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:44.840
I'm a poor whore.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.440
George tried to go through to my phone, that's all.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.520
I said, is that the longest period you've been away from George?

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:04.680
Yes. Yes. I will bring you back to second off my phone.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.720
It's been a long time.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:11.880
Pardon?

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.680
Are you talking to George or Paul right now?

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.440
You.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.160
Me, is it? Okay. You're going to ring me back to you?

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.200
No, I'll ring George back.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.360
Oh, it's okay. Sorry. Getting confused.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.280
When we first met, I would ring him straight back.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:34.920
Okay. So did you feel lonely at all during lockdown?

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:42.360
A little bit lonely, but because I had my sister up the road, I did.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.800
She had her partner and her boy to be.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:48.280
Yeah.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.840
Her partner and her boy to be.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:51.640
Yeah.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:57.560
And I felt all the old sort of things in that way.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.080
I told her so.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:12.840
In the mean way, in the nicest way.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:15.800
I understand.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:24.440
Has all of this affected your mood and how you feel about things in general?

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:32.360
No, not really. A little bit at the end, so it's known again, but not.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:34.760
Not.

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:40.360
I don't feel all I have, so to say.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.960
Now, what's the one thing you've missed during the last eight months?

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.840
Is there anything you've missed that you would really like to be able to do?

00:26:52.040 --> 00:27:01.720
Meeting people and talking to assembly members and all stuff like that.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.160
That's what I miss now.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.000
So partly a job and just being able to see people, is it?

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:15.320
Yeah. And tell them about the health passports, the new job I'm doing now

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:24.680
which is, you know, and we got, you know, I know we got to do it online at the moment,

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:31.880
but hopefully before long we can, you know, go out and meet people.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.680
Yeah, it'll be a few more months, I suspect.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.600
Yeah, for me.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:48.440
What was I going to ask? Sorry, oh yes. So,

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:55.960
do you, have there any, obviously you've mentioned George, but in terms of like your friends,

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.800
have you been able to stay in touch with them?

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.640
Sometimes on the web or WhatsApp.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:18.360
Except for Georgia, I have tried to, no wonder times Georgia. So I kept in contact with Eddie,

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:26.280
our old phone, blue messenger, WhatsApp, Wayne, blue messenger.

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:34.840
And, oh that's the thing, I can leave a voice message for him about that job.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.400
I can tell him no.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:47.000
I think he will like that. Because it will fit my benefits.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.200
Oh yes, yes. Always a problem that, isn't it?

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:58.760
Yeah, at the moment, because I'm doing 10 hours, I can't do the, because this one's up to March,

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:04.200
and your one's like 15 hours, it will fit my benefits.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:10.840
The new job, will make up for it, will fit my benefits if I do too.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.960
Yeah, oh that's fair enough, that's understandable.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:20.040
So I go like, no thank you, but no thank you.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.120
With like friendships and maybe groups,

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.720
has there been any online things you've been able to do, like quizzes or

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.720
people having sing-alongs and stuff like that?

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:47.720
I know I got on my tablet, the Insight app, where you talk about Paul from Inrate.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:57.960
I've been on it maybe once or twice. I need to get on it because I need to talk to

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:10.200
the bosses of the houses for that, because then they know what I'm talking about.

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:18.200
At the moment, I'm quite, I guess not stuck,

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:30.520
it won't let me get on, because every time I put the password in, it's not recognizing it or

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:39.560
something, or I'm doing something wrong. But I'm like, by my head, I get a bit more sometimes.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:45.640
So I go get on it, because they told me off.

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:56.680
But it sounds like maybe you haven't been interacting with people too much on Zoom or Teams then?

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:07.720
For work, yes. Teams, because we work on Teams with work colleagues and all, stuff like that.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:20.360
Yeah, as well as for Zoom, we do stand-up speaking out meetings, so we do that on Zoom.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:29.560
That's the only two I'm doing at the moment. I know I need to do more,

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:33.720
but it's just finding the time to do it.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:50.920
I go somewhere inside that somewhere and I don't know how.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:56.680
That's how I see you, Christian.

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:06.040
Yes, sort of. Obviously, you mentioned you hate wearing a face mask and things.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:12.520
How have you found following all of the different rules? Do you think you've always understood them?

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:23.720
I understood the reason being why you go in face masks in shops and taxis and buses and all.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:33.320
But when you are outside walking, I thought you don't need to wear a face mask.

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.520
That's the other side of things.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:48.600
If you know what I'm trying to say, but when you come back out from a shop or anything like that,

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:56.360
I don't mind doing that. I understand why.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:03.160
There's nothing that you've wondered or I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do in this situation?

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:12.040
No, no, no. Except for now and again, but other times, no, no.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:17.400
Have you had support from work or someone else to understand those rules?

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:27.640
I've been looking around on Facebook, Low Disability Wales has been sending them an easy read

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:39.640
as far as they do the video thing about it. I do understand why, yes.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:49.240
Oh, hello.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.360
Let your phone go in.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.640
Sorry, it's only me and half.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.800
You're trying to get a hold of me.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.640
He really wants to speak to you, doesn't he?

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.040
Oh, can I let him know I'm on video call on the net?

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.640
Yeah, you can do that.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:41.880
Okay.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:43.240
Hello.

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.040
Oh, no. Sorry about that.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:47.800
I said two minutes.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.920
We're nearly done, don't worry.

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:59.960
So what's the, do you think there's been any good things that come out of the last few months?

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:12.040
These calculations now, which goes proof, which I'm pleased about, but it is

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:22.920
in the virus, as I said, all right, to stop you out of the virus.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:30.360
Yes, yeah, that's a very good thing. I was thinking more sort of like, you know,

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:37.400
some people think that it's good, like, so like me, for example, I don't have to drive to go to

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.560
work anymore. I'm saving a lot of money on petrol.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:45.080
Other people feel it's been quite useful because they get to spend more time at home with their

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:50.520
families, not traveling. Is there anything you found that actually you quite like about the way

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:51.400
things are right now?

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:56.200
No, no, it's the opposite.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:04.680
It's the opposite for me. I prefer to be out than about, Paul. You should know that by now.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:14.680
I used to be an out of my person. I'd be, I don't know, like,

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:24.760
Monday or Wednesday or Friday, but if I'm working, I like to be out working, not in working.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.880
You spent quite a lot of time at home in the last two months. How was that?

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.040
How do you now think about your home?

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.040
I want to get out.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.600
I want to get out, so to say.

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:54.920
I'll say that in the new year, hopefully, I will be moved from Newport to Cardiff.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:59.000
Oh, okay. So you lived in Cardiff before, didn't you?

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:00.380
Yes.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.520
How come you've decided to move back?

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:12.600
Because my partner lives in Cardiff, my work's in Cardiff, so it's got to be Cardiff.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:18.280
Okay. How do you think the relationship, obviously, you said your sister and your

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.480
mother live close to you. How will that affect your relationship with them, do you think?

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:28.840
I want to be sort of sad but happy because she could come down to Cardiff

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:40.520
to see me. It'd be difficult for all the enemy, but we still got that connection,

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:47.160
anyhow, so I could come up to her or she could come down to me, vice versa.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.320
That's understandable.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:54.220
So...

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:55.560
Be to move.

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:56.060
Be to move.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.000
Sounds like you're desperate to go then.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:03.720
I'm desperate to go, but my sister's not...

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:11.480
don't like the idea of me moving from Newport, so to say.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.600
But I'm ready to do a new

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:28.440
chapter in my life.

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.600
Yeah, that's understandable.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:38.360
So my last question is, is there anything you're looking forward to doing,

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:41.560
what's the one thing you can't wait to do when all the rules are gone?

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.920
Go out, meet new people and talk and talk.

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.480
Okay, yeah, I can see why that would be important to you.

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.400
I go to the pub.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:57.900
But...

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:02.200
Have you found, actually I'm gonna ask you one more question on that, have you found

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:07.800
it easy to stay healthy during lockdown?

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.560
During lockdown, like...

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.240
Yes and no.

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:19.240
I don't drink all I mention alcohol.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:20.460
Okay.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:35.480
I stopped drinking alcohol after my birthday.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:36.460
Hmm.

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:45.160
Then I got became well, because my blood pressure is up down like a yo-yo,

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:49.400
so I got became for having salt in my food.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:50.940
Okay.

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:58.920
So I'm on blood pressure tablet, so I don't drink any alcohol,

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:02.360
but I will be drinking all Christmas anyhow.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:09.160
It's a little bit difficult to stay healthy over lockdown, what did that mean for you?

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:17.160
Because I borderline diabetic, I will be diabetic next year.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:18.460
Okay.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.240
So I got became for why I eat more now.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:29.320
So is it, was it struggling with eating healthy you struggled with, is it?

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.280
Yeah, yeah.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:34.680
I buy you drink food more than anything else.

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:44.680
Okay, well I think that's it done, let you get back to George who obviously wants to speak to you.

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:51.240
I'm gonna stop the recording now, and I find the button, there we go.
