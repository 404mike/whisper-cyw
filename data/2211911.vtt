00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So when you are five years old, I start school, primary school.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Okay, so to class two, when you are in class two, I go to school sometimes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Sometimes I'm not good.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And my father is carpenter.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
My father worked, someone makes someone is house, chair, table, this one, the wooden one.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Carpenter means wooden carpenter.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
My mom is housewife at that time.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And my father, for Indian money, every day 20 rupees per day.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And my three, I'm three sisters, one brother.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So the one is baby, and the middle one and my brother go to school with me.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Then when you are in class two, then I'm seven years old.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And one day my father doing the work and my father fell there.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And my father broken legs, hand, back, everything.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And hospital, India everyone know hospital pay for everything.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Nothing to free India.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
School, only primary school, class five is free.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Otherwise you pay for everything, medicine, doctor, school, college, everything is paid.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So when my father failed, and then someone came to my house and they say to my mom,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
your husband failed and he is really in danger position.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And my mom and every children go run and there.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Then I, you know rickshaw?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Yes.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Rickshaw.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So I take my father in the rickshaw, the three wheeler rickshaw there,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and take to the hospital and nobody admit my father.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000
They say you have money to register and everything, pay for everything, bed and everything.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I said, my mom said don't have money.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And I'm just stand like this and I see all the thing.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And then say, okay, I can't admit this person without money.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And then that time is Indian four o'clock.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And then again come back home and you know the house is not like this, small, small house like

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
called Jhopadpatti, I don't know what is English, I don't know.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Huts.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Huts.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So my father put some mattress, not mattress, you know the chattai and everything and my mat

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and my father sleep there.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
All night my father cry.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:28.000
That time I realized without money nothing to this life, no education, nothing to do.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I make money.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I don't know how do I make money but I'm realized seven years old children how to feel when

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
your father cry.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And then I'm decide same day night time I'm decide I'm never go anywhere, school nothing

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I'm go to work.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000

And next day I ask some lot of people I ask have some work, have some work.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Nobody agree with me.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
My mom don't know this one.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And then I say okay and one girl is my neighbor she work in the Calcutta town and I'm go there.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So I call like auntie, I say auntie I need a work.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And they say you really agree with this one.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I say can't say to my mom okay.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000

She said this girl and she said okay you stay there because this town is too busy.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I don't know where you go.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And then she came Shalda station and she pick up me.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And she go there.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
That time nearly I'm 11 years old.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
And then I'm start to one Madhuri family.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Clean job.

And that time I don't know how to iron clothes.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
So they teach me slowly slowly slowly.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
When you one month finish and come back home and I give you too many.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
That time I have a salary 500 per month.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Rupees.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Everyone happy because I have a nice job.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000

Have a good money every month.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Then nobody not say anything.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Go school college nothing.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
I'm just try try try and slowly slowly.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
I do work slowly slowly.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
I'm go up up up.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Today 700 tomorrow 1000 like this.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
And on day my father say he select some boy to married.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
That time I'm 13 years old.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
In a village side they married early.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
I don't know the boy.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Okay.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
I'm never see nothing.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And the boy is not Bengali.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
He is a UP people like.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Is this the area is district district is barely nearby Delhi maybe nearby Delhi.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
I don't know the boy nothing.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Even I don't have any idea what they do with me.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
And then I'm go there.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
My father do married and everything finish married.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
They take me is a barely.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:59.000
And then one day when they say something I say why you talk like this people with me like badly they behave badly.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And then I asked to.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
I'm not I'm almost some percent.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
I don't know that time Hindi language.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:15.000
So slowly slowly I'm land because I'm thinking like every Bengali people married and go husband house.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Maybe same with me.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
But there is something is different.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Because there is three brother and they have a system the three brother one wife.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:40.000
And then nearly one year I'm finished and then I send some letter to my father.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
That time no phone call nothing.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:54.000
I send some letter to my father because I know Bengali language little bit not really well but slowly slowly I write one letter to my father.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
I know my address and everything.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:07.000
I pushed the letter and I say immediately you came here and my father go there.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
And my father say I take my daughter home.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:18.000
My religion is not allowed to one wife and three brother.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
And then they say no you can't take your daughter back.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
My father say why.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Because my father don't know I don't know they pay for when they married me they pay bigger money to you know middle the percent who who bring me who bring the boy to Calcutta.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
The middle person like you bring me here.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
So middle is someone.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:59.000
The person pay for my first husband pay for nearly Indian rupees 14000 to me.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
So I say I'm not bread and sweet.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Someone sell to me.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
How to sell to me I'm not gold not anything I'm some person.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
So how do they sell me.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
And my husband say they have a proof.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
They have proof.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000
And then my father can't allow to take me because some some one why me.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
So how to take back.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
And then I'm crying I say.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
My father I call always Baba I say Baba I'm not.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Sit here I'm not here.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
I don't like the person they behave like this and I'm not.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Sit here you take me and my father say you sit here I'm go home I'm decide and maybe I talk to all the people and someone you know chairman member and they will decide what to do.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:05.000

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Slowly slowly slowly slowly my life 12 years I'm spend there like this.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Five o'clock I'm get up and I do everything house finish housework and everything no electric no gas nothing there.

And then go outside work with my husband and husband is other brother my father in law everyone go together take lunch.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
And I do really hard work.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
I don't know I'm pregnant actually.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000

My father can't call not come back to bring me nobody contact with me.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Then I'm decide how to go Calcutta again.

One day I'm decide maybe I'm do suicide then I'm go alone.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000

So yeah, yeah this time I use the safe house but I can't move because I don't have money to go one house you know I can't afford this one.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:30.000
It's too expensive maybe nearly 1000 pounds to rent and everything so yeah I use safe house.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:43.000
Maybe one day I have my good work and good salary then I move and go my own house.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Is there anything else you'd like to tell us before we talk about the objects and some memories with the museum.

She says she's not interested in jewelry, clothes, food, nothing. But she needs to have a job so that her kids can benefit and they have a brighter future.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:44.000
I never wanted anything else in my life. I always wear old clothes and I'm already grown up.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:54.000
I wear the same clothes that someone gave me. I don't want anything else. I really don't want anything else.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:04.000
I wish my kids could have a better life. I want to know before I die that my kids have a better life.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.000

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:18.000
She says that she has been living with people, had it down, things, clothes and whatever.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:26.000
She said it's better anymore. It's only before I die I want to make sure my kids have a better future and they have achieved.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.000
That's all she aims for and would like to work for, than the kids.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.000
She's very smart.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
Her son is 17.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Last year my two sisters helped me a little bit with money.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:18.000
They gave me nearly 100 pounds. This Indian Rupee is 10,000, 20,000 like this.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000

Then everyone need a food.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
So mom don't have money.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000
So how to buy everything and make food?

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
And she said, they never pay.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000
I say why?

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Oh, they said tomorrow I will pay and after tomorrow, all every day I'm go there and they

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
I say, okay, let's go.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000
One day I'm go there and I ask money and they start to shouting with me.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000
I said, don't shouting with me.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:26.000
Otherwise I tell every neighbor and they going to know you really bad person.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000
You know my situation.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
You know my position.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000
I don't have anything in the house.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000
So why you not pay money?

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
And then they say, you say everyone then say.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000
I say, okay, then wait.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:48.000
And then I'm go with two, three friend and say to everyone, you know the man is cheater,

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:54.000
cheater and they never pay anyone, can't give anyone anything to this man.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000
And then, you know, my blaze is member.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000
I'm go to the member and I say, uncle, they never pay.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:11.000
My mom is money, say to the person and they have then again they ask, talk to everyone

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:18.000
and they say, okay, so maybe one day they have a meeting with everyone where I say,

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000
so what?

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000
You never pay.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000
You never pay.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
That's why every day coming to your house, you not give money.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:31.000
So I'm say to everyone, then there is meeting, finish end of the meeting.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:37.000
They pay there because the members say, okay.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000
How old were you?

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:44.000

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Even my mom, all the time she have a problem because she can't say anything.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000
She just ask money and they not.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000
They shout with mom.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:17.000
They don't have any right to shout with my mom because my mom give thing and they pay for the one.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
So why you shout with my mom?

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000
I don't like this one.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Lot of things like this.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Not only one thing.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000
Village side, you don't know because nobody know.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000
My life's really, really hard life.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Now I'm, oh, so iPhone, everyone have a television, smart phone, TV.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
They have a dining table.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000
You know, full life I don't have bed.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
I'm sleep in the floor.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Full life.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000
Last year I make one bed.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000
So everyone surprised, my sister, everyone surprised.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Oh, need bed now.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Why you make bed in the Calcutta?

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:08.000
I say when you come back, then I need a bed because whole life I'm sleep in the floor.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000
Whole life I don't have bed.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.000
I'm thinking, oh, maybe I spend money to bed is not good.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
Okay, I'm sleep in the floor.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000
Maybe next year, maybe next year, next year, next year.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
Now is 47.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.000
I never make bed.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000
Everyone have a bed.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
My mom have a small bed.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000
My sister, everyone have a bed.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000
My husband and me sleep in the floor.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000
My husband say lot of time buy readymade bed.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000
I say no.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
It's lot of money.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Why you waste money?

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000
When you old, can't move, then I make bed.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000
Now I make.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000
Last year I make one bed.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000
I spend little bit money.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.000
You know, one time in the Calcutta tsunami came.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000
Then I lost my one tree, bigger one.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000
The tsunami came, then tree fell.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Then I use the one, I make bed.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
So you made a bed from tree?

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Yeah.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Wow, how did you do that?

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000
Can you tell us?

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.000
You know, my husband take the tree, cut small, small portion.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000
And then go to the machine.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000
You know machine, they cut wooden tree.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:31.000
And there, then come back, everything bring home.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:37.000
And then I call some carpenter because I don't have dad before I have a dad.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000
Carpenter, nice carpenter, designer carpenter.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000
But now I call someone outside one and they make home.

Do you have a picture?

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000
Not here.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Maybe they need, then I send it to anyone.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Nice design one they make now.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000
Yeah.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Did you think of your bed in museum when you saw the people sleeping on wood?

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
Did it make you think of sleeping on the floor maybe?

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.000
Yeah.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.000
Yeah.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000
The small, small wood.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000
My mom have now this, like this, palanquin.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000
Palanquin.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000
Yeah.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000
The Indian one, Indian people call palanquin.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000
So yeah, small one.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000
And the inside like this and like this.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
Look really nice, isn't it?

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000
So that's why I have a lot of memory in the museum.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000
Lot of.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000
So was that the first time you've been to any museum or was it just the first time you've been to that museum?

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000
First time I've been to this museum.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
Had you been to other museums before?

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.000
First time in any museum.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.000
Wow.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000
We're privileged to share that day with you.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000
Thank you.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Really a privilege.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000
Do you want, we'll finish up soon.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.000
We've been here a while.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000
You must be very tired.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.000
Yeah.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Do you want to tell us about the blanket or the dougamar?

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000
Yeah.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Which one are both?

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.000
We can tell you.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Yeah.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000
Dougamar or your blanket.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000
Those are childhood memories.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.000
We have good memories with both.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000
The dougamar is high.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.000
You know blanket, this blanket made every Bengali.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Maybe.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.000
Is it a blanket or is it a bedspread?

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.000
No, it's blanket and bedspread both of make handmade.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000
The dougamar, both of is different.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Someone is little bit thinner and someone is little bit thicker.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:43.000
So both of you, someone make both of you same design.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:51.000
And basically Bengali people use white, white color clothes and they have a design.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000
They make design handmade.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000
I do this one.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000
My mom, my, I'm three sister.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Everyone make this one.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:10.000
So that one is basically Bengali people when you have a married girls and like daughter is married.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000
So they give it to with daughter.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Very impressive.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Yeah.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000
Every mom and now nothing.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Blanket buy outside expensive company one, maybe Jara one, maybe other other company.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000
That time don't have company.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.000
So they make homemade.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:36.000
Well, sometime they go neighbor auntie and everyone came and she said, oh, I know this design.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000
You know, this is the better design.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:52.000
And they one side they make and one side they make like this lot of the lady sit together and they and that one is Bengali language called Naxikatha.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:59.000
Naxikatha is name and this Naxikatha have a story also in the book.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Because Katha is a story.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Yeah.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Naxikatha is some story actually.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:20.000
But when you the Naxikatha start the first embroidered someone this thing, then they start in the book and you know Naxikatha and she know Bengali is really, really important.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:25.000
The Naxikatha every house have someone maybe they not make they give someone.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.000
Can I make for me this one?

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.000
They everyone have a house because it's actually Bengali traditional thing.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:49.000
This one like Durga Ma Durga Ma also Bengali traditional Hindu Hindu every Hindu every year every single year they they keep money to Durga Puja.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.000
That's it.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Sometimes people call the Sarah Sarah and after Durga Puja then is Diwali.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:57.000
