00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760
Okay Deepak Dab, we want to ask you about, little bit about your involvement in Durga

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.240
Puja in Cardiff and the Durga Puja festival.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.840
Can you give us a short summary how and when you got involved and how you got involved

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.640
and what was the Puja like at that time?

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:34.120
Well, I came to Cardiff in 1978 on actually Shabtami day.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.880
So I finished my work on that day and in the evening I was looking through the yellow pages

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.840
to find out, I can find any Bengali names.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.800
So I found to, the first person I rang is Mr. Mishso without knowing whether he was

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.560
a Bengali or not, not Bengali.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.040
So luckily he was found to be Bengali and he said there is a Puja.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.720
So I was so delighted.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:06.200
So he came down to my hotel, picked me up and took me to the parade.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.460
The Puja was being held at the parade at that time.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.320
So I was so delighted to see that few families are involved in that Puja.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.680
And first thing I thought, I took my shoes off from outside of the door and I said, can

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.800
I be of any help?

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.640
I don't mind doing something for here.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.120
And somebody said, yes, you can do this and that.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.640
So I got involved on the first day.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:42.440
I went to the Puja organized by Bengali Association Wales and I think it was a delightful experience

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:49.080
on the first day and I never could detach myself from the Puja yet.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.880
How do you think it has developed over the years?

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.840
You have been associated with the Puja for a long time.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:07.120
I think the initial few years I got a feeling that we had a difference of opinion between

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.680
some of the members within the group.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:16.080
But we resolved the issues, whatever we had, and then formed different groups and started

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:25.960
the Puja with the new name WPC.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.960
That was 1982 and 1983.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.960
Am I right, Kanti?

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.960
1982 and 1983.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.960
1982.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.040
WPC was formed.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:58.320
And can you remember some of the fond memories of Puja or the festival itself?

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.320
Of course I can.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:11.320
During the early part of the 80s, I think everybody was very enthusiastic to celebrate

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.200
the Puja in here rather than something else.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:25.080
But I think over the years, we not only wanted to celebrate, but we had to spread the idea

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:35.280
of Durga Puja and the meaningful things related to Durga Puja among our children.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.600
So the angle slightly changed.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.600
We tried to get them involved as well when the children were very, very young.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:55.120
So they came and watched the Puja and the mingling of people between themselves so that

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.720
they can enjoy the union of these people coming to the Puja and trying to relate to

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:10.720
people like us, our age group, trying to relate back home.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.720
It's kind of reminiscing the past in that way.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.720
And we were hoping at that time that our children would learn from our mingling with other people

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.720
during the Puja.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:31.720
So once in the whole year, we get together after a few months, a gap of 12 months, 11

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.720
months, whatever.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.720
That was the joy of it.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.720
So we enjoyed that occasion very much.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:46.720
And what do you think has managed to bring the group together and keep it together over

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.720
so many years?

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:56.720
I think the majority of the thing is related to the feelings about Durga Puja and the values

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.720
in our cultural life.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:06.720
I think people slowly understood that the cultural aspects of Durga Puja is far more

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:14.720
important than just the religious part of it or celebrating the Puja and doing all sorts

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.720
of merrymaking.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.720
I think at a later stage, I think we wanted to spread it around the local people as well

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.720
so that the other people can understand us better culturally.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.720
And the cultural cohesion is a little bit enhanced.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.720
So we tried slowly.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:47.720
We moved our initial Durga Puja feelings to understanding people within the community

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.720
we live in.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:59.720
So we invited other people to organize different events so that we can showcase our cultural

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.720
side of our community and the other people can understand us better.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.720
Okay.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.720
Thank you very much, Deepak Dhar.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.720
Thank you.
