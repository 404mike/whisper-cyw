00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
You came to Cardiff in 1954.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.360
Yes.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.840
So there must have been big changes in Cardiff over that.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.600
Oh!

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.160
It was a wonderful city.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.240
I mean, it's changed completely.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.960
I mean, number one, there were all these refugee, Jewish refugees here.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.400
We had a Jewish club here.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.080
We had a Jewish restaurant here.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.360
I had a Jewish factory here.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.920
Screx, worldwide factory here, making kosher meat.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.760
The Jewish businesses that prospered here were amazing how they came to.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.040
And Cardiff has changed, of course it has.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.640
I suppose it's changed for the better.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.680
I mean, it's a beautiful city we live in now.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.880
I don't think there's anywhere in the UK, really,

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.040
that can compare the provincial city and the amenities you've got,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.440
with the bay and all.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.200
I would never go.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.960
I have the opportunity.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.400
My wife's family have property in London,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.800
and my brother-in-law and I are very much involved.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.720
And perhaps in four or five years' time, I will probably end up there,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.840
because when I'm too old, my daughter will insist on it.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.200
But I would be very reluctant to leave Wales.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.000
And it's just such a lovely city.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.720
And the people are lovely here.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.880
I walk around the lake every morning.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.280
I actually don't walk around the lake.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.360
I do 14 miles walking every day.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.400
And the people who I've met and made friends with,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.880
not Jewish, because nobody's here anymore, are wonderful.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.600
They saved me these last three years, I can tell you.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.680
People who've made me cup for coffee,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.600
professional people, non-professional people.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.120
We meet, we talk, we laugh, men and women.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.800
And it's lovely.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.760
Every Friday morning, I sit with four very nice ladies,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.880
all professional.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.920
And it's safe, literally, I wouldn't have done without them.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.840
And it's different in London.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.040
We're like a family here.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.480
I have to say that, you know, not Jewish, I'm not talking about.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.800
I'm talking about non-Jewish people.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.280
You're from Kingcoy.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.360
Yes.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.640
I've been living there very...

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.520
We had a beautiful house.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.840
We sold the house because we wanted to go to a flat.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.680
The time had come, it was too big.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.480
My wife, bless her, we were only there.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.840
She was only eight weeks.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.040
And I was so lucky.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.040
I was in a terrible state.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.600
And a flat became available.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.520
And I thought to myself, I've got to get out of here.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.800
I sold my flat literally within one morning

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.640
and I bought the other one in the afternoon.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.400
And now I'm living in Alsthavn Kingcoy, in Bromwood Avenue.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.760
And I'm so happy there.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.080
It's just a block of seven people, private car park. Wonderful.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.000
I've got the whole top floor and I'm very happy.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.440
Well, as happy as can be, you know.
