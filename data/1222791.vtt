00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
So you were in Buenos Aires for a while in Argentina.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.240
Did you move around in Argentina then

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.640
or did you stay in Buenos Aires?

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.280
I stayed in, no, it was the other way around.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.880
I went, when my money ran out,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.880
I started working in Buenos Aires.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.880
But by that time, I had already met my father's,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.760
next up, Uncle Walter,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.900
brother and his wife.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.680
And their daughter had gone to a meeting

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:58.880
in America.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.560
That was Uncle Walter's wife.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.840
All right, that's Tanta Emi to me.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.760
Right, okay.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.000
All right, these are my two who are now 40.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.800
This is a picture with the ribbon on the frame.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.720
Yeah, okay.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.280
Yeah.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.320
So then you came back from Argentina.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.160
Sorry.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.320
Yeah.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.160
Yeah.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.240
Right, I went to Rio Tisero

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.920
to see my father's eldest brother

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.960
with his wife.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.240
And they didn't have any children of their own.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.520
They had adopted a girl who was really nasty to them.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.560
For whatever reason.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.280
All the brothers,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.640
if you saw them walking, you would know that they belonged.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.640
They all, as they walked, somehow a hand, as they walked,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.520
they walked with this hand like that.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.880
With the right hand twisted back.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.080
Yeah. Yeah.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.160
Really odd.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.200
Like paddling, was it?

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.840
They all had that.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.440
I mean, Uncle Walter, when he walked, Uncle Herbert,

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.240
Uncle Peter, I didn't know.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.640
One of the older brothers I didn't get to know.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.560
Yeah.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.520
I got on very, very well with Uncle Herbert,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.520
and he had wanted me to stay in Rio Tisero.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.080
He practically built, I don't know what made him go out there,

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.360
but he practically built the town.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.040
It was quite a bustling town.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.040
He said he could remember when there was horses,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.720
when there were no roads, and they all rolled,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.880
and he could remember tethering the,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.520
as you do in cowboy films, tethering it to a bar,

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.200
tethering the horse to a bar.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.520
So you came back to the UK.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.800
Yeah, sorry, I'm still in Rio Tisero.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.920
I then went back to Buenos Aires,

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.320
and then as the money had run out,

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.320
I then went to work in English Electric.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.680
And I was there for the Bay of Pigs incident.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.520
Right.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.600
My parents were extremely worried,

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.200
but as we all know, nothing happened.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.080
I was there for the Bay of Pigs incident.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.920
Right.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.080
Nothing happened.
