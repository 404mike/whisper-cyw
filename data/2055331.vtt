WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We are.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We are.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We are.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We are.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We are.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You said.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We are.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
You said.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You said.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We are.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
You said.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We are.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
You said.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We are.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.960
We are...

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.840
Ushed!

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.840
We are...

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.120
The Blyther Ushed!

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.920
And we've been doing a project about...

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.840
The myths and legends of North Wales.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.340
So now we're going to tell you the story of Cantor Gwelod.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.880
Or... the War of the Well.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.240
People say the land of Cantor Gwelod lies far below the sea in Cardigan Bay.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.240
They say that in the Middle Ages it was a marshy land that ran beside the coast with gates to keep out the sea.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.240
The King of Cantor Gwelod appointed a man called Saith Ennin to shut the gates at high tide.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.240
And open them again at low tide.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.240
But Saith Ennin was a drunk.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.240
So one day he forgot to shut the gates and the sea came in and drowned the land.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.240
But we know another much older version of this story.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.240
Which we're going to tell you now.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.240
With a bit of our own embroidery.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.240
After all, that's what you do with legends, isn't it?

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.240
You change them.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.240
In this version of the legend, the daughter of the King is called Mererid.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.240
I'm going to be Mererid now.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.240
When I was a little girl, my father the King said...

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.240
Mererid, I'm going to make you the priestess of our sacred well.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.240
Every day you must draw three buckets of water from the well and carry them for a mile.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.240
Then empty them into the river by the castle.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.240
A mile? That's a long way.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.240
Yep.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.240
Three buckets?

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.240
Yep.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.240
Every morning?

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.240
Yep. And every night.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.240
That's a lot of buckets.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.240
Yep.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.240
That's six buckets.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.240
Is it? Yes, I think so. Three plus three equals...

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.240
It is, Dad. I know.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.240
I did GCSE maths at the Cantrigal College School for princesses.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.240
Well, anyway, this will all keep the spirit of the sacred well happy.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.240
Who, in turn, will keep everything happy in our kingdom.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.240
And what if I don't want to do it?

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.240
Then the spirit of the sacred well will let fall a curse upon the land.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.240
What kind of curse?

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.240
Not a clue.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.240
Anyone ever seen this spirit?

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.240
Nope. It's a bit like the god of the 21st century.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.240
The who of the what?

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.240
The god of the 21st century.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.240
In the future, it hasn't happened yet.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.240
You never see him, but you have to believe.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.240
Hmm. Not sure I do.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:22.240
Well, here I am, 16 years later, carrying those buckets.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.240
I've been doing it for so many years now that I've really had enough.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.240
My hands hurt. More than anything, my hands hurt.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.240
My legs feel heavy. Gravity is constantly against me.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.240
But I can't disappoint my dad.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.240
Don't want to be a failure.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.240
And with this curse, I've got no choice anyway.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.240
Oh well. No more complaining.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.240
Just get on with it.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.240
The locals watch Merarid come and go.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.240
Every day she goes past here with her buckets.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.240
My name's Matt. I've lived in Canterbury all my life.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.240
Working in the fields.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.240
Now and again, I like to pop down to my local Canterbury Railroad pub

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.240
for an occasional pint of Guinness. Just the odd one.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.240
The odd one, did you say, Grandad?

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.240
I think it might be a few more than that.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.240
Well, I reckon I deserve it, Siwan.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.240
So I watch her go past every day with her buckets

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.240
and I think not much of a life is it for a young woman.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.240
I wouldn't like it.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.240
Just lately, I see her looking more and more fed up.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.240
There'll be trouble there one day, Siwan. You mark my words.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.240
She won't put up with it forever.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.240
On a fine day, when I'm in the park garden outside, you can hear her muttering.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.240
Why must I do this? Is it even necessary?

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.240
Would anyone even notice if I just didn't?

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.240
What would happen?

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.240
What would be the consequences?

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.240
I hate lugging these horrible, heavy buckets around.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.240
If I could stop doing it, I would.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.240
I want to lose this heavy burden once and for all.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.240
I want to be free.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.240
But there's the curse.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.240
Oh, is there?

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.240
This spirit might not even be for real.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.240
All this pain, all these aches, all this suffering be for nothing.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.240
It could all be false.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.240
One day, a prince called Rodri makes a royal visit to Mereid's father,

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.240
and Princess Mereid comes up with what she thinks is a wonderful plan.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.240
That night, at a great feast held in honor of Rodri,

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.240
Princess Mereid has a secret, whispered conversation with him.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.240
What a wonderful feast this is, isn't it, Prince Rodri?

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.240
And all in your honor.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.240
Yes, thank you. The best I've ever attended.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.240
It's such a shame it might be the last one we ever have.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.240
The last? Why?

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.240
Surely a kingdom like this has many more feasts in its future.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.240
Oh, I thought you already knew. Sorry, excuse me, I shouldn't have said anything.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.240
My father will be home.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.240
No, don't leave. I won't tell him. What's going on?

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.240
Well, no, I really shouldn't tell you.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.240
You could trust me.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.240
It's just...Centra Gwelod is in trouble.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.240
Our fields seem to be producing less and less these days.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:37.240
We had to sacrifice our servants' food for two days to be able to provide this feast.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.240
And our army's getting weaker and weaker.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.240
We have so few men left.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.240
Really? I had no idea.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.240
I'm just so worried that soon someone might invade us.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.240
And whoever it was, I suppose I'd have to marry them.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.240
What if it's a monster of a man?

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.240
That would be awful. Is there any way I can help?

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:07.240
Well, I did wonder. No, you wouldn't do that. Ignore me.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.240
No, tell me. I want to help.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:16.240
Well, it's just, if you were to invade, you'd surely succeed, wouldn't you?

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.240
And I wouldn't mind marrying you.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.240
I know you'd care for our people, put us back on track.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.240
But I couldn't do that. Your father trusts me.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.240
Well, you might be saving us from worse.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.240
Well...

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.240
Oh, please, please save our kingdom.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.240
Oh, well. If it's to save the kingdom, then...

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.240
All right, let's meet later to plan things in detail.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.240
But I'd better go now and drink some wine with the King before he gets suspicious.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.240
Yes! Well, that was easy.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.240
And once I'm married to Rodri, I can live in his kingdom.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.240
And get away from the stupid well.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.240
It won't matter if the curse falls here.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:11.240
So, Merarid gets Rodri on site, then everything goes wrong with the plan.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:16.240
Mabon again. And all I want is a quiet pint after a hard day's work.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:21.240
But oh, no, not in Cantra Greylord. I'm just sitting down with my Pints of Guinness.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.240
And the next thing I know, I hear these drums.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.240
And they get closer and closer. I'm watching the vibrations of them in my pint.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.240
Then there's a silence. And I'm just about to take a drink.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:38.240
When the next minute a window breaks and a man hurls through it.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:46.240
And then a whole horde of men come clashing in, fighting over falling in the pub soldiers.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.240
Grandad! Grandad! Are you in there?

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.240
Come on, you need to leave. There's a battle going on.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:09:00.240
I grab my pint and I try dodging all the fists to make it to Sion at the back door.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.240
Next thing, a white goat comes running through the door.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:11.240
And knocks me off my feet, leaving me and my pint on the floor.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.240
So I help him up. Grandad, not the goat.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.240
Suddenly we're stuck in the middle of a battle. I'm lucky to make it home alive.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.240
What a night. All I wanted was a quiet pint.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:30.240
In the battle, it is Rodri's invading army that is defeated, not the army of Cantigualod.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:36.240
So Mereyd's plan fails. Prince Rodri has taken prisoner. He is furious.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:41.240
That wretch Mereyd. She lied. This country isn't weak at all.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:47.240
How dare she whisper poison in my ears. Make me risk my men. All my people.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.240
Why did I fall for such a pretty face and pretty allies?

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:57.240
I wish I could go back in time and cover my ears. Protect them from the poison that slowly seeped into them.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:06.240
I was such an idiot. Now, here in this prison, these thoughts, these regrets.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.240
They won't leave me alone. I can't take it anymore.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:15.240
I need to escape. I need to escape this endless silence.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:20.240
Shall I tell the king who betrayed him? Tell him it was his own daughter.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:26.240
I know he wants to know. Maybe. Maybe I could use it as a bargaining chip.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.240
Maybe he'll let me go free if I tell him.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:33.240
While Rodri schemes, Mereyd knows her life hangs in the balance.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:41.240
So now it's all over. My plan has failed. I don't know what to do. My father's going to find out what I've done.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:47.240
Rodri will tell him. Will he show me mercy? Does he even know how?

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.240
I wish I never tried to escape from my life.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:58.240
I just felt so trapped, so burdened by duty. But there must have been a better way.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:06.240
It didn't feel like there was. What about free will? Where was my free will?

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:15.240
I need to fix this. How can I? How can I keep my father from finding out what I've done?

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:21.240
What if? What if I didn't do my duty at the well today?

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:27.240
Just to see what the spirit will do. If the curse will really fall.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:35.240
Maybe if the curse falls, whatever it is, in all the confusion, Rodri won't tell my father about me.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:44.240
Or maybe Rodri will die. Or my father will die. Or will I die? After all, I've nothing to lose.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:52.240
That night, Rodri tells the King about Mereyd's treachery. It doesn't help him. The King just sends him back to prison.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.240
And then he thinks about his daughter.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:08.240
Hmm. What a sly little thing you've turned out to be. I guess I should have seen it coming. You've always resented me.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:16.240
Carrying your buckets again this evening, are you? They must be heavier than ever today. Do you feel your back begin to break?

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:21.240
The weight of all that guilt? The tears and pain you've brought to my people?

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:30.240
Well, you forced my hand. When you've finished your duties tonight, I will have my soldiers seize you. I will punish you.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:37.240
But in fact, that evening, as Mereyd heads to the river, she isn't carrying any heavy buckets at all.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:43.240
She's only pretending to. Has only pretended to fill her buckets with water at the sacred well.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.240
And plans to fake emptying them, just to see what will happen.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:55.240
To see if the spirit will notice what the spirit will do, if anything, if a curse will fall.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:13:15.240
Well, that night, whether it is the spirit's doing or not, the ancient sacred well of Cantiguaulod erupts,

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:38.240
shooting a sky-high jet of water into the air, sending an endless tower of water upwards, filling the sky, which then smashes back down onto the ground and floods the land.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.240
What have I done?

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:46.240
So there's me having a nice pint inside my local, and I ain't moved for a while.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.240
And all of a sudden I hear outside, we're flooding!

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.240
Then I see water starting to go up the pub walls.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:59.240
And then the next minute, I see this cow floating past the window.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.240
And I'm just standing there holding my pint.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:06.240
And then they're all coming in screaming and shouting.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:12.240
Grandad! Grandad, where are you? Oh, you silly old wretch!

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.240
Come on, Grandad, you have to get out of here!

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.240
And the next minute I've got water in my wellies.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:23.240
Grandad, this soaks! We have to go or we'll drown!

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:32.240
Aye, I've got wet feet, but I'm not moving until I finish this pint. I am staying here until I finish what I've started.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.240
And that is the end of Cantergwellod.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.240
We'd like to think they all escaped.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:50.240
Mererid, her father, King Gwyfnor, Prince Rodri, and especially Suan.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.240
And Mabon with his pint of Guinness.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.240
But we'll never know for sure.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.240
All we do know is that in both versions of the legend,

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.240
submerged beneath the Irish Sea in Cardigan Bay.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:08.240
Although they do say you can hear a bell ringing sometimes from beneath the waves.

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:15.240
But the War of the Well is our favourite version of the legend.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.240
With a bit of imaginative detail added by...

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:22.240
The Bliner, you are now in the Royal Castle.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.240
And you are now in the Royal Castle.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.240
And you are now in the Royal Castle.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.240
And you are now in the Royal Castle.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.240
And you are now in the Royal Castle.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.240
With a bit of imaginative detail added by...

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.240
The Bliner, you shed.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.240
We are.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.240
You shed.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.240
We are.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.240
We are.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.240
You shed.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.240
We are.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.240
You shed.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.240
We are.

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.240
You shed.
