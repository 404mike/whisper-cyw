00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.960
My name is Andrew Podnor aka Podinton Norr. I started going to gigs when I was 15 in 85, 86.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:27.720
I sing or shout or attempt to get a message over whilst playing with an amazing band called Bosch.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:37.720
It's been around for 20 years. My relationship with the music scene in Newport is well, I mean it's a little odd.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.720
I've never really felt like that I was necessarily connected to any of it.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:53.120
I always looked too old for my age, you know. I was quite a tall teenager and I looked old for my age.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.120
Something that benefited me when I was younger but doesn't pay many dividends as one gets older.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.120
However, you know, it meant that I could go and see gigs a lot sooner than most people were allowed to.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.120
They didn't even ask for ID back then and the first venue I frequented was TJ's.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:18.120
I think the first gig I went to see was the Membranes and I think the Abs were supporting and that was a particularly good night.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:31.120
During the period when TJ's was open from say 85, 86 till 97, 98, I frequently went to TJ's to see the bands

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:40.120
because like you know Simon had the cheap, sweaty, fun sort of events and he had an astonishing taste for new and interesting

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:48.120
like some alt rock and punk music flooding in from America and Europe and it was a real education.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:59.120
Then like you know things got a bit like sort of homogenized and Simon fell out with Johnny Sicolo over something or other.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:09.120
The other promoters weren't quite as imaginative as Simon was and I started spending less time going to gigs

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:15.120
and more time thinking about generating or being involved in a band that would create gigs.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.120
So that was a catalyst.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.120
Seeing Swans was particularly amazing.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:30.120
They were so loud and they were so beautifully bleak in their soundscapes

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:42.120
and they generated such an immensely emotive pull with their audience that you were just flabbergasted that a band could be that powerful.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.120
It wasn't a mosh pit.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:55.120
People tended to sway and whilst they were swaying we noticed that there was a patina of foam appearing on the dance floor at our feet

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:08.120
and then we looked up and we found out that like the noise was so loud that it was dismantling the foam cave facade of TJ's.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.120
And that was a fascinating gig.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.120
That's the one that really sticks in my mind.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:21.120
I'll tell you what though, it did highlight the fact that like you know the whole thing was kind of principally an illusion

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:37.120
right down to the Gothic majesty of Swans music and it made me start to think along the lines of music being a formula to control the audience.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:45.120
Well there were a lot of middle aged men which was odd because I was in my early 20s at the time and I thought wow you know.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:55.120
Naturally you were shocked that something this magnificent could attract so many different age groups.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:07.120
But as I got older I started to realize that like you know it was only through acquiring a knowledge of music and then dismantling that knowledge and wanting more

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.120
that you have these amazing moments with a band.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.120
A band that like you know might not necessarily attract young audiences.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.120
The Swans are notorious for their misanthropy and their negativity.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:32.120
I've got to admit being a 50 year old middle aged man has led me to believe that like you know the 50 year old middle aged men that were watching Swans

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.120
were really getting something quite special out of that experience.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:46.120
Like an attempt to deconstruct the residual and gradual trauma of their lives with sound.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.120
It was a psychically eventful evening it was beautiful.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.120
Yes it was crammed. It was crammed.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:05:00.120
I don't think John was particularly happy though because like you know the band did almost sonically destroy his venue.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.120
Which was hilarious.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:12.120
That was probably 1987, 88 maybe.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:27.120
It's difficult to tell because all of those gigs that I went to see they kind of blur into one and I've never been that interested in calendar dates and unlocking down on specific experiences

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:35.120
and remembering them in that fashion because I can't remember the day that it kind of happened or the night it happened.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:41.120
It's still fresh in my mind almost as if I'm still there you know.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.120
I can't remember who supported them.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:53.120
I cannot remember to this day who supported the Swans because I think I missed the support act because we tended to traditionally go to the

00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:08.120
the riverside tavern and have a few pints there and of course like a few pints back then when you were below drinking age but looked older was a hell of a draw.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.120
It was an act of rebellion to drink in that manner.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:20.120
So my friend Austin and I would go over there and get tanked up and then pop over and check out the main act generally.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:31.120
So I think we might have missed who supported Swans on that apocryphal night but they were amazing.
