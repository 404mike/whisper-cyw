00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880
So coming back to the physical relationship,

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.520
so you were saying that it's not really

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.680
an important part of relationship for you.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.360
It is for a lot of people, it's a lot of people.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.840
What about other, not necessarily just sex,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.560
but kind of more intimacy, other kind of things,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.480
kind of hugging.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.680
Oh, right, yeah, I'm definitely a culture,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.760
definitely a culture, no doubt about it.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.760
I'm very often, my kind of move in it

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.200
is just sat in the house, having a glass of wine

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.200
with my partner, having a candle, watching Netflix.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.600
That's kind of my ideal night in wealth.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.760
And did you get opportunity to do that

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.480
with previous partners?

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.000
Where would that happen if you were gonna do that?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.720
So a couple of my exes have been fully independent,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.480
so I've kind of gone over their ears.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.440
I cannot cock to save my life.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.800
So she didn't feel like cocking

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.600
because she was in college all day,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.920
so I said, oh, let's just have a Chinese.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.200
So we've kind of done that.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.440
So just little things like that.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.480
Would you stay over at hers or?

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.720
No. No.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.520
Have you ever stayed over with a partner?

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.480
No.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.480
And what's the reason for that then?

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.760
Reason is, I don't know why.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.880
This is gonna sound daft, but I've always said,

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.000
and I'm gonna stick to it, that I won't sleep over

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.720
until I'm at least 35, 36.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.560
Because by then I would have rather thought, right,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.840
I'll know I would have had a job that I know is secure

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.200
and maybe finance, financial-wise,

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.640
I know I could do it.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.480
So is that living completely independent?

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.640
Yeah, that's living independent.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.960
But just staying over, I think it's just confidence.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.040
I think it's a problem.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.240
So even for one night, you wouldn't feel comfortable?

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.080
No.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.360
What about going to a hotel together or anything like that?

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.200
Have you ever done that?

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.800
No, wouldn't happen.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.040
And no one stayed at yours?

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.480
No.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.680
So I've stayed over at hers until quite late,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.240
not a Chinese, and then come home at like,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.400
lend the clock, but sleeping over, no.
