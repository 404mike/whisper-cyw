00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640
So while you were still, before you were engaged, how sort of freely could you come and go with each other's lives and apartments?

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:16.240
We had a KFU. We could come and go during the day. Mealtimes were separate.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.000
If there was Christmas, can you remember what we had to do?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.200
We had to ask.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:36.720
Oh, we had to get permission for one of us to go over to the other person's unit in order to have dinner together.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.440
I think that was purely for the menu sake as well.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:58.720
The only time Steve could stay past 12, or past 11 in my room was either Christmas or birthdays or funerals.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.520
Did they explain why?

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.120
Fire regulations.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.320
Steve, how did you feel about that?

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.760
I wasn't very happy at first.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.080
At first we were told 9 o'clock.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:30.960
Yeah, that's true. 9 o'clock was the KFU, which was a little bit steep really when you consider you didn't finish your meals till around about 6, even half past on some occasions, which didn't give you a lot of time in the evening.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.520
Especially when you were looking for somebody because they're really busy in here.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.080
So then Steve was looking for somebody to try and get him over to mine.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.720
So sometimes we were only having hours together.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.400
How did you feel about that, Charlotte?

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.000
Angry.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.600
So they said it was fire regulations?

00:01:49.600 --> 00:02:01.600
What happened originally was one of the people at work in one of the units went to one of the managers and said they're both adults.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.640
They have a right to have a bit more time.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:15.840
So it was thankful to a good person who stood up for us.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.600
And then it got extended to past 11.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.560
Do you think because they're not experienced in supporting relationships?

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.960
It may well be because there aren't any, there isn't anybody else at this time like us.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:47.280
And when we first got together, I don't know if you remember, but I do, being told they were trying to discourage married people.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.480
Whether that is something to do with insurance, I don't know.
