WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
And I'm just going to say at the top of the tape that I'm Marcia Marnie and I'm with Margaret

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.220
Prosser and I can't see the name of your farm.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.220
What's the name of the farm?

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.220
Croynant.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.220
C-R-Y-N-A-N-G.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.220
Croynant Farm and it's Rudry.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.220
Rudry?

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.220
Yes.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.220
Near Cuffilly.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.220
Near Cuffilly.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.220
I thought we were near Cuffilly.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.220
Yes.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.120
And it is Friday, September the 6th, 2019.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.120
So I'm just going to pop that down there.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.120
When we were coming over the hill I could see, I thought, are we near Cuffilly?

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.120
I couldn't believe it.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.120
I didn't think we were that close.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.120
Yes, you came up this road here.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.120
Yes.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.120
So you're looking across there.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.360
It's a different perspective because it's gorgeous looking across the levels there,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.360
isn't it?

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.360
Yes, yes it is.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.360
Yes, yes, yes.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.120
And then when you get on the top there you can see Clevedon Pier.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.120
Really?

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.120
That's amazing.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.120
I might have to come back when it's a clearer day.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.120
Yes, that's right.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.120
It's not so clear today.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.120
I suppose we've had a rain this morning and that makes it more limited, won't you?

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.120
Have you met Marjorie Neale?

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.120
Yes, I've met Marjorie.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.120
Yes, yes.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.120
Are you related to her?

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.120
No, no, we're great friends.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.120
Oh really?

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.120
We're from a young farmer's days.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.120
Oh crikey.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.120
Yes, yes, yes.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.120
Oh, yeah, everyone's, it's so lovely.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.120
Everyone, I have to say Margaret, everyone I've met have been just adorable and so open

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.120
and welcoming.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.120
It's just so lovely.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.120
Yes.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.120
It's not so much easier.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.120
Because Marjorie was born there on the moors.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.120
Yeah.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.120
She was born there.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.120
Would you know Steph Davis?

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.120
Oh, what's her maiden name?

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.120
I can't think of her maiden name now.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.120
She was born at Lower Newton House, I think.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.120
Stephanie.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.120
Stephanie.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.120
I can't think of her name now.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.120
I'll think of it.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.120
But I wonder if we can just start off, if you could just tell us when you were born

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.120
and where you were born.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.120
I was born at 31 Herbert Avenue, Riska.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:11.120
As I say, my mother was a farmer's daughter and my father worked in the steelworks, you

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.120
know.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.120
And we moved from there then to Park Places, Riska.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.120
And we lived there for quite a few years.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.120
And then we moved from there then and took the farm at Langhorst.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.120
And that was 19...

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.120
Oh dear, 1946, 47.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.120
That's right.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:39.120
And then I moved back down then to Sluson in 1956 when I married Dewan.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.120
So what was your father's name?

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.120
William Benjamin Thomas.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.120
And your mother?

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.120
Minnie Harris.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.120
Oh, that's nice.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.120
Minnie.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.120
So your father worked in the steelworks?

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.120
Yes, yes.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.120
Where?

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.120
In Pontymester Steelworks, which is not there at the moment.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.120
That was taken down some years ago.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.120
Was that in Newport?

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.120
Riska.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.120
Pontymester Riska.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.120
So he wasn't a farmer at all?

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.120
No, no, no.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.120
And then he had his sister, Evelyn Mary Thomas.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.120
And she was 44 years in Riska at a radio in a natural gas shop.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.120
And then his other sister, Auntie Phyllis, Phyllis Thomas, she was a teacher.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.120
And up in Abercarne.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.120
And they lived in...

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.120
Oh, I've got to think of the name of the place now.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.120
Oh dear, that's terrible.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.120
They lived in Woodland Drive in Rogerstone.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.120
I don't know whether you know that area, do you?

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.120
No, I don't.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.120
Do you know Riska at all?

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.120
Not very well at all, though.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.120
You don't?

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.120
No, no, you go up through Woodland Drive, Rogerstone, up to Riska.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.120
And then of course you carry on up the valley then.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.120
So your mother was from a farming background?

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.120
Yes, yes.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.120
And where was she from?

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.120
Newhouse Farm, Pontyg, near Pontypool.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.120
Okay.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.120
Well Newin it was, really.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.120
So how did she meet your father?

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:05.120
Well I think my grandparents on my mother's side, father's side, lived in Newin.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.120
And I think my dad used to go back and forth, you know, to see them.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.120
And that's how they met, I suppose.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.120
It's funny how people do meet, don't they?

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.120
So your father had to learn how to be a farmer then, seemingly.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.120
Yes, he was always interested.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.120
His cousin used to keep the Mardie Farm, Corkoonoo, just below the Corkoonoo Golf Course.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.120
Yes.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.120
And he spent a lot of time there.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.120
So that's, you know, he really got fed up with the, as the saying is, the stewardess.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.120
So he thought they'd branch out and they had this farming land course then.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.120
And we took that over Lock, Stock and Barrel.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.120
When they say Lock, Stock and Barrel, we took over the stock and rented the farm there.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.120
Okay.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.120
Yes.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.120
Land course.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.120
And I liked land course very much.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.120
We'd look out for the door and we could see the Pentagon.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.120
Oh, he had?

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.120
Yes.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.120
And 1947 was a winter.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.120
Oh, terrible.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.120
Was it really?

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.120
Oh, shocking, yes.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.120
I mean we had tremendous snow.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.120
The milk didn't go from there with the lorry for over a week.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.120
Wow.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.120
Because we were snowed up.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.120
Yeah.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.120
And then there was a camp of Italians at Bulk.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:20.120
And there was another, the Germans in, Italian, German soldiers in Brecon.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.120
And they cut through really.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.120
Yes.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.120
Amazing.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.120
Yes, it was, it was horrendous.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.120
So, and then I used to go to school in Brecon then from Land Gorse.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.120
Walk up to the hill.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.120
I used to hate school.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.120
I'd rather be home.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.120
Doing the work there.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.120
And I used to, I was a cyclist sometimes, but I'd walk at the times and I used to really

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.120
dode-lune out.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.120
And then I'd hear the train coming around from Talga to Brecon and stop at the Land

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.120
Gorse Halt.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.120
And I'd try to, but no, I never got there.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.120
Then I came home.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.120
And then my father said, look, you cannot do this, you see.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.120
You must, you have got to go to school.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.120
And I said, well, I don't like school.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.120
So I left when I was 15.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.120
So that was my story of schooling in Brecon.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.120
How old were you when your family moved down here?

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.120
When I say here, over there?

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.120
Oh, to Berry Hill.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.120
So where is Berry Hill?

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.120
It's on the main road.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.120
Go through Castleton.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.120
Yeah.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.120
To Newport.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.120
And before you get down to where there's a big walk over a bridge.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.120
Yes.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.120
Well, it's on the right-hand side.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.120
Oh, really?

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.120
Before you get there.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.120
Yes.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.120
It's not there now.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.120
Is it gone?

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.120
Is it all gone?

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.120
No, the farm is still there.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.120
Pick your own.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.120
But they haven't done that for some time now.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:43.120
And there's a bungalow that's built next to it, which the person that took over after

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.120
my mother and father finished, he was there for some time.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.120
Well, actually, who was there was Robert Peel.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.120
You know, Robert Peel, this is his grandson, but his name is Robert.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.120
Really?

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.120
Yes.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.120
Amazing.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.120
So why did your parents move from Langorce?

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.120
Why did they come here?

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:07.120
Well, because, well, it was a bit bigger farm, and we liked this area more because my parents,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.120
well, my father, particularly, moved from this area.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:15.120
And as I say, his cousin used to farm the farm down below, so there's quite a lot of,

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.120
you know, over there with them.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.120
And then, so did your parents move to Slough's Farm, or was that you?

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.120
No, I moved to Slough's Farm.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.120
I married from Berryhill, and married Dylwyn from Slough's Farm.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.120
So how did you meet Dylwyn?

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.120
Oh, Young Farmers.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:35.120
It's quite a, it's quite a matamorial place, isn't it?

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.120
Yes, Young Farmers, that we used to belong to.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.120
So was it very active then, Young Farmers?

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.120
Yes, we were, yes.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.120
St. Maren's Young Farmers, it went under.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.120
But I did belong to the Llynsefad and Young Farmers in Bracken, or Langorce, when I was there.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.120
And, yes, we were quite active, you know.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:58.120
Yes, we used to have some fun, different, go to different shows and so forth, you know.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.120
But, oh yes, it's quite a matamorial place, the Young Farmers, I think.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.120
Really?

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.120
Yes.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:10.120
I've heard that so many times, people who've met through, it must be an informal marriage bureau.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.120
Yes.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.120
Crikey.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.120
Oh yes, yes.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.120
So you met Dylwyn, and then he was already living at...

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.120
He was born down Slough's.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.120
He was born there.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.120
Yes, yes.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.120
And he's got two sisters.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.120
One is Betty, which is two years younger, older.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.120
And she's living in Gloucester.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.120
She's 19 now.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.120
And then the other sister lived at...

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.120
Did you see who met Derek?

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.120
Yes.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.120
Well, Derek's mother was his sister to Dylwyn.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.120
Oh, okay.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.120
Doreen.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.120
Yes.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.120
She died...

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.120
Oh, she wasn't very old.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.120
She was quite good cancer bad.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.120
Oh.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.120
And very sad it was.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.120
Yes.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.120
And that's why Derek...

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.120
So how have we met?

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.120
How did you come to meet Derek, excuse me, ask it?

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.120
Well, Derek and Andrew were both through John Souther, who worked for the drainage board.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.120
Ah, right.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.120
Yes.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.120
Yes, he's a chap that goes round cleaning them and talking to all the landowners and

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.120
stuff.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.120
So John introduced me to...

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.120
He said, you've got to speak to Derek and Andrew Prosser.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.120
Oh.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.120
So that...

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.120
And then that's why I'm here now.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.120
Yes.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.120
Yes.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.120
Very grateful to him.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.120
Yes.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.120
Well, my father Prosser, he was on the drainage board, and he was supposed to lend us different

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.120
meetings and that, you know.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.120
So that's, um, Dew Wynne's father.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.120
It's her.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.120
So what was his full name?

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.120
Wynneford.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.120
Wynneford Prosser.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.120
Wynneford Prosser.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.120
So what...

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.120
And his wife was living at Lansoy.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.120
And I don't know what they met.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:40.120
Um, let me see, I think, I think Dew Wynne's father had a housekeeper.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:47.120
And then, um, my mother-in-law Marjorie, she was Marjorie, she came down to meet her.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:52.120
And then they seemed to get friendly and then they married, you see.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.120
Yes, Lansoy.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.120
Lansoy at the side desk.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.120
So what was, um, sorry, what was his name?

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.120
Wynneford.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.120
Wynneford.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.120
Wynneford.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.120
So he was on the drainage board, you see.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.120
Yes, yes.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.120
And Dew Wynne was on the drainage board.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.120
Yes.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.120
So I'm getting confused.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.120
So Wynneford is Dew Wynne's father.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.120
That's right.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.120
So Wynneford was on the drainage board.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:17.120
So what can you tell me about Dew Wynne's parents on the farm?

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:25.120
Well, Dew Wynne's dad, Wynneford, has got a brother, I'll show you photographs of

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.120
them afterwards.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.120
Campbell Prosser, he was a barrister-in-law.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.120
And he was out abroad for a long time, Singapore.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.120
Really?

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:37.120
And then he had a sister, which I've got the photograph, the whole family's up there,

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.120
you can see later on.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:46.120
And then he had a sister that lived in Cardiff Road.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:51.120
And then, you see Campbell.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.120
And then there was Dew Wynne who was killed in the war, first World War.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.120
And that was Wynneford.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.120
Well, I'll have to, I can show you the photograph.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.120
It's on the wall, so it's easy for you to have a look at it on the wall, really.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:10.120
So that was, that was Dew Wynne's father's side, you see.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.120
And they had butcher shops in Cardiff, Clifton Street.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.120
Yes.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.120
There was a big butchery in there.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.120
And that was their business, more or less, you know.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.120
So, butchery shop.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.120
Yes.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.120
Butcher shop.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.120
So when did the farm come into the...

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:31.120
Well, Wynneford, he wasn't keen on the butchery shop, so he went farming then.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.120
So he took over, took sluice and rented sluice.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.120
Oh, right.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.120
And then, of course, the milk.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.120
And then they used to have a milk round with a milk van and everything.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.120
And Dew Wynne used to go occasionally when his father had a meeting up in London, but

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:50.120
he wasn't so keen on the milk round.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:54.120
But he used to do it when his father had to go to London for meetings with the drainage

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.120
port and that, you know.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.120
So why did they have meetings in London?

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.120
I don't know, really.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.120
And of course they used to have the meetings out at Magad, didn't they?

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.120
Yeah.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.120
That's the place.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.120
Is it Magad?

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.120
Yes, Magad, isn't it?

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.120
They used to have the...

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.120
Oh, Nash.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.120
Nash, rather.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.120
That's right.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.120
Pie Corner.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.120
That's right, Pie Corner.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.120
Yeah.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.120
Yes, Nash.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.120
Yes, yeah.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.120
So...

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.120
So was it always a dairy farm then, the sluice farm?

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.120
Yes, yes.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.120
Yes, they had cows and everything.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.120
And sheep.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.120
And then we moved up here later.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.120
And then they moved there, but then they went out to the cows.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.120
And so the Andros only got the sheep at the moment.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.120
So then you met Dilwyn.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.120
Three young farmers.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.120
Three young farmers.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.120
And so where did you marry, actually?

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.120
In Coorkean O'Church.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.120
Oh, did you?

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.120
It's a dear little church, yes.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.120
Yeah.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.120
It's a house now that's been turned into...

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.120
Yes, Coorkean...

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.120
Do you know...

00:12:53.120 --> 00:13:00.120
Well, you know the main one I said about with this article is you're turned down for Coorkean

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.120
O'Church for the golf course.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.120
Yes.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.120
And it's just before you get to the golf course.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.120
Or just after the golf course, sorry.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.120
On the right.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.120
On the left-hand side you've got a little lane up to the church.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.120
Really?

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.120
Oh, I don't think I've been to the church.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.120
Oh, I don't think...

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.120
It's a house now.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.120
It's...

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.120
Was it a chapel then?

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.120
Or was it a chapel?

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.120
No, a church.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.120
Really?

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.120
Yeah, Coorkean O'Church.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.120
Oh, I have to go back that way afterwards.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.120
I might go and have a look.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.120
Yes, yes, yes.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.120
I had no idea.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.120
And I think there's three or four houses there.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:32.120
Because there was a farm next to it but they've gone into homesteads, you see.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:36.120
So then, so did you then start your married life at Soos Farm?

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.120
Yes.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.120
You moved in with your in-laws?

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.120
Yes.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.120
No, no, they moved, they built a house.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.120
Do you see the house on the side there?

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.120
Yes.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.120
They built that.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:50.120
And then we went into the farmhouse and they built that and went into there.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.120
So this would have been, what, the mid-50s?

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.120
Yes, 57.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.120
57?

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.120
Yes.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.120
So, erm, so what was the farm doing then?

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.120
Was it...

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.120
Er, milk.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.120
Milk.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.120
Milk and milk round.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.120
Yeah.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.120
Yeah, and they'd fill the bottles, you know, and wash the bottles in and in the little

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.120
shed that was there.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.120
Yeah.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.120
That's erm...

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.120
Yes, I think I've got a photograph here.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.120
Excuse me.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.120
How many cows did you have, Margaret?

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.120
How many cows did you have?

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.120
Er, well not like they've got today, they've got hundreds today, haven't they?

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.120
Yeah.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.120
But they've really been 125.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.120
But that's still...

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.120
Which is quite, you know, big for those days, I suppose, wasn't it?

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.120
Yeah.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.120
Nice to get a photograph here, I think, aren't they?

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.120
Yeah.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.120
And that wasn't all hand-milked, was it?

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.120
Was that all milked by hand?

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:45.120
Well, it was years ago and then they went in with the machines then, you know.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.120
This is a photograph of Slough's house.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.120
This was before 1963.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.120
That's where it was when I used to live there, you see.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.120
Oh, crikey.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.120
There was a milk van right there.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.120
Yeah.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.120
A dairy there where they used to wash the bottles.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.120
Yeah.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.120
Cows used to go into there.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.120
Yeah.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.120
And then this was the garden.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.120
I mean, Anne's got a beautiful garden down there now.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.120
Wow.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.120
And then there was just a shed where we kept chickens.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.120
Yes.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.120
Erm, so it all altered, of course, because all this is buildings, you know.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.120
This has all changed, hasn't it?

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.120
Yeah, all definitely.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.120
I mean, it's all built up.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.120
Yes.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.120
Very rural then.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.120
Yes, yes, yes.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.120
It was.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.120
Crikey.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.120
And then in this wheelchair, which was his own, that's where they built the house.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.120
You can see Wyvern.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.120
Oh.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.120
You know, they built that there.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:33.120
Did they build that because Dilwyn was getting married?

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.120
Yes, yes.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.120
They built that to go in there.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:40.120
And erm, oh, but I was only thinking the other day.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.120
I think it was about 90.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.120
Oh, I've forgotten the money.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:48.120
I'm not sure I was thinking about how much it cost the other day.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:53.120
The bridge cost me more to get across the reed to get to the house than the house, I think.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.120
Really?

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.120
Yes, it was.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.120
You forget about that, don't you?

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.120
Yes, you do.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.120
You have to get across the reed.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.120
That's true.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.120
Yes, yes.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:04.120
So what were your first impressions when you moved down there and started married life?

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:08.120
Erm, well, I used to go back and forth there before we were actually married, you know,

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.120
and have supper and things with Mother-in-law and that.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:18.120
And erm, yes, well I liked it very much because we had ground with Berry Hill.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.120
We had two fields on the moors, as we call them.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.120
Okay, yes.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:28.120
We rented those and erm, so it wasn't any different for me really, you know.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.120
Yeah.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.120
And then of course we used to go to Young Farmers there.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.120
We used to go to Young Farmers Club in St Melons.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.120
Did you?

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.120
Yes, yes.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.120
In the chapel there, I used to hold the Young Farmers meetings.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.120
Yeah.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.120
But erm, oh yes.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.120
So I enjoyed life.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.120
So you were a farmer's wife.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:49.120
So I've spoken to lots of farmers and erm, so as a farmer's wife, would you, would you

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:54.120
have been aware of and concerned with all the reams and the maintenance and stuff?

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:59.120
I mean, I guess what I'm trying to ask is, was there very much a clear, this was what

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.120
the woman did and this is what the men did, or was it all mixed up?

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:10.120
Well I think, I used to enjoy going out and feeding calves and things and that, you know.

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:14.120
And then when I was born, we used to put him in the plan, put him in the corner of the

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:19.120
milking shed and he'd be sat there, you know, watching the cows coming in and out and all

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.120
that.

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:24.120
And before we had a parlour that was, the milking parlour type of thing, you know, where

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.120
you could get up and in and mushing.

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:30.120
But erm, yeah, I've always been, I've always been interested outside.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:35.120
Because I used to spend quite a bit of time before we went to Langhorst with my grandparents

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.120
at Newhouse Farm, Pantague.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.120
Yeah.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.120
You know, just go out there and stay when I was a little tot, you know.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:46.120
Put me on the bus and you put my aunt with me, me and you in.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.120
How lovely.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.120
Yeah.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.120
So did you ever get involved in the bottling of milk down there?

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:56.120
I used to have sometimes, and that helped, erm, my father probably used to, you know,

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.120
mostly he'd do that.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.120
I'd have to come back off the road.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:04.120
And then wash the bottles and get them ready then to fill up the next morning.

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.120
You know, it's, erm, yeah.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.120
Oh yes.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:11.120
Oh yes, I've had a very enjoyable life really.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.120
You can tell that, it shows in your face.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.120
It's lovely.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.120
Yeah, it does.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.120
What about the poultry?

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.120
Was that an important part of the family?

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:23.120
Yeah, we used to sell eggs on the milk farm quite a lot, you know.

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:28.120
And then if there was any surplus eggs then, I used to bring them to the husband brothers

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:36.120
who used to have, erm, well, I don't know, what do you call it, an egg centre that they

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.120
would have eggs and then they'd take them out on different rounds.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.120
Where were the husband brothers based?

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.120
It's, erm, Lisbon.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.120
Oh really?

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.120
Yes, yes.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.120
But that's all different now altogether.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.120
You know, places change, don't they?

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.120
Yeah.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:55.120
Well it's interesting, look at the new photograph, because you must have seen enormous change

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.120
in your lifetime down there.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:02.120
Oh yes, yeah, especially now, more buildings up for stock and everything, you know.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.120
Yeah.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:07.120
And, erm, I mean I used to try and keep it well clean, tidy and all this business.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.120
And we used to have a boy living in then, you see.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.120
Did you?

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:15.120
Yes, yes, you know the, erm, excuse me, you know the kitchen.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.120
You're going for the back door, don't you?

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.120
Well that's the dining room, the kitchen for every day.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.120
Yeah.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.120
Then there's the kitchen, isn't there?

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.120
Yeah.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.120
Then there's the other room.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.120
We used to have a boy living in there.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.120
Did you?

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:30.120
Yes, yeah, and he had his bed in there and there was a stove in the corner.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.120
We used to have for the fire and he had an armchair.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.120
Yeah.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.120
He always ate with us.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.120
Yeah.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.120
And, erm, yes, so we always had a boy living in.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.120
And who was he?

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.120
Was it a series of people or?

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:48.120
Erm, well yes, different, we had a few from St. Brides that didn't live in, they came

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.120
back and forth, which is, you know, from Cocoonia.

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:57.120
But a couple of, they actually lived in there, you know, with us and they'd eat with us and

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.120
all this business, you know.

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:03.120
But, erm, I mean he had a television, well not a television, a wireless one, but he did

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.120
have a television towards the end.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.120
And, erm, yes, we always had a boy living in.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:13.120
I suppose the farm could support that, whereas it would be difficult to do that today, wouldn't

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.120
it?

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:18.120
Well I suppose, yes, it's different, it's the different ideas today, isn't it?

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.120
Yeah.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.120
Different world today, really.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.120
It's a strange lot to really be farming, isn't it?

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.120
But did you have sheep then?

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:32.120
Yes, we had some sheep, yeah, pet lambs and something, you know, feed those and, yes,

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:36.120
I can't remember how many sheep, we didn't have so many sheep as well, no, naturally,

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.120
because we had the dairying as well, you see.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:46.120
It's, erm, yes, oh yes, I've enjoyed my life up until now.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:51.120
So Antem used to go up onto the seawall and bring the sheep in on ponies.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.120
Yes.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.120
Did you ever get involved with that?

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.120
No, not really, no, no.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:04.120
Yes, we'd put sheep over on the seawall and then, erm, Doreen, Derek's father, Philip,

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:09.120
would come over and he'd have this horse and a little trap thing, you know, and they'd

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:13.120
sit in there and then they'd go up then to get onto the horse and to bring the sheep

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.120
up and all this business, you know.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:20.120
And then one day, erm, I don't know what happened, but anyhow, the pony started kicking

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:25.120
the bottom of the possum and of course got out of the, out of the showers and left these

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:30.120
four or five of them and the possum went backwards while it was suffering.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.120
What, backwards down the slope?

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.120
Well, it went back, it went back, back, you know.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.120
Oh, I see, because the horse had gone.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.120
There were the showers hanging over them.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.120
Were they OK?

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:44.120
Well, they were all right and the dog jumped out a bit quick and the dog was in as well.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:49.120
Oh, OK, yeah, they used to come over every Sunday and go down and see the sheep and all

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:52.120
sorts of those, I don't know, pretty much.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.120
Because the sheep used to graze on the other side of it.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.120
Yes, yes, hmm, hmm.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.120
So.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:01.120
Until, like, erm, the tide used to come in so far, you know.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.120
Yeah.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:06.120
But they hired the, erm, I think they hired the bank then.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:12.120
Erm, yes, they did hire it because of course the sea, the water was coming, the sea was

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.120
getting in higher, wasn't it, you know.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.120
Because you're very close to the seawall there, aren't you?

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.120
Oh, yes, it's only the field really, isn't it?

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.120
Yes.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:21.120
The field across.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.120
Did you ever experience the water coming over?

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:27.120
You see it sometimes if it was very rough, just splashing up a bit, you know.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:33.120
But, erm, you know, I never had the thought in mind of thinking, oh gosh, I hope it doesn't

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.120
come over there.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.120
I never thought of that.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.120
No.

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.120
Which I suppose it does.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.120
It has, well, it has in some places over the years, hasn't it, you see.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.120
Do you ever use the shore where the sheet grates?

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.120
Is there like a picnic spot when you had children when they were little?

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:52.120
Yeah, we used to go over there and, erm, like, a lot of the, have you been over there?

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.120
You've been over there, of course.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.120
Hmm.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.120
I haven't been over there for years really, so I don't know what it's like.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.120
But we used to have little, little, what's the name of the water coming in?

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.120
Where there's been bits and digits.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.120
Yeah, like rivulets.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.120
Yes, yes, yes.

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.120
Hmm.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.120
Yeah, yes, we used to go over there with our neighbours.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.120
Edinsons Neckardt Farm, Slough's Farm that would be.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.120
The one just on the side of the road.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:20.120
And, yes, we'd go over there for picnics and, er, yeah, we used to have a, you know, now

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.120
and again have a good time.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:30.120
Was it, was it, erm, er, was there a real sense of community there then?

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:34.120
Er, down the village, yeah, erm, even the village itself.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.120
Yeah.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:41.120
Oh yes, because those, those opposite the hall, those are all built, you see, erm, because

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:45.120
when I went down there first there was no houses there then, you know, so they'd been

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.120
built and at the back of the hall is a little cul-de-sac.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.120
Yeah.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.120
That's the council houses further over.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.120
They were, they were there when I went down.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.120
Hmm.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.120
And different houses had been built around there, you know.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:03.120
Yes, oh it's nice to live, I've been, I'm quite upset really because WI had been a

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.120
member for 62 years down there.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.120
Have you?

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.120
Yes.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.120
And, er, I used to take my mother-in-law because she didn't drive, Deryn's mother

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.120
didn't drive.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:17.120
So, and then after lunch we'd go down on the, er, the second Tuesday of the month, I used

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.120
to pick her up and we'd go down, because she was president at that time, and there was

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:26.120
the back, the old black stove, I don't know if you've seen the old black stove, it was

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.120
like that.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.120
In the village hall?

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.120
In the village hall.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:34.120
And then put the chairs and tables up, and then go back then and I'd pick her up then

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.120
at the tea then to go to WI.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.120
And, er, yes we did that for years.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:43.120
Erm, and then I used to have the milk van then, I had the milk van for a couple of,

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:49.120
oh for about a week or more in the afternoons, to go to, er, a place in Bremne to get a

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.120
sanding machine.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:55.120
And, er, put in the back there and come, and then redo the floor, you know, sand, get the

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.120
floor all nice and, well, slim you know.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.120
Yeah?

00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.120
Oh, we've had some good times down there.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.120
Really good times.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:05.120
So somebody was telling me that St. Price WI used to have a canning machine.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.120
Yes.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.120
Do you know about that?

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:09.120
Yes, yes, and Mother Prosser had it.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.120
Now where it is I don't know.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.120
Yes, because we used to put fruit into our own canning.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.120
Yes.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.120
Hmm, hmm.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:21.120
I wonder where it is, er, now I, I've forgotten about that.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:25.120
I wonder where that is now.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:29.120
Yeah, now I wonder where that is.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.120
You've got me thinking now.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.120
Ha ha ha.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.120
I'll be trying to explore where it is.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:39.120
So would they, would the WI rent it out, or would they take it out to people and say,

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.120
do the canning for people?

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.120
Er, I couldn't, I wouldn't, I can't say that.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:48.120
I mean, erm, I know we used to borrow it and do our own.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:52.120
At least Mother Prosser did more than I did, but I'd give a hand, you know.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:56.120
But erm, that's interesting how you brought up that canning machine.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.120
I'm not going to bother you now.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.120
I'd be worried about that.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.120
Ha ha ha.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.120
It'd be lovely if it's still around somewhere.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.120
Yes.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.120
Yes, it would, wouldn't it?

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.120
And it's still going, the St. Brides WI?

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.120
St. Brides, no, no, it's folded up a long time ago.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.120
Oh really?

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.120
Yes, yes, yes.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.120
Oh, that's a shame.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:17.120
So a lot of the people from there now come to Peterstone, and this is why I'm rather

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.120
upset that Peterstone is talking about folding up.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.120
Oh.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:26.120
I mean, the secretary, she's moving away down to Swansea, well that's why I'm there.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:31.120
The president, she did say that she'd do it for another two years.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:35.120
Well, the two years has come up now, and no one else wants to take the responsibility.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.120
That's such a shame.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.120
It is a shame.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.120
It is a shame.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.120
And it's been going how long?

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.120
Well, I've been down there 62 years.

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.120
That's phenomenal, Margaret.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.120
And it was on a long time before that.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.120
Oh.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.120
Yes, it's sad really.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.120
How many members have you got down there?

00:26:50.120 --> 00:27:00.120
There's, from St. Brides area, around Asda, where people live, I expect there's 14 people

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.120
come from that area.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:07.120
And it seems such a shame that, you know, no one will take it on.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.120
After all that time?

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.120
Yeah, it is.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:15.120
Because I was president for about seven years after Mother Pross has given it up, I don't

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.120
know how long she was.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.120
But no, it's quite sad.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.120
I was quite upset about it really.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:28.120
But I'm hoping that I might join Kevin Madley, Michael Stoneman, which is nearer.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.120
Yeah.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:32.120
But the distance didn't make any difference to me.

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.120
It's a longevity though, isn't it?

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.120
Winds and weathers.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.120
Yeah.

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.120
Pick up a couple of ladies from Ashfield on the way down.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.120
Oh, how sweet.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.120
Yes, you just enjoy it.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.120
That's how it goes, isn't it?

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:47.120
So you said Mother Pross used to can fruit.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.120
Yes.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.120
Where did her fruit come from?

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.120
Oh, well, she had, we had plum trees.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:58.120
You know, we had trees, we had plum trees and we had a couple of trees around here.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.120
Yeah.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.120
Plum trees and things.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.120
And well, that was our garden then.

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.120
Yeah.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:08.120
You know, and then we'd have beans and stuff like that, you know, to roast it.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:14.120
But yeah, I've forgotten about that canning machine.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.120
So what was the process then?

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.120
So you'd pick the fruit and then wash it?

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.120
Yes.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.120
And then make a syrup.

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.120
Yeah.

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.120
And then put it in the tins.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.120
And then with the machine you'd seal it all.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.120
And that would be a tinned fruit.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.120
Gosh, and that would last all the winter?

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:35.120
Well, yes, if you know, you make as much as you can, you know, or we could.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:39.120
And yes, gosh, I'm glad you thought about the canning machine.

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.120
You've got me worried now.

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.120
Well, it's come up a few times, you see.

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.120
So I thought, I'm curious.

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.120
Yes.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.120
I've never heard of a canning machine before.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.120
And that St. Bride's WI has a canning machine.

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.120
It just sounds really resourceful to me.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.120
Yes, that's right.

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.120
Yes, yes.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.120
I wonder where that is now.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:07.120
Did the WI, because in the past the WI has been absolutely fantastic at recording local people and their memories,

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:11.120
did the St. Bride's WI ever do anything like that?

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:17.120
No, they folded up, as I said, and a couple of them came from there then, which are a few more now,

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:22.120
because the president it is now, she lives in one of the houses by our stairs.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.120
And of course a couple of her friends have come as well.

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:30.120
As I say, I was quite upset last week when I knew it was going to fold up.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.120
Oh, that is upsetting.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.120
Yes, it is.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.120
But there we are, people are not interested.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.120
You can't force people to be.

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.120
You can't.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.120
You can try and encourage.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:49.120
So as a young woman, a young wife, was it part of one's social life, the WI?

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.120
It was, really.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:55.120
Yes, I went up to London for the two AGMs.

00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:03.120
The WI was something that you did as a young wife, and you have continued to do for a long time.

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.120
Yes, yes, yes.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.120
Yes, I enjoyed WI.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:13.120
I went to London to the AGM on two occasions, which is up at the Albert Hall,

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:17.120
and that was very interesting, where they come from all over the country.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:20.120
It has gone back a bit.

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:25.120
But you know, what struck me about down on the moors there,

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.120
that it's quite a different landscape, isn't it?

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.120
It's flat, all the water courses.

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.120
Oh, yes, yes.

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.120
Was that a challenge in some way?

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:37.120
I don't know whether you were a friend, because there's people living in the church now,

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:44.120
the church was, and on about, what, what am I, five foot, am I five foot or nothing?

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:49.120
Except about, well, I should know the possible, where the Greek flood was.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.120
Yes, yes.

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:56.120
Yes, and the bank, you can see the bank, now we're one of the fields of one of the farms up,

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.120
as you go down the road a bit.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.120
Yes.

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:06.120
Yes, well, I think I'm right in saying, the water more or less came up nearly up to Cattleden.

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.120
Yeah, it was, yeah, because it goes down, doesn't it, apparently?

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.120
Yeah, yeah, it's very low, very low.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.120
Did you ever experience flooding there?

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:18.120
No, no, the rains would fill up quite a bit, you know, but no, no,

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.120
we never had any flooding as such, no.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:25.120
What was it like having young children around those things, though, was it ever a worry?

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:31.120
Oh, yes, yes, now the neighbours on that farm down to, what's the farm then,

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:36.120
they lost a child that drowned in the water.

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:42.120
And also, instant brides, the child drowned in some brides in the rain.

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.120
Oh, really?

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:46.120
Yes, yes, but I suppose you get,

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:50.120
I suppose if you're born down there, you get used to it.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:54.120
I know the one that came down, the one further on down the road,

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:58.120
was from London, came down to see the sister,

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:03.120
came down and brought the little one, of course, went down the steps and down to the rain there,

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.120
you know, which is very sad, very sad.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.120
Oh, gosh, that's so sad, isn't it?

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:10.120
Terrible, terrible. Yes, but...

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:15.120
When you first went to Sleuth's Farm, was there electricity and stuff?

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:20.120
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, because when I lived in Langorce, we had no electricity.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.120
No, no.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.120
I got the Aladdin lamp there, the hanging Aladdin lamp,

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:28.120
and I've got a little table lamp that's in there, that's with oil,

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:33.120
and we didn't have any hot water, cold water or anything like that.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:38.120
Can you talk about the winter of 47? What was the winter of 62, 63 like?

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.120
I was down here then, of course.

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.120
Oh, here?

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.120
Yes, yes, it was bad then.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:47.120
We used to go up to Castleton with the tractor

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:51.120
to have the lorry to come down, you know, to bring it down.

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.120
Really?

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:57.120
And then in the evenings, a couple of the locals there, the youngsters,

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:04.120
they'd take me down the six-pouse on a big boat, drag it down the road, you know.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:10.120
Oh, yes, we had quite a lot of snow. Yes, yes, yes, but we had more when we were in Langorce.

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:17.120
I remember seeing on Penavan, down one of the crevices in June, there was still snow.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.120
Really? My goodness. I can see that now.

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.120
It went on and on and on, didn't it?

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.120
Yes, it did, it did.

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:25.120
Did anyone ever go skating on the Reens or anything like that?

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:30.120
On the lake. Oh, sorry, on Langorce Lake they used to go, but I mean,

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:35.120
well, it was frozen over and a motorbike went across, and it's never known before.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.120
Really?

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.120
It went across the other side.

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.120
I've never heard that before.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:43.120
I think they did. Yes, I should say, but many did freeze, didn't they?

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.120
Yes.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:49.120
You know, it's just, and yeah, we used to go, we used to go and,

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:53.120
a crowd of us were really into Langorce, we used to take one of these little boats.

00:33:53.120 --> 00:34:00.120
We used to go down to the other side of Langorce, Langasty, and I don't know, even with Langorce.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:05.120
And if you look across there, there's a little hole, about three feet from the end of the river,

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:10.120
and Langorce, and we used to go across there to dances,

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:15.120
and we'd take one of these skiff boats, you know, and we used to row across there.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.120
Did you really?

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.120
Yeah.

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.120
That's quite some distance.

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:22.120
Yes, it was really, back when you were younger, I noticed distance too.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:23.120
I wonder now.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:28.120
And we used to tether it there and walk up these two or three years, go to the dance,

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.120
come back, then and row back.

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:34.120
My goodness, imagine if my daughter was doing that, I'd be, you know,

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.120
Yeah, or what we used to do.

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.120
Or what we used to do.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.120
Yeah, what we used to do then, years ago, when we were young.

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:45.120
Do you remember the, did you ever help with haymaking as a young farmer's wife?

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:50.120
Well, yes, dry the tractor perhaps and that, you know, the baling.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:56.120
And of course, we had a photograph, I don't know, I might have got a photograph here,

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:59.120
where, excuse me.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:02.120
What's this prize here then, Margaret?

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:08.120
Well, this is when I was first lady chairman of St. Mannon's show.

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:11.120
Now, that was a big show, someone said to me.

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:14.120
Oh yes, oh it was lovely, oh yes, fair play, it was.

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:18.120
I look forward to St. Mannon's show.

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.120
So is it a very strong farming community?

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:23.120
Is it a very close-knit farming community?

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.120
Yes, I think so, yes, yes.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.120
You know, we do a lot of things together.

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:36.120
We had two donkeys and this donkey down Slose and then we put her in foal

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:40.120
and oh, you've never seen such sweet things when this little one came.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.120
I think the whole village came down to see it.

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.120
Really?

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.120
Oh, just the deal thing.

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:48.120
Someone told me that farmers kept donkeys because they were good luck.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:54.120
Well, yes, they were, a lot of people had donkeys with a cattle.

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.120
Hmm, I've never heard that before.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:01.120
Yes, yes, I don't know whether it's, oh there's the, I spent it this hand,

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.120
little one, Tangle.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.120
Wow.

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:08.120
This was in 1955 when I saw my sheep and I bought the little sports car.

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.120
Is that you?

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:14.120
Yeah, no, that's not me, that's my mother and my aunt, but that's the little car I bought.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.120
You bought it?

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.120
Yes, I saw the sheep and I bought the little car.

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:20.120
Oh, I think that's so impressive.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:23.120
That must have been very unusual for a young woman there.

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:27.120
Oh, yeah, we used to have some fun, we used to go following the hounds.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.120
Did you?

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:37.120
Yes, on the top there and yeah, and then one day walking back to the car and here comes the local policeman with a steering wheel in his hand.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.120
He took the steering wheel off.

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.120
Why?

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:43.120
I went to Blackpool in that and back.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:46.120
Oh my goodness, you and me, what sort of car is it?

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:51.120
It was built up among the Singer, it was a Singer engine.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.120
I am so impressed with you.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.120
Oh my goodness.

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:57.120
And then you followed the hounds down on the moors?

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.120
Yes, yeah.

00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.120
Really?

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.120
Derek was telling me about that.

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.120
Yes, yes, the Shrediga Hunt.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.120
Oh, so where would you go?

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:11.120
And the Shrediga Hunt was based in Beyslech, but it's all been built on now.

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.120
Yeah?

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:16.120
So they've gone up to Gelligeir, the hounds up there.

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:17.120
Yeah.

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:21.120
So, I mean, we use them if we have dead stock or something.

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.120
Yeah.

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:26.120
We pay so much a year for them to pick it up, to take it up to the year, us, them, you know.

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.120
But then you would follow them in your car, would you?

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.120
Yeah.

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.120
And who would you do that with?

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.120
On the top of Penelan, I don't know, Penelan.

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.120
Yeah.

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.120
Up there, we'd be up there.

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:36.120
That's like an orchard there.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.120
Yes, yeah, we used to have trees.

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.120
So did you get apples off those as well?

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.120
Yes, apples and pears.

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.120
Did you ever make cider from them?

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.120
No, no, but we used to can them.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.120
Can them?

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.120
Gosh, that's lovely.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.120
So where was the orchard then?

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.120
This was my...

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.120
So where was the orchard here?

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.120
There.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:56.120
Oh, gosh.

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.120
Yes.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.120
Okay.

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.120
And this was my garden out by here.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:02.120
Ah.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:04.120
Did you ever have horses on your farm?

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.120
No.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.120
No.

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.120
No.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.120
No, just the two donkeys.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.120
Oh, we did...

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.120
Oh gosh, that's me when I was...

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.120
Oh, I shouldn't be showing you this.

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:13.120
This is 1951.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.120
Oh, please do.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:18.120
I presented Langhorst in Breckenshire.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.120
Really?

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:24.120
So when it was haymaking, would you have had to make all the lunches for everyone coming

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.120
in who was helping with the haymaking?

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:30.120
Yes, usually in the evening I'd cook ham, potatoes and stuff like that.

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.120
They'd come in at supper time.

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:34.120
Not so much in the daytime.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.120
I mean, they'd have someone to eat sandwiches or something.

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.120
But I used to cook dinner in the evening for them to come in.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.120
Yes, and they'd come back.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.120
Yes, we had a lovely life really.

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.120
And that was me.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:50.120
So did you ever... you were probably then too young to have ever thatched hay ricks then

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.120
and stuff?

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.120
Well, yes, I've seen them then.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.120
Have you?

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.120
Yes.

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:59.120
When I was up, my grandparents, they used to do it there.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:04.120
But of course we've always had the bands and of course the bales now, but we used to do

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:05.120
small bales.

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.120
Yes.

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:10.120
I think there's a certain amount of small bales now, if I remember rightly.

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.120
Because it's the round ones now, isn't it?

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.120
Yes, of course.

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.120
Yes, the big round ones.

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.120
Yes, all times have altered.

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:21.120
So was there any... there's something I've been meaning to ask and I've forgotten to ask

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:29.120
everybody else, but was there... excuse me... any food or meals?

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:37.120
So for example, my parents are Irish and a traditional meal we would have would be boiled

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:44.120
ham, parsley sauce and something called chump, which was potatoes and onions and cabbage.

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.120
Yes, yes.

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:48.120
Is there anything on the moors that was traditional like that?

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.120
Any particular dishes or...?

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.120
I used to always boil ham.

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.120
Yes.

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:56.120
You know, I liked boiled ham and potatoes and stuff like that.

00:39:56.120 --> 00:40:05.120
No, I suppose... I think it's a thing that's a farmhouse meal, isn't it?

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.120
Yes.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:12.120
So, ham, potatoes, peas, parsley sauce, you know, that type of thing, isn't it?

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:17.120
So you would always be in the kitchen providing food for people working on the farm?

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:19.120
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.120
Yes, yes, yes.

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:27.120
Yes, I used to go out and feed the children with chicken in there, feed the poultry and

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.120
all that.

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:35.120
But yes, they'd come in then about 10, 11 o'clock and then they'd sit down at the supper and

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:38.120
they'd go about 12 o'clock, 1 o'clock.

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.120
Wow.

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.120
Yes, yes.

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.120
I used to enjoy the hay making.

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.120
The harvest time used to be lovely.

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.120
Why was it... why did you like it?

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.120
Because it was just a...

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:49.120
Well, I think... well, me too.

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:54.120
They used to come in and have a rest and then, you know, we'd go hauling the bales and all

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:57.120
this business, you know, the loose hay years ago.

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.120
Yes.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:01.120
I thought I had a photograph here of... I haven't got one.

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:04.120
I thought I had a photograph here of the...

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.120
Oh, what was it?

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:10.120
So do you remember any of the people who used to work for the drainage board that used to

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:13.120
come round and clear the reams and stuff?

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:18.120
Oh dear, what was his name?

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.120
I can see him now.

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.120
Oh, really?

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:26.120
Oh, they're looking to meet in a moment.

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:30.120
Yes, he was just slashed over the long-handled hook.

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.120
Oh, do you remember that?

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.120
Down the Broadway.

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:33.120
Yeah.

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.120
Down the Broadway particularly.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.120
Oh.

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:44.120
Well, the one that has died now, a couple of months ago.

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.120
Oh.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:51.120
I can't think of the other gentleman.

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:54.120
I can see him now doing it, you know.

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.120
Well, that's silly, isn't it?

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.120
It'll come to you.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.120
It'll come.

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:02.120
And so Dilwyn was on the drainage board?

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:05.120
Yeah, Dilwyn was on the drainage board and his father was before him.

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.120
Yeah.

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.120
So what did that mean?

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:12.120
Did it mean just, you know, was it an important role?

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:16.120
Well, I suppose it controlled the reams and everything really, wasn't it?

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:22.120
The drainage board more or less, you know, to see that they were cut and the reeds were

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:26.120
cut and everything from off the sides.

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:33.120
And I suppose control the gates, it opened out opposite the bottom of the Broadway.

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:34.120
Yes.

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:36.120
The gates, it's all automatic now, you see.

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.120
Yeah, all changed.

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:41.120
Years ago it used to have you be done more or less by hands, you know.

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:45.120
So it's the most, very interesting really.

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:48.120
Very interesting, aren't they, in different things?

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:49.120
I think so.

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:50.120
I think it's fascinating actually.

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:51.120
Yes, yes.

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:52.120
It's very different.

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.120
What about fish?

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:57.120
Did you ever get eels in the ream?

00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:01.120
Oh yes, yes, down the bottom of the sluice, you know.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.120
You used to have eels out of there.

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.120
Did you?

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.120
Yes, yes.

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.120
What, you used to cook them?

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.120
Oh yes, I used to live in Eel.

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:09.120
Really?

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:11.120
So how did you catch them and cook them?

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:19.120
Oh, you catch them with a rod and put them on the end of it, you know, catch them like

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:20.120
that.

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:21.120
You'd put them back in there.

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.120
Yeah.

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:27.120
So as, you know, they'd have fresh water, so you'd kill them and eat them.

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.120
How long would you do it?

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.120
I wouldn't, he wouldn't.

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:30.120
Oh no.

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:33.120
But you would keep them in the fresh bucket for a few days, fresh with water?

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:39.120
Oh yes, change of water for a day or two so as they get the, well, the earthy stuff.

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.120
Otherwise you'd be eating earth.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.120
So you would do that?

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.120
Yeah.

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.120
Really?

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:45.120
Yeah.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:46.120
And then you would skin it?

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.120
Yeah.

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:50.120
And then cook it, fry it in the frying pan, chop it up bits.

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:51.120
Really?

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.120
But they were very keen.

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:53.120
I mean, I enjoy anything.

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:54.120
Yeah.

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.120
Or everything put it that way.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:56.120
Yeah.

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:59.120
I'm not, plus even my food I enjoy a lot.

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.120
That's a good free source of food though.

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:02.120
Yeah, it is, yes.

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.120
What about elders?

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:06.120
Was that something anyone ever had down there?

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.120
No.

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.120
No.

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:09.120
I don't think so.

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.120
No, no.

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:16.120
On the bottom end of the drive of the bus, you have them down there.

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:22.120
I need to get them up through the, you know, up the piers you get them in the bus.

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.120
Did you?

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.120
Pretty.

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.120
Yes, yeah.

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.120
Crikey.

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:32.120
Oh yes, it's, it's fascinating really, you know, when you think back what you've seen

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:33.120
and done.

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.120
What about church?

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:37.120
Did your family ever go to church, you know, when you were down living on?

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:40.120
Yes, I used to go to St. Peter's Church, which is the big church in the village.

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:41.120
Yeah.

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.120
But of course that closed.

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:45.120
And it's a house now, person.

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:48.120
Is that something the whole family would go to?

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:52.120
Yes, Sunday morning we used to try and go to church on a Sunday evening.

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:55.120
I mean, Father Prosser was a church warden there.

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:56.120
Was he?

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.120
His father.

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.120
Yeah.

00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:59.120
Oh yes, he was a big churchman.

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.120
Was he?

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.120
Yes, yes, and Mother used to go, Mother Prosser used to go.

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:03.120
Yeah.

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:08.120
And they were occasionally, and they were married, they were married in Peterstone Church.

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:13.120
But of course it closed then, a little while after.

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:17.120
And it's a house now, people's got it as a house.

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:24.120
They were living in there, I don't know, unfortunately the gentleman died now only last year.

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.120
His wife and the child are still there.

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:31.120
But apparently they were, I've never been in there since, naturally, but they were living

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:32.120
in pods.

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.120
Were they?

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:37.120
It's a big church, man, it's huge, high, cropped, tremendous height.

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:38.120
Yeah.

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:39.120
Yeah.

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.120
Been up the top of the tower, lovely view from there.

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:43.120
Really?

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:44.120
Yeah.

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:45.120
And then?

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.120
Well the congregation had been very big.

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:50.120
Well yes, it varied then.

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:57.120
You know, it's like Marsh, Marshfield is a bigger church, or they do get more congregation

00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.120
there, because I suppose it's in a bigger village, isn't it?

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:03.120
And that's a nice church too, St Mary's Church.

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:09.120
I've got a rose tree down there for doing, but I've also got a casket up in the field

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:10.120
up here.

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:11.120
Have you?

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.120
Of his ashes, yes.

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.120
Oh.

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.120
And...

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:19.120
Do you remember any characters that stand out for you that you remember?

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:24.120
Well, before the buildings that are over the other side of the road now, there were buildings,

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:26.120
but not like they are now.

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.120
And there used to be an old fellow living in there.

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.120
Yeah.

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:32.120
And Dennis his name was.

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:35.120
And he used to wear a long, long coat.

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:40.120
He lived in there and there was a grate in the corner, where you'd have a bit of a fireplace

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.120
if you wanted it.

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:46.120
And Dennis, and he'd walk from there then into town, or Romney, and walk back.

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:49.120
I can see him now, it was in the stages ago.

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.120
Yeah.

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.120
But he had this long, long black coat.

00:46:52.120 --> 00:47:01.120
There was another one down at the farm down at St. Brides, and his name was...

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:04.120
He was another character.

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:09.120
I'm trying to think of his name.

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.120
He lived in a barn.

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:17.120
I don't like to use the word tramp, but kind of like just somebody who used to...

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:21.120
Yes, they were kind of a tramp type of person, you know.

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:23.120
Billy Mitch, that was down there.

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:28.120
That's right, and Dennis used to be in this one, in our barn over there.

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:36.120
No trouble, I mean, you know, actually I think Father Prosser went over there one day,

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:38.120
and he died in the Llasnym, so...

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:39.120
Really?

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.120
To get the police and all up his back.

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.120
Yeah.

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:46.120
But, no, there were characters about then, weren't there?

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:47.120
Yeah.

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:51.120
Years ago, like that.

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:54.120
I can see them, I can place them now.

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.120
It's gone back a little while.

00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:59.120
Yes, Dennis and Billy Mitch used to call him.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:04.120
And they reckoned that if the airplanes were coming over during the war,

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:07.120
because that was when he was there during the war,

00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:11.120
he'd turn his pipe upside down, in cases.

00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:14.120
Oh, isn't that lovely?

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:18.120
It's a compliment when you think it was a thing, because they might see his pipe.

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:20.120
Oh, right.

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:23.120
Oh, Jesus, really funny.

00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:28.120
Someone was telling me, now, where was it now?

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.120
I can't remember.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.120
Oh, something about that...

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:36.120
Was it St. Brides, or was it somewhere else there?

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:41.120
I might be wrong, but on the Sunday, the pubs used to be closed in Wales.

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.120
This is when the border was different,

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:47.120
so people used to flood over to here to use the pubs on the Sunday.

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:48.120
Is that right?

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.120
Maybe I've got that wrong.

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:54.120
No, they used to...

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:57.120
There was a law, wasn't there, where the pubs used to close on a Sunday,

00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:59.120
a lot of places.

00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:03.120
But I can't remember where that was.

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:05.120
I might have got that wrong, actually.

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:09.120
I feel very sad, really, the six bars was closed.

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:11.120
Yeah.

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:15.120
There were two cottages at the side of that.

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:19.120
Was it a popular pub?

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:21.120
Oh, yes.

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:25.120
We've had a lot of lovely times down there, especially Christmas time.

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:28.120
We'd go down there, and somebody would be playing the organ,

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.120
and we'd have a good old sing-song and that.

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.120
Yeah.

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.120
Oh, I think I've got a photograph.

00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:37.120
I'm boring you with these photographs.

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:39.120
You are not. I love photographs, Margaret.

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:41.120
I really do love photographs.

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:49.120
This is the six bars with all the horses.

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.120
No, that's interesting.

00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:53.120
I think I might have seen that photograph before.

00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:55.120
Have you, maybe?

00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:58.120
Erm, no, I think...

00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:00.120
He was no master.

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:04.120
So what hunt, which pack is this?

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:06.120
This would be the...

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.120
What's it?

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:10.120
Trudiga.

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:12.120
Trudiga?

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:14.120
Trudiga hunt, yes.

00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.120
And this is the one you used to follow in your sports car?

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.120
Yes, that's right, yes.

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.120
Oh, and who's this?

00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:22.120
Do you know where this is taken?

00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.120
No, I'm not certain of that.

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:26.120
That's...

00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:28.120
And you see there's two cottages at the side of the six bars.

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.120
Oh, yes, yes.

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.120
And this is...

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:34.120
What was this? Cairnfip?

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.120
Oh, I don't know, last year?

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:38.120
Because it looks like it's been closed for years, doesn't it?

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.120
Yes, it does, yes.

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:42.120
It looks a bit messed up.

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:44.120
Yes, it's a shame because we've had a lot of fun down there.

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:46.120
Yeah.

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.120
I was thinking about St Melan's show.

00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:50.120
Yes, that's folded now.

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.120
That's folded.

00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:54.120
But I understand that was a huge event in its time.

00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:56.120
Yes, yes, it was very good.

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.120
We had tremendous times with the show.

00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:00.120
We used to be on the...

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:02.120
First of all,

00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:04.120
St Melan's show was to be at Remney,

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:06.120
on the top of

00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:08.120
Remney Hill.

00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:10.120
And then it came then to...

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:12.120
Oh, what's there now?

00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:14.120
Oh.

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.120
The only one, Cud Curnow.

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:18.120
Bakers used to

00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:20.120
have the farm.

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:22.120
Oh.

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:24.120
Well, all these...

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:26.120
Oh dear, I can't look at the name.

00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:30.120
Oh, that's silly, isn't it?

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.120
You know, when you go down now towards Newport,

00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:34.120
all these buildings on the right-hand side

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:36.120
and this left-hand side.

00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:38.120
Like a radiator plant and stuffer.

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:40.120
That's right, yes. We used to have the show there.

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.120
Did you?

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:44.120
And then we came then to Kevin Mappley here, down the bottom of this lane,

00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:46.120
where you came over the bridge by the farm park.

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:48.120
We used to have it there.

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:50.120
Oh, really? Yes, in the big field there.

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:52.120
And...

00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:54.120
Oh, yes, and then we went then

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:56.120
to Jadika House.

00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.120
But it was never the same.

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.120
Not really. You know, it was to get...

00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:02.120
I don't know why it was, because it was a nice site.

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:04.120
But...

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:06.120
We didn't get the agricultural side of things.

00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:08.120
Yeah, it changed.

00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:10.120
It changed altogether.

00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:12.120
So where it was used to be by Coy Curnow...

00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:14.120
Yes. What was it...

00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:16.120
So where that area is now, it's completely developed, isn't it?

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:18.120
Oh, yes.

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:20.120
Was it just farmland then? It was farmland.

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:22.120
It's hard to imagine.

00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:24.120
It is, isn't it?

00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:26.120
So before the motorway and everything, it was...

00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:28.120
Yes, well, of course they were talking,

00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.120
they were putting another road up

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:32.120
onto the motorway.

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:34.120
I don't know why that's going to happen, I don't know.

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:36.120
But it was just farmland?

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:38.120
Yes, yes, because it was just a little bit there.

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.120
And it was where all the local farmers

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:42.120
would go along there, would they,

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:44.120
to present, show their

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.120
livestock? Yes, oh, yes.

00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:48.120
And be a proper agriculture show? Oh, yes, it was.

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.120
Definitely, everything was there.

00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:52.120
And the local show now

00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:54.120
is Macken's Show.

00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:56.120
And that's always on the first Saturday

00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:58.120
of July. And that's a nice little show.

00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:00.120
And that's as big as what St. Melans was.

00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:02.120
But...

00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:04.120
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:06.120
We've had a lot of fun at the shows.

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:08.120
Yeah, lovely.

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:10.120
But things have altered, haven't they, over the years?

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.120
Yeah, they do.

00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:14.120
I was going to ask you about the lighthouse pub.

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:16.120
Is that something that

00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:18.120
locals would have ever used?

00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:20.120
Was that something people from out of town would use?

00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.120
Have you been down to the lighthouse pub?

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:24.120
Yeah. Oh, it was very pleasant.

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.120
And a lot of people used to walk

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:28.120
on the bank, you know, across the bank.

00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:30.120
Really? Mm-hmm.

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:32.120
Would people walk along from the Cardiff

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:34.120
along here? Yes, well, yes.

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:36.120
From Remney, perhaps, you know, walk.

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:38.120
And then you would see them go back and that, you know.

00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:40.120
Oh, yes, yeah.

00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:42.120
It was very pleasant on there. It was a nice day.

00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.120
Yeah, it is. It's nice. You know, it's...

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.120
You go up and you can see both sides.

00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:48.120
Yeah. I'm sure it was

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.120
telling me that...

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:52.120
that people used to

00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:54.120
stay in almost

00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:56.120
like a chalet, seat shack

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.120
in...

00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:00.120
by the sea wall.

00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:02.120
At St. Brides. At St. Brides?

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.120
Yes. Or was it...? They've got caravans

00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:06.120
there now. I don't think he meant

00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:08.120
the caravan that people would rent out

00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:10.120
and would come out for the weekend

00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:12.120
and... Maybe he did mean the caravan, actually.

00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:14.120
I didn't think he did mean that.

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:16.120
Maybe I got that wrong.

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:18.120
But you said people would come out for the day

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.120
on their bikes and...

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:22.120
Oh, a lot of people used to recite

00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:24.120
Lotus in Brides. Really? Yes, yes.

00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:26.120
Yeah. Yes.

00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:28.120
And because they'd had these little tent things,

00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:30.120
wouldn't they? Oh, really?

00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:32.120
Yes, yes. You'd see those, don't they?

00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:34.120
What, like people would camp?

00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:36.120
Yes, yes. They'd sleep in there and then...

00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.120
Really? But along by the wall?

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:40.120
Not so much at all,

00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:42.120
but before they put the

00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:44.120
caravan sites, because there are

00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:46.120
a fair bit of caravan sites at St. Brides

00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:48.120
apparently, which I haven't been there for years.

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:50.120
Excuse me. And...

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:52.120
They used to have these

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:54.120
little tent things, you know, you see

00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:56.120
it on the television, don't they?

00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:58.120
Really? Yes.

00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:00.120
Oh, I didn't know that. Yes, it's...

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.120
Yes, times have changed, haven't they?

00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:04.120
Yeah, they have.

00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:06.120
I said, it's one thing I have to ask you about,

00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.120
because I was asking about it, because part of what

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:10.120
I'm doing is

00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:12.120
talking to people who live

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.120
along the moors, but that

00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:16.120
includes people from the Gypsy community.

00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:18.120
Do you remember

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:20.120
any Gypsies coming through?

00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:22.120
Well,

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:24.120
when we had ground,

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.120
we'd entered ground on the corner down

00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:28.120
in St. Brides, and...

00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:32.120
...

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.120
where the Gypsy Caravan Site is now.

00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.120
There used to be the old...

00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:40.120
She was an old Gypsy in the proper old...

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.120
....

00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:44.120
Yeah, and they were there for years

00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:46.120
on the corner of our field,

00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:48.120
and we used to have to just pass them,

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:50.120
you know, to go into the field, and they'd give

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:52.120
no trouble to us, but these are not Gypsies,

00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:54.120
are they? Not been unkind,

00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:56.120
they'd travel us.

00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:58.120
And, I mean...

00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:00.120
I mean, they've got horses tethered,

00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:05.160
And, well, a friend of mine, she saw this little tiny pony one day and she thought the

00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:07.160
pole was in her way.

00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:08.160
It's sweet.

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:10.880
She came home and took some hay down to give it on the road.

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:11.880
You know, it's sad.

00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:13.880
No, these are travellers, more, I think.

00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:19.200
You know, they're not the proper gypsy, I don't think.

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:20.200
There we are.

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:21.200
That's life, I suppose, isn't it?

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:22.200
It is, I suppose.

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:24.840
And there's so many of them now, isn't there?

00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:29.080
So do you know, you go towards Cardiff and Rumley from where it lives now.

00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.080
Yes.

00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:34.600
And, I mean, when you first arrived, was that just agricultural land?

00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.080
Oh yes, all just fields.

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:39.080
It's hard for me to imagine.

00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:40.080
Yes, yes, yes.

00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:47.080
And, of course, there's the KLG, which is a bit firm opposite, isn't there?

00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:48.080
Yeah.

00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:49.080
Doing motor things.

00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:53.480
But, oh yes, it was all, it's most unfortunate.

00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:59.600
I mean, there's a little house there as you go down towards the caravan site, on the right-hand

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:02.520
side, he was the coalman, Mrs Sadler.

00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:09.120
And I look at it now and I think to myself, oh, if he came back and saw us, yeah, he'd

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:11.320
be very, very upset about it, you know.

00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:12.320
Yeah.

00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:13.320
He was the coalman.

00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:14.320
Yes.

00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:15.320
So he delivered the coal?

00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:18.320
He delivered the coal, yes, he had the bags of coal.

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:19.320
Yes.

00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:24.000
Mrs Sadler, his son is still alive and he lives in Rumley.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.600
I've seen him for some time, actually.

00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:29.600
But as the house was, it was immaculate, you know.

00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:34.600
But as it is now, the slates are gone and it's a mess.

00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:36.600
It breaks his heart.

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:41.600
Do you remember a nurse, I'm sure it was Nurse Cox, she was the midwife?

00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:43.600
Oh yes, yes, yes.

00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:46.600
Now, she lived on the top of Pendle Land, didn't she?

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:47.600
That's right.

00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:53.600
Well, there were two cottages there and I'm very friendly with Betty Stevens, her name

00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:55.600
is now, she was Betty Bridge.

00:57:55.600 --> 00:58:02.600
She lived in there, one of those and her brother and those were of course away gone.

00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.600
Yes, Nurse Cox.

00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:08.600
And there was another nurse, she lived up there too, because Nurse Cox moved down to

00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:09.600
Castleton.

00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:10.600
Yes.

00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:14.600
On the left-hand side, as you go down off the main road.

00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:17.600
Oh yes, she used to go round delivering the babies.

00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:20.600
Yeah, did she deliver Andrew and your daughter?

00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:22.600
No, I went into Glossop.

00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:23.600
Oh, did you?

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:25.600
Yes, yes, I went to Glossop test.

00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:26.600
Yeah.

00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:29.600
I just said it with both of them actually.

00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:34.600
But, yes, you bring back memories for me as well.

00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:36.600
Oh, well I met her...

00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:41.600
Well, I suppose we got hedge rows here, where as down there there's the greens.

00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:42.600
Ah, yeah.

00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:45.600
You know, but not really I suppose, no.

00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:47.600
No, the grass is green.

00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:48.600
Yeah, yeah.

00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:51.600
And you drove a tractor from early on?

00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:53.600
Oh yes, yes, yes.

00:58:53.600 --> 00:59:01.600
I drove, when we moved from Langorse down to Berry Hill, and Ferguson, Ferguson, 25,

00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:07.600
excuse me, I did three journeys from Langorse down to Berry Hill, and took me four and a

00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:08.600
half hours.

00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:09.600
Really?

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:13.600
With the trailer behind with implements and stuff, brought them down to Berry Hill Farm.

00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:19.600
And, and then when I was going back, do you know the way, do you know Pontypool area at

00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:20.600
which, you know...

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:22.600
I've been to Pontymoil recently.

00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:23.600
Pontymoil?

00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:24.600
Yeah.

00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:25.600
Oh, right, yeah.

00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:28.600
Well, when you go, it wasn't the new road then, because we wouldn't have been able to

00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:29.600
go on the new road anyway.

00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:30.600
Yeah.

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:35.600
Now, we wouldn't be able to go on the motorway, you know, with the tractor, the same then.

00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:40.600
And I used to go down past the horse and jockey on the bottom, and I used to go down the

00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:44.600
hill and knock it out of gear, and go down that hill like the crappers.

00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:47.600
And I often think, well what if something came across the road?

00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:48.600
I wouldn't have the truck.

00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:49.600
Oh my goodness.

00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:51.600
You do things when you're young, don't you?

00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:52.600
Yeah.

00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:55.600
Yeah, I did three journeys that.

00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:59.600
I brought the plough up and I brought a big trailer up with implements on.

00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.600
And, yes, it took me four and a half hours.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.600
And were you the only child?

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.600
Yes.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:07.600
I haven't even got a cousin.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:08.600
Really?

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.600
No, but my two aunts didn't marry.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:13.600
My one aunt did marry, but we didn't have any family.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:15.600
And then my uncle, he married.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:16.600
He did.
