You're listening to Rhiannon talking about her family's reaction to her boyfriend.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.840
When I went and worked in a workshop, I saw this guy and I really, really, really liked him.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.560
And we talked and we got to know each other.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.200
And it just went off from there and told my parents.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.920
And they said, oh, we want to meet this person.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.600
Came over for a barbecue and they just didn't like him.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.760
And we did something really stupid.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.240
Well, I didn't think it was really stupid, but my parents didn't like what we did.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.400
And that's why it had to end.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.440
I didn't want it to end, but my parents ended it.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.720
And when we sold the house, we were living with friends.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.760
And then we just, I could see him and I opened the door and I wanted to go run up to him

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.320
and see him and say hello.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.680
My parents saw him and just, because I was sitting in the car at the time.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:24.640
And my parents just shoved me inside the house because they didn't want me to see him.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.560
And how old were you at this time?

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.560
I was 19, 20.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.600
And I'm still not happy with the way things ended.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:47.520
And I wish I could just reconnect because I really like this guy.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.600
Although I'm moving forward with my life and hopefully meeting new people

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.840
and going on these dating sites that something will materialise.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.640
Do your parents know that you're on the dating sites?

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.140
No.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:18.960
I would really like to tell them all about it, but I know they will 100% disagree.
