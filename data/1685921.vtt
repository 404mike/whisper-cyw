00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Felly, ddiddordeu i chi, Fyndiwr.

Rydw i'n mynd yn Carowent. Rydw i'n mynd yma ar y 30 oedd.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Rydw i'n gweithredwr locomotif o…

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
O, yw'r hyn yn ddiddordeu. Rydw i'n gweithredwr ym Mhobl Tyne o 1958.

Yn hynny, fe ddiddordeu i'r gweithredwr diesel.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Dydw i ddim yn ddiddordeu'r traenau'r dyfodol oherwydd bod ym Mhobl Tyne oedd anoddol iawn.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Roedd angen i chi gael gwaith ar y bwtau o ddod oedden nhw, yn eich bod.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Ond roeddwn i'n dweud, fe ddiddordeu yn 1980.

Yn hynny, fe ddiddordeu i'r 7th anon yn 1987 pan oedd yn llesio.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000

Yn hynny, fe ddiddordeu fy gyrfa yn Newport fel gweithredwr.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
A dyna oedd yn 2005, dydw i'n meddwl.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Felly, roedd y traenau, y gweithredwr locomotif, roedd yn cael ei ddiddordeu yn ymwneud â'r bwtau oedd?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Ie, yn unrhyw amser, roedd.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Mae rhai o'r gweithredwr yn cael ei ddiddordeu yn y ffordd o'r ddod oedd eich gyd.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Mae'n ei ddiddordeu, maent yn ymwneud â fy nghymru.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Yn hynny?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Ie.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Felly…

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Roedd…

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Ond roedd…

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Roedd yn cael ei ddiddordeu, yw, fel y byddwn yn ffamilio gyda phobl gwahanol a phethau a'r hynny.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Roedd yn cael eithaf a ddiddordeu mwy oherwydd roedd gennym ni yn y gwaith yng Nghymru a'r ffyrdd.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Ond yn unrhyw amser, roedd y gweithredwr yn y ffordd oedd y superioedd.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Roedd yn cael ei ddiddordeu ar y ffordd oedd Caligot, a fyddai'n ffos.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Mae'n ffos iawn ar y ffordd oedd y ffordd oedd y ffordd oedd y ffyrdd.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Ie.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Ond yw'r gweithredwr yma?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Mae'r gweithredwr yma, ie.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Beth am y ffyrdd yna?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
O, roedd yn gweithredo ar y ffordd.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Mae hynny'n ddiddordeu.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Roeddwn yn gwybod yna ymlaen.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
O, oes. Roedd yn gwybod yn unrhyw amser.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Roedd unrhyw amser yn mannaf, roedd yn ddechrau'r gweithredwr.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Roedd yn y blaen i ni, unrhyw amser, roedd yn y blaen i ni.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Roedd bod yn ddechrau'r gweithredwr.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Ond rwyf wedi bod yn ddechrau.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Ond rwyf wedi bod yn ddechrau.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Roedd llawer o'r gweithredwr yn y ddechrau.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Oherwydd roedd...

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
O, beth o gwirioedd o gweithredwr oedd yna?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Roedd...

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Roedd...

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Coffrwch i'r cydnabwyd, y cydnabwyd yma ar ôl o ddwy o blynyddoedd.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
dyna'r ffyrdd a'r ffyrdd.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
A yna roedd y llwybr yn ymwneud, oedd oedd o'n bwysig bod...

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Felly, y byddai'n dechrau, byddai'n dweud,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
yw'r llwybr yma, mae'n ddwy o 300 staff ymlaen.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Roeddwn yn edrych ar y llwybr yma,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
ac roedd 17 staff yn y stafion ym Mherthyr.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
17?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
17, 17.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Why?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Mae'n ddiddorol, ie.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Ynodd?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000

Roeddwn yn gwybod yn Caerphilly.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
O.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Roedd fy fater yn gweithredd yn RnPF Dynham,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
A roedd yn trafodol bob ddiddorol yn y Ddwy.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Ond yna, oherwydd y Ddwy,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Felly, i...

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Trwy Caldicot.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Caldicot?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Ie.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Felly, byddwch chi'n dweud,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Caerphilly yw'r tôn rhowyd?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Nid, 7 Tunnel yn y tôn rhowyd.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Rogget yn y tôn rhowyd, amser.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Mae'n unrhyw fater yn Rogget yn unrhyw fater,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
A dyna'n...

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Roedd yn unrhyw fater, dwi'n credu,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
yn Rogget, sydd gweithredd gan Rhowyd Bryd.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
A roedd yn cael ei ddynnu?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Y cyngor a'r angen.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Yn hyn, mae'r cyngor yn ymlaen.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Roedd yn cael eu cwlleriad eu hun.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Mae'r cyngor Ocean and Taft, Merthyr,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
a'r cyngor yn cael eu cwlleriad eu hun,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
cyngorau ysbyg.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Felly, beth sydd angen am ei?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000

O, gallai eisiau cael ffotograffiau, yna?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Gallai eisiau cael ffotograffiau,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
O, ffyswch.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Roedd yn dda i'n gwybod,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
a gallwn ni gydolio, roedd yn man ymlaen.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Felly, sut ydych chi'n cael eu gynnig?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Roedd yn progresiwn natural.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Roedd yn progresiwn.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Mae'n rhaid i'n mynd ar y ddwylo, yn wirturiol.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Ond pam yw hynny? Felly, mae'n rhaid i chi ddod o'r ddwylo?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Mae'n rhaid i chi ddod o'r ddwylo?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Roeddwn i'n ddwylo yna.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Roeddwn i'n cael ei gynnig yn y 50au, yn y 50au cymorth.

A wedyn roeddwn i'n mynd i'r Ysgol Rogu yn 58.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Felly roedd yn gynnyddio fel gynnyddwyr?

Ie.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Rwy'n meddwl am hynny?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Beth yw hynny yn ymwneud?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000

roeddwn yn dweud, roeddwn yn gynnig

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
William Davies.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Mae'n byw yn 25 ymddiriedd Iffton Terris.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Yna roeddwn yn gynnig y bai yma

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
a'i llwybr a'i ddod yn ymddygiad.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
A'i dweud,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
yn dda,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
roeddwn yn dod yn ôl.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
A'i dweud,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
o'r hyn o'ch ddweud,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
roeddwn yn dweud, roeddwn yn mynd i unrhyw un,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
yn ystod ymlaen, a'r hyn a'r hyn a'r hyn.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
A'r traenwrydau sy'n byw ar y 7 ymddiriedad?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Ie.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Mae'r mwyaf o'n byw ar ymddiriedd roeddwn yn ymddygiad.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Ie.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Ond oedd yn cael ogystal â phwynt

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
a'i ddod yn ymddygiad?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
O, ie. Roeddwn yn ddod yn ymddygiad yno

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
am ddod yn ymddygiad.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Mae'r hyn a'i ddod yn ymddygiad

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
yn cael ei ddod yn ymddygiad,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
oherwydd roedd yn ffyrdd cymdeithasol,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
yn iawn. Roedd yn dda

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
pan oedd genedlaeth ymddygiad,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
ond roedd y genedlaeth

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
y byddaf i'n ymddygiadu

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
yn, well,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
roedd yn fwy llach, a'i ddod yn

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
ymddygiadau. Mae'n gwybod,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
a dwi'n gallu ddysgu,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
ond pan oedd discipline

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
yn y ffordd real,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
pan oedd y Gweithdor Cymru yna.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Dwi ddim yn gallu ddod yn ymddygiad,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Gweithdor Cymru, 54?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Dwi ddim yn gwybod.

Mae'n cabio ein bod daill yn ymgwy اchel,

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:48.540
Why did he live there? Well he was a single fellow. He had no family we heard of but there was a lot of people lived in the hostel then mind you.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:54.540
Drivers and firemen and guards. Well this was because they were just pre-married?

00:12:54.540 --> 00:13:07.540
Well a lot of them were, it was sort of an interim depot, Severntunnel. We'd have a lot of people and we'd get promotion to Severntunnel from, in them days you had an actual,

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:18.540
well if you had to vacancy come up, you had to go where the vacancy come up. If you was a senior man, if you joined on the 1st of October in say 58,

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:27.540
if there was no man senior to you at Reading, you'd have to go to Reading. Oh really? Yeah, but I was lucky because I avoided it all. Yeah.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:39.540
But yeah, you'd live in the hostel. I see. They'd hostel you in Reading, and I'd live in a hostel at Reading, whoever was doing the job would live in a hostel at Reading.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:52.540
So they were actually? So the men were promoted to Severntunnel, there was Aberdame men there, there was Whitland men there, there was Nayland, Pony Pryth, Dye Jones was a Pony Pryth man. Oh they were from all over.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:14:08.540
And the hostel would be a place to sleep? Yes, a place to sleep and meals. There was a canteen in there. OK. Yeah, there was quite a few staff in the canteen, Mrs King, Mrs Hunt. They were the cooks? Yeah, they were the cooks and caterers.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:37.540
So were they local ladies? Yes, Rocket ladies, Mrs Hunt, her husband was a driver, Doug Hunt. Oh gosh. And her son started the same time as me, Edward Hunt. So he went to school together? No, he went to school together, yeah. Edward Hunt was sat next to me at school. Really? Yeah. Oh, so he might have some photographs maybe. He might, well yeah. I tell you, I haven't seen Edward for years. Oh really? He went as a bit of a recluse.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:15:06.540
He didn't marry. He lived with his mother. Well his father died on the footplate, but he lived with his mother and then when his mother died he lived in the house and that's where he's gone. I haven't seen nothing of him. So when you say his father died on the footplate, what happened? Yeah, well he died at an heart attack and died at work. Oh dear. Yeah, oh what the hell's that? Mike Laws was his wife, was his, fireman was his wife.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:18.540
I don't know when he died. Mike Laws? Yeah, what the nurse said. We'll have to stop talking. Where's the telephone then?

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:47.540
So, so would most railway depots have a hostel? Was it run by the railway company? Yes, yes. Yes. Yeah. He was funded by the Great, well the British Rail as he was then. So would there have been a bar in there? No. No. There was a bar, the staff association was attached to it. Yeah. That's the separate building that was, that was the British Railway staff association.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:16:04.540
Yeah. Where you could go for a drink. Yeah, but after work. After work or while you were at work with somebody. I love it because it's so much part of its time, isn't it now? It was, you know, those days were gone.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:33.540
There was a pub at Bridgewater called the Britannia and that man would put two pints on the wall at the end of the platform and when you stopped at the platform you'd have a pint each and put the empties back and put the money underneath the glasses. Really? Yeah. Oh my goodness. You wouldn't dream of that now. Instant dismissal, wouldn't it? Yeah, because it's zero tolerance now, yeah.

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:57.540
So then you were an engine cleaner. Yes. And then you progressed to a fireman. Fireman. Yeah. Tell me what a fireman is. Well a fireman was a fellow who put the coal on the actual fire and kept the boiler topped up so on and so forth and observed signals when the driver was, you know, occupied with other things.

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:12.540
So you were that man shoveling the coal into the, it looks like a furnace. Yes, the firebox, yeah. Yeah. And that's called the firebox. Yeah. So, I mean, it must have been, what was it like being a fireman?

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:33.540
Well, it was hard work. Yeah. You'd empty, sometimes you'd move four or five tonne of coal in the shaft. Wow. Yeah. Especially if you was going up to London or something like that up line or sometimes you had little engines, you had smaller engines with smaller, we used to call them bunkers.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:49.540
The bunker was the place they put the coal in. Well then once you'd, if you went, you used to go to Stormsdown, you'd empty the bunker at Stormsdown going from Severntunnel to Stormsdown which was above Pontypridd. Yeah.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:18:11.540
And then we used to go all the way up there, all over the valleys. A lot of the rail places are shut now over the Cymru Viaduct, that's dismantled. Yeah. Yeah, and all. When you look at some of these railways on you, then see the photographs of the houses and that, you just can't imagine that you used to work through there.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:32.540
That's why I'm so interested to speak to you. Yeah. Yeah, we used to work to Ebbw Vale. Did you? Yeah, we used to work regularly to Oakdale Collery, Llanellath, Cymn, what's the name? Cymn, Cymn, oh I can't think of it, Cilenin, Cilenin South, Cilenin North, all in colleries up the Western Valley and Eastern Valley.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:46.540
So you would collect. We used to go right up the branches fork on the top of Aberdranys. Yeah. All on the. To collecting coal? Coal, coal, yeah, all coal. So that would have been rich Welsh mining industry then? Exactly, yeah. Yeah.

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:47.540
Everywhere, every, well every say two mile was a collerie virtually up the Valley. And the trains went up there bringing the coal down. Correct. But this wasn't just exclusively for the train, you were transporting the coal as well? Yeah, we'd bring it all to Severntunnel. Oh. And then it would get marshalled at Severntunnel. Yeah. And that's what they used to do on the marshalling yards, they'd have a hump, they'd push a train up to the

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:44.540
top of the hump and then they'd let the wagons run. You'd have a pointsman on the top. He'd say, you'd have a marker, he'd pay 28. If it was road number 28, he'd write it on the buffer. So the pointsman upstairs would look at the buffer and say that wagon's got to go in 28. So he'd set the road up for 28. Next wagon is number 7. Set the road up for 7. And they'd all go down different roads.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:20:13.540
Because I heard it was huge the marshalling yards. It was, yeah. It was 28 roads on each side of the. Wow. Yeah. Because it's all gone now. All gone. All gone. That countryside park is the one side, that's the downside that one. Yeah. So it must have been. There was an upside which was all the London traffic etc. so on and so forth. Yeah. And well not necessarily Birmingham, Swindon, all the different valleys down there.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:42.540
Different place, Temple Mills, Acton, Anwell Bridge, all depots. Morton Cutting used to be another big depot and Morton Cutting which was just the other side of Didcut. Well then they'd send them some of the trains that go rough to Morton Cutting like just London. And then when you got to Morton Cutting they'd sort it out for Taplow, different, all different stations then and then they'd get detached.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:21:11.540
So. Because we had a train that we used to call the, it was the Gloucester Pickup. Yeah. Well then we used to start out a serving tunnel. Yeah. We used to work the Sedbrooke. Yeah. With lime for the tunnel. Yeah. Lime. They used to add water to the lime. Lime to the water to thin it out. It was, I don't know what they used to do with it but it was always lime. Then we'd go to pick up a port skewet. Yeah. There was a side of the port skewet, blands, timber side. Yeah.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:42.540
And then we'd go to Chepstow and shunt to Chepstow. Yeah. But coal in the coal yard and ballast and everything all over the shop. Sometimes you had, when it was race days you used to have race course specials. What do you mean? There was a station here that you could unload the horses. Really? Yeah, all these race horses used to get unloaded at Chepstow. Never heard that before. And they'd walk them then to the race course. Because they didn't have cattle wagons and horse boxes in them days.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:58.540
That's amazing. Yeah. There was a special Chepstow, Chepstow race course platform they used to call it. And that's long gone. Oh yes. Yes, that's long, long gone. But was that in your time? It was there. I'd ever seen it used. Yeah. But it was there. The platform was there in 5860.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:28.540
I heard there was a small livestock market at Roggett. Yes, it was. Yeah. Well, there was a big livestock market at Roggett. A big one. Yeah, right opposite the school. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We used to go over there every Monday. It used to be on a Monday. What, used to go and have a look? Oh yeah, a bit school or something like that. I just have a poke around. Oh, because you were at school there? Yeah, it was at school. They had opposite look. Oh my God. And then on the Mondays we'd always slide over there for a couple of hours, bit school. Did you? Yeah.

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:58.540
Watch all the buying and selling. Yeah. Yeah. So they had, but cattle used to arrive. Oh yeah, they had the cattle specials in Severnton. There was Irish cattle here. Yeah. And then they used to unload them. There's a photo of the cattle bins in that book. Yeah. And then we'd take them down to Moors then to graze them and water them. Where's Moors? Over the Blackbridge. Oh, you wouldn't understand it. Right by the side of the, can I have, can you hand me that book for a second?

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:16.540
Thank you. There's a photograph in here of somewhere with a cattle side in. It must have been such a busy place. Oh yeah, it was unbelievably busy.

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:17.540
It was a car special as well. We used to work them. What's that? Car special before the bridge was opened to Pilnion. Car special? Yeah. They used to load cars up at Severnton. Oh yeah. That was before the bridge was opened. Do you remember that? Yeah, I worked on them, train. You really? Yeah. Yeah, that used to be what they call a banker. What's that mean? Well in 51s it used to assist every train that went through.

00:23:46.540 --> 00:24:03.540
The Severnton used to be assisted. What, somebody at the back pushing? No, at the front. Yeah. And then we'd pull them through to Pilnion and then you'd cut off at Pilnion and then you'd push them up to Patchway. Is that because you're going up into Bristol?

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:20.540
No, the trains then, we used to be loose coupled. We never used to couple up to the back of the train. Well then when the train got to the level it could just go. And we'd drop back from the train and then we'd go back to Pilnion to assist the next train.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:36.540
What, going, you'd reverse out to the tunnel? Yeah, no, we'd go back across, change over the points and come right road back to Pilnion and then we'd wait at Pilnion for another train to come. And then we'd assist that train through the Severnton tunnel in the other direction.

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:45.540
So you've been through that tunnel? Oh, thousands and thousands of times. Really? Yeah. Have you ever stopped in the tunnel? Yes, yeah, a few times. What for?

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:54.540
Well, we've had a few things in there. Actually, we don't bother with iPhones, we had a body in there once, but that's by the way. Oh gosh, yeah, yeah.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:25:14.540
And yeah, you had a different thing. We actually used to have engineering trains in there on Sundays. Yeah. And we used to walk in from whichever end the engineering was. You'd walk up to your train and then relieve the drivers so it was all ready there and they'd walk back out.

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:31.540
Gosh, is it, what's it like? Black, black, you've never seen anything black has it? If you didn't, you'd lose yourself, if you turned around you'd be lost. So the cars that used to come on, did they just drive on? Drive on, yeah.

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:46.540
And where did the people stay in the car? In the carriage, there was a carriage. And the carriage. And a, there's a catlip in. Was that quite popular? Yes, it used to run three or four times a day. Such a good photograph.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:26:01.540
Yeah, well when I was on about the moors, there's a bridge here, a black bridge just by here, someone used to drive them over there. Is that the one near where the wildlife place is today? Yes. Yeah, I know that bridge. That was called the black bridge.

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:30.540
That was the black, it was black until they sat in his electrification. You'll probably see a photograph of it. All these photographs are taken off the black bridge. So the cattle were driven over the black bridge? Yeah, that was out to the moors then. That was the fields that were out there. And then they'd graze for X amount of hours and then we'd bring them back and load them back up. And then they'd go to destination marketing. Oh crikey, that's amazing.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:27:00.540
It is, yeah, and that was the cattle pens there. Yeah. Where's the hostel? There. Ah, so it's quite big. That was the front and this was the sleeping area I think. So they didn't have far to stumble to work there? Oh no, no. Well actually our shed was, that was the shelters and guards place that was. Yeah. The locomotive shed was down the other side of the station. I think Terry took me down there.

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:31.540
Well, I don't know. I can't see it on there. Do you remember any of the drivers you used to work with? Yeah, yes. Well you had regular mates in them days. Yeah. Well you mean mates, was that just a working term? No, mate was your driver and you used to have the same driver all the time. Did you? Yeah, unless your driver was ill or he had a day off or something. But you'd have the same driver all the time. So who did you have? Well, I had a few drivers. Johnny,

00:27:31.540 --> 00:28:00.540
Johnny Lewis was about the best driver I had. I had a bloke called Bert Locker. He lived round the Avenue where he was a good gardener. He was a water man. He couldn't pass a water column, Bert. What do you mean by that? Were there water columns? Yes, all over the town. There was a water column at East Dusk in Newport. There'd be another column, water column the other side of Newport then.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:18.540
There was a water column at Baisleg and if you were going up the valleys, another water column. Because there used to be a junction there. You were up to Baisleg to Bedworth and Tritomers and Caerphilly and across that way. And then there was another one up the Western Valley. Eastern Valley, that's what Eastern Valley, the Western Valley was.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:28.540
Yeah. So because you needed how much water? Well, not as much as Bert used to want. He used to have to tread it in with Bert.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:40.540
Really? So, I mean, was it a question of attaching a pipe? It was a question of making a shelling, to tell you the truth. Oh really? What do you mean? Well, you'd work overtime then, wouldn't you?

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:56.540
Oh! Oh my goodness! Yeah, an elderly driver used to make a shelling, that's what we used to call it. Well, if you went over your time, you'd have time in a quarter, wouldn't you? You'd work your eight hours.

00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:07.540
Yeah. And then if you worked eight and a half, you'd get half an hour of time and a half, which would be three quarters of an hour's pay. And not bad at the end of the month? At the end of the week when it all added up.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:15.540
Oh yeah, so was it weekly wages then? Weekly wages in those days, yeah. What, cash in an envelope with your wages then? Cash in a little tin. In a little tin? Yeah.

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:32.540
Whoever used to put, we were talking about that the other day, weren't we love? Whoever used to put all that money, because your money would be £9.80. Well, £184 shillings, my money was when we got married. Yeah. A week. That was £9. Oh my God!

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:55.540
£184 shillings is £9.04, isn't it? Don't ask me. Yeah, well that was my rate of £184 shillings when I was made a fireman. So you said it was in a tin? Yeah, a little tin. Yeah. And you'd check it and then you'd hand your tin back. Really? You'd have your number on your tin, 261 was my number. Yeah.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:16.540
And you'd go up to the thing, you'd have it, you'd get issued on Friday morning, you'd get issued with your token. Yeah. Which was 261. Yeah. And then when you got your pay, you'd have to surrender your token and then he'd give you your tin 261. And you'd check the money while he was there in front of him and he'd give him your tin back.

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:43.540
So was there an office at the...? Yeah, SOI pay office, yeah. Pay office? Yeah. And was that usually women doing that or...? There was a girl there but she was only checking, I think she must have been checking to pay Margaret Edwards her name was, she married her, her sister married Roscoff. Yeah. And Mr Brooks was the wages manager, I can't remember his name.

00:30:43.540 --> 00:31:11.540
So you mentioned William Lewis who was a good driver. John Lewis. John Lewis. Yeah. Why was he a good driver? Well he was a happy-go-lucky sort of a fella. He wasn't too serious. Yeah. You know, he'd just give you a row if anything went wrong and if he forgot sort of thing. Yeah. Did you have to keep on your side of the...? No, no. That was just we used to make sense. Sometimes he'd do a bit of firing and I'd do a bit of driving or something like that. Oh really? Yeah, he used to change over but not officially. No.

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:40.540
No. So, so, you know, you see these classic shots of, you know, men with their caps leaning out. Oh that's, that's a driver that is. Yeah. So have you ever done that? I have done it, yeah. But not officially. No, not officially. No, because I had finished, the steam had finished before I had made a driver. Yeah. I just drove on the diesel locomotives, that's all. So, but, so working as a fireman. Yeah. On the footplates, that looks right, correct. Yes, that's a correct tube, yeah.

00:31:40.540 --> 00:32:10.540
So, you were exposed to all the elements? Oh yes, yes. So did you? Yeah, well, yeah, we used to, but you used to know exactly where you were by just looking out. There used to be a gap between the engine and the tender. But if you looked, if you was firing, you was down in that position, you'd look out and you'd know exactly where you was by, through that little gap. Because you knew it all, you'd done it thousands of times. Really? Yeah. You'd done it thousands of times. You'd know exactly where you were. Well, you could nearly tell by the pull of the

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:40.540
engine. Did you, was it dirty work? I mean, you know, the smut and. Not, yes, it was dirty work, yeah. Yeah. Especially on that job I was on about with the bankers, where you used to have to go up behind the train, because it was only a narrow tunnel and the tunnel would be full of smoke. Yeah. But we had to go down on the floor to get our breath, to keep our breath. Did you? Yeah. Because it would be that smoky and now you wouldn't be able to see your mate across the footpath.

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:56.540
He'd be down on his hands and knees as well. He just pushed the regulator up, flat out, and just push up behind him. Did you ever blow the whistle? Yeah. Yeah, we never blew the whistle on that occasion, but you used to have to blow the whistle when you were ready behind. Really?

00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:20.540
Yeah, you'd blow one crow. It was called one crow. Cock-a-doodle-doo. Doot, doot, doot, doot, doot. Oh, really? Yeah. That was a crow. If it was two crows, if you wanted water or something, you'd say two crows. And the signalman would know that you wanted to go in for water. Oh, really? At the next signal box, yeah. Oh, there was a whistle code. So, is that something you had to learn?

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:36.540
Well, you'd use the driver, you'd know it automatically as part of the road, you know, you'd know the road then. That was all the signals and where they were placed, etc. And that would be learning the road.

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:41.540
This sounds like a silly question, so forgive me. So, did you have to start the fire in the engine every day?

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:53.540
No, somebody did. Yeah. I was a firelighter's job. That's another job? Yeah. Oh my goodness, there's so many different roles. Exactly, yeah. So, why did you jump from cleaner to fireman?

00:33:54.540 --> 00:34:20.540
Fireman, because you had a special role of a firelighter. He used to go in the cab, in the firebox, and he'd start like a little fire with paper, oily waste, what you'd clean the engine with the day before, some kindling wood on there. Then he'd start the fire, and then he'd put coal around it and build it up and build it up. And then he'd get out to the firebox then and he'd have your fire laid for you.

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:37.540
Oh my goodness, it's like coming home to your fireman. Yeah, you had fire droppers. He was the people who used to drop your fires. Clear out the ash? Yeah, clear out the ash after you'd finished with the locomotive. That was a fire dropper? Yeah. Did he do it from underneath?

00:34:37.540 --> 00:35:05.540
No, he'd done it with a big shovel off the footplate and then he'd throw it out through the side of the locomotive. Really? Yeah. You don't remember any fire droppers' names? No. Well, I know Bill Marnie used to do it, but Die Wall Banks, they're all gone. Firelighters and fire droppers? Yeah, well, they weren't only that. There was hundreds of jobs. There was coalmen. They'd be the men who'd call the locomotive up.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:36.540
They'd fill it up? Yeah. They'd have a big truck of coal up in the coal bunker. Then they'd fill a little tram and they'd tip it into your bunker. Why? Yeah, oh, there was hundreds of jobs. It's amazing. Yeah, there was a toolman and there was a man who was in charge of the tools because you'd issue you with a bucket of tools. Yeah. And in the bucket of tools there'd be a flat feeder, a round feeder.

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:58.540
A flare lamp, a gauge spanner. Yeah. All different bits of kit in a bucket and the toolman would give you that. So the toolman didn't come on the train then? No, no, he'd just be in charge of the tools. Well, he wasn't in charge of the tools, he was the toolman, Jimmy Hill.

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:27.540
So when you pulled into station? Yeah. No, when you booked on. You'd book on for your duty, you'd read your notices. Yeah. And then you'd go and get your bucket of tools. Oh my! And then you'd carry your bucket of tools back to the form and they'd give you the number of your engine, 28147 or whatever it was. And then you'd go and get a bucket of coal for 2813 and carry it back to your locomotive and then you'd prepare your locomotive then. Wow.

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:45.540
And the driver would oil, he'd go round oiling everything and we'd go round and pick the true headlights was trimmed, we had a gauge light, that was trimmed and set, pull the paraffin. What, on the front of the train? Yes. That was your only light?

00:36:46.540 --> 00:37:04.540
Yes, that was only an headlight, it wasn't a light, it was just an headcord it was, because every different trains had different headcords. Oh really? Yeah. To identify them. Yes, if it was a headlight on both sides it was an express. On both. Yeah, I know what you mean.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:18.540
And if it was one up on the left that would be a stopping train and one right would be a, and then we'd have two in the middle and that would be a goods train. Then you'd have a stopping goods train which would be two lights on the other side.

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:29.540
So when you were working, when you first started, I mean for me now, see I never knew steam trains, but did it, am I thinking of how romantic it must have been actually?

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:46.540
It was hard work, it was romantic, it was good comradery, they were good friends, they were good people to work with, yeah. But it was hard work, it wasn't easy work because as I say you had to keep at it.

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:55.540
Physically hard. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean, another silly question, forgive me, but did the fire ever go out?

00:37:55.540 --> 00:38:05.540
No. No. What would have happened? Did it ever happen? Well you'd keep it, you'd just keep it in wouldn't you? If you was working it'd be white hot all the time. Yeah.

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:23.540
But then if you were stood in the sidings you wouldn't put, you'd let it die down so the water wouldn't boil and then blow away. They used to have it. They'd dampen it down. Yeah, not dampen it down, you just, say it would go in like from you to say Swindon. Yeah.

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:44.540
You'd say, you'd know that you were going to go in the loop then, we'll say at Pilnion. Yeah. So you'd let the fire drop back a little bit and fill the boiler up and then once it was ready to go you'd stir it up again and get it going and then you'd be gone for another couple of minutes. That was all part of knowing the job.

00:38:44.540 --> 00:39:13.540
Was it heavy unionised then? Oh yes, yes, very heavy unionised, yes. Yeah. So you were a paid up member? Yes, I was a, as left that was, we'd been on strike a dozen times. Did you? Yeah. I said to everybody that amazed me how Pam used to manage. Really? Yeah. When there was a strike? Yeah. We went through a period, we were out two years, we were on three day week.

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:33.540
Was that in the 70s? Yes. Yeah, I remember the three days. Well then I was only bringing home £8 a week. Why? For two years? Yeah, when we was on strike then he was only getting £1 a day strike pay. So he was only bringing £5, I managed with, I brought two children up with that.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:40:03.540
Yeah. Must have been really, yeah. You said that's all there is then you'd learn to manage. Yeah. But if you had gone to work then you would have been a black leg? Yes, yes. Yeah. Yeah, there was only one chap here where he had a black leg at Severn Duddel and he was your only one. What happened to him was he? Well he was sent to Coventry and he was outcast virtually. That must have been difficult. Very. Yeah, yeah. It was very difficult for him.

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:32.540
If you had to work with him. Because I had no option, if I was told to work with him I had to work with him. Yeah. What happened then? Just wouldn't speak that's all. Really? Well he wouldn't speak? Oh he'd tell you but you'd ignore him. Oh because if you had spoken to him then you would have been seen. Yeah, we'd have been as bad as him. Oh God. No that was, that's just it. Right. So this would have been the 70s, there was so much striking. Yes, there was, yes. That was Jim Callaghan wanted and Ted Ethan. Yeah. Is that when we had the paracuts as well? Yes, three day week.

00:40:33.540 --> 00:41:03.540
He was only having electric for three days a week weren't you love? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's pitch black wasn't it. It sounds ridiculous now doesn't it when you think of electric. Yeah, yeah. It does yeah. I was no electric or anything. I remember toasting fire over the fire, toast sorry, over the fire. Yeah. So what about the Rocket Hotel, did you ever go there? Yes. Yeah. We went there, we used to go there regularly after the railway was shut down.

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:33.540
After we finished on the railway it was a wonderful building. Yeah, it's gorgeous. Why it's gone to the, well it hasn't gone to Rack and Ruin, it's wonder nobody developed it. It did. It's a wonderful, it could be wonderful four flats you could move. Yeah. What was it like then at the pub in the hotel? Oh it was good, it was excellent. We used to have our own pigeon club there when we first started in 58. Did you? Yeah. So that's how long you've been raising pigeons? Yes. Since 58? Yes, roughly yeah. Oh crikey. Well my father wouldn't tolerate them. What pigeons?

00:41:33.540 --> 00:42:03.540
No. So as soon as I started work I could do my pigeons. So how many of the other members were in the railways, working on the railway? Not all that many actually was there. No there wasn't many of us. There was Bob White, he used to work at the Cambrian. I can't think. There wasn't all that many railwaymen in it because Charlie Reek was in it and his son, well no he wasn't, his son came out

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:33.540
after Charlie died. But yeah no there was only a few railwaymen in it. Someone told me that there used to be a... We used to take our railway, the pigeon baskets to the railway station. Yeah. To be weighed, to train. We used to want pigeon specials then. We used to have train loads of pigeons. Pigeon specials? Yeah. Oh I've never heard that before. Well there used to be a box, a van, a little van on the tail end of the passenger trains and they used to go to Newport

00:42:33.540 --> 00:43:03.540
and they'd all be shunted into Newport, into one train. Yeah. There'd be a wagon from Avedranys, a wagon from Triavod up in the Rhondda, there'd be a wagon from Caerphilly and then it'd all get shunted at Newport into a pigeon train and then you'd work the pigeon special to Shrewsbury on. Really? Yeah. Oh that's hilarious. I think we had pigeon specials at Severntunnel. We used to unload them at Severntunnel and let them go. What to start the race? Yeah. What did they do?

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:13.540
Did the railway men open the baskets? Yeah we used to help but we weren't our job but we used to help do it, yeah. But the station staff used to do it. Because there used to be thousands of baskets.

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:14.540
Why I mean that's just. It'd all be in a basket, they would have about 30 birds in a basket about a metre square and then they used to stack them up in the wagons and then they'd unload them all and put them on top of each other and then they'd liberate them. Then you'd cut the strings and you'd all hold, say about, say you'd hold six, one's with your knees, some with the front of your legs and then when the man that was in charge said go, you'd just hold your hands

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:59.540
and the baskets would drop and you'd stand and all the pigeons would go by you. That's a real sign isn't it of how much that sport is, yeah, would you see anything like that today? No. It'd all be individual lorries.

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:19.540
Yeah, yeah. Do you remember a minor bird at the Rocket Hotel? Yes. A yellow, a black bird it was, I think that was owned by, oh I can't remember who the landlord was, Bill Thomas was in, no. Bill Thomas was the landlord here at once and there was.

00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:41.540
Was he a rude bird, somebody was. Yeah, he was like a Iver Coles' parrot down in the village. Iver Coles used to have a munger shop and he had a parrot down there, Polly. What, here? In Calicut, yeah. Really? Yeah. You heard me say, Polly a bastard. Polly a bastard.

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:42.540
Oh my God. Oh, it was a cork and Iver Coles' parrot, well everybody talked to Iver Coles' parrot. How long ago was this? Years ago, wasn't it? Yeah, I remember the parrot down in the village. He's got to be in the 60s or 70s. He was in a munger shop eventually wasn't he? Yeah. But he was an iron munger, Iver Coles, he was a pigeon flayer as well, Iver Coles. Yeah. So, do you remember the moves by Dr Beeching?

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:39.540
To change things. Oh yes, 1960s, that was, yeah. What was the feeling in Manx Railway? Well, it was a lot of sadness really but there was nothing we could do. It's the same as everything else. We'd strike, we'd done on strike against it I believe but nothing would come of it. He was done and that was it. Well you had Marples, didn't you, involved which was a transport manager and he was a big investor in lorries.

00:45:39.540 --> 00:46:08.540
Oh really? Yeah. Oh I didn't realise that. Ernie Marples, yeah. Right. Him and Beeching together. So, did you ever do the Wye Valley line for example? Yes, yes. What, through to Ross and then on to Hereford? No. No. We used to go as far as Monmouth. Oh did you? Yeah. Along by the river? Yes, right up through Redbrook. Yeah. We used to branch off at Wye Valley Junction which was Chepstow. Yeah. Then you go up the bank there and the Tidnum was the first halt. Yeah.

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:39.540
Then you'd drop down through the tunnel, the Tintin. Yeah. Then you'd go along there, you'd have St Breville's. Yeah. Redbrook. Yeah. All stations. Yeah. And then you'd have Wysham and then you'd go into Monmouth Troy. Yeah. And then Monmouth May Hill. Oh my god. There were two stations in Monmouth. And you actually did that? Yes, yeah. Gosh. Yes I do, yeah. Go in there, yeah. What was it like? Oh well, we used to call it the

00:46:39.540 --> 00:47:09.540
Elver Special. All the school kids used to go on it on the Elver Special. Yeah. That was about 8 o'clock in the morning that was. There was a lot of people around here then, landowners, sons went to Monmouth School. Yes. It was a posh school in there. Yes, still is. So they all used to catch the training from different alts on their way up. I'd never heard that before. Yeah. So why the Elver Special? Well because there was a lot of Elvers, they used to do a lot of Elvering up the Wye.

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:39.540
Yeah. And so they used to call it the Elver Special. Did you ever get any Elvers? I got a lot of Elvers, yeah, but I've never caught them myself because I've never been that way inclined. But I have eaten Elvers. Yeah. What about salmon? Get any salmon from the Wye? No. No. Don't bother with that very much. They're too precious I suppose. I was talking to another, somebody who lives in Redwick and his dad was a driver, engine driver, and he was saying that when his dad used to do the Wye Valley line,

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:48.540
and then he used to, was he a fireman? He used to push big lumps of coal out at certain places and go back in the car and pick the coal up.

00:47:48.540 --> 00:48:02.540
He used to do that for different people. Oh yeah, he used to stop sometimes and cut bean sticks. Oh I love this. It was fantastic, really.

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:32.540
Oh yeah, there was Aaron Cocker and he was always after his bean sticks at the Wye Valley. So he'd say there's a nice riddle wood there, so he'd go and cut it and he'd leave it then and it'd be an axe handle. He'd say that would be an axe handle in a few years' time and he'd leave that there and he'd cut it and leave it where it was. Really? Yeah. So how could you stop the train with passengers on? Oh we didn't used to stop when there were passengers on. Oh right. No, we used to do it when we had goods. Freight, yeah. Oh, really?

00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:54.540
Oh, crikey, that's amazing. So do you remember, you know, extreme weather conditions, say the winter of 62, 63 and on the trains and that sort of thing? Yeah, but it was bad, but it wasn't so bad on the trains because we used to, well you had to wait, didn't you, to keep it going sort of thing. Yeah.

00:48:54.540 --> 00:49:10.540
Yeah, but it didn't bother us all that much. He was getting to and from work was the hardest part. Yeah. But other than that, we didn't notice it all that much. We only stayed at home because we used to have to queue up for bread and all that, didn't we love? Put a stel, yeah.

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:32.540
That's right, shoot us in the kids now. That was a bad winter too, that one. Yeah. But do you know the, you know, the rogget to the marshaling yard, there's really not much indication that it was a massive hub. None at all, hardly, no. No? So can you kind of describe it, what was it like?

00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:46.540
Well it was busy, very busy. It was, well there was a devoted lot of people doing the shunting etc, like Terry and all them, their shunters were absolutely brilliant.

00:49:46.540 --> 00:50:07.540
Because some nights down on Atmo's, when the wind, the rain had been coming in level, you had a real nasty night and they were blowing off that seven and they'd be all doing all the shunting and they'd have the sowesters on and leather, they all had leather, not leather, like waterproof. Yeah.

00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:27.540
They didn't have posh clothes then, they used to have a sowester and an oil coat, like you know. They used to get the shunting done, it used to be done. It was a dangerous job though. Oh it was, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, Terry was talking about somebody he knew who had lost both legs. Yeah, Johnny Crump. Yeah.

00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:40.540
He was a runner, they used to have runners then, that was the people who'd run after them, I'm not telling you about them wagons, but they'd let them go at the top, but then somebody would have a runner running after them then to put the brakes on.

00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:56.540
And they used to knock the brake out of the rack, put a brake stick and then sit on the brake stick to slow the wagon down. My God. Because the wagon, it would just crash into the wagon in front, so you had to have a brakesman.

00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:17.540
I wonder how many got injured? Oh quite a few, it was easy to fall off them and slippery. Yeah, crazy. Running on the ends of, yeah a lot of them. There was about eight brakesmen, no, four or five brakesmen on each shift, that was fifteen of them in a day. Yeah. On both sides.

00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:38.540
Yeah, so it was exceptional this place then, wasn't it? It was, yeah, it was huge. Yeah. There was about ten reception roads, that's where you used to pull your train in, wherever you brought the train from, you'd bring it to one of the amp and then you'd cut the engine off, or the shunter'd cut the engine off and you'd go to the shed.

00:51:38.540 --> 00:52:07.540
Well then they'd push that train then, shunter'd, and went wherever direction they wanted the wagons to go. Why? And that was continuous. We sometimes, we used to be blocked back right away, Dr. Lang weren't waiting to get in on the amp. Really? Yeah. That's a long way. It is, yeah. Yeah, I've had eight hours on a train and I've moved. Wow. Yeah. We're just waiting for the shunter. For the shunter to go ahead in front of you, yeah. The wagons, so that would give you some indication how busy it was. Yeah.

00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:37.540
It was such a busy place, so much coming through it. Oh, it was unbelievably busy, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, did you have much to do with Langwerth then? Did you ever bring in the two Langwerth? No, we built, we took most of the stuff in to build it. Did you? Yeah. Were there tracks up there? They built the tracks in there and we took the tracks in and done everything by rail. Really? Except for the shale lorries, they used to have shale lorries then, but everything else was taken in by rail, yeah. So did they build the tracks by rail? Yeah.

00:52:38.540 --> 00:53:08.540
By rail, especially? Yes. Yeah. Oh. Yeah, well, they had a special platform down the far end at the Queen when she opened it for her to get off. Oh, yes, yes, I've seen that. Yeah. Oh, my goodness. Were you there that day? Yeah, no, I wasn't there that day, but I was on the railway that time, yeah. Oh, gosh. Yeah. So, I mean, it must have been hundreds of trains going back and forth. Hundreds of trains virtually, yeah. Big operation. Huge. Yeah. Huge operation. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you know,

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:38.540
I think about the Royal train? Not a lot, no. Yeah. Not a lot. Someone said there was a siding where they. Oh, yeah, I was up at Port Scowett that one. Yeah, the Royal train siding, yes. Yeah. Yeah, that might still be there now, but she doesn't go, she goes to Beasley now up at. Oh, really? Up the, when they put the Royal train up the branch, Beasley branch up there. So, so then you moved on to when it turned to diesel. Yeah. Do you remember when that happened? Yeah.

00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:58.040
Yes, I wouldn't, well, it was between 66 and 70. Yeah. When steam was phased out. And what was the feeling about the change? Well, it wasn't, it wasn't all that bad actually, because it was still the same, but then when they started to change it, they were trying to do away with the second man.

00:53:58.040 --> 00:53:59.040
Well, eventually we went on strike for that and they got rid of the second man. That was in the 70s as well. Oh, really? Yeah, and then you had guards then the next move was to get rid of the guards and we had single manning. So at the end of the day, when I was a driver, you only had one man on the train. Yeah. But as we used to have three. Wow, gosh, they got rid of the firemen. And the guard, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So the strikes didn't stop.

00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:40.540
They didn't really do much. Nothing at all. Nothing at all. And they've given all, that's all gone now, but they've got a good salary now. That's what. Yeah. Yeah. So what was it like driving a diesel train? Was it?

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:40.740
No, it was good. It was all right. It was cold sometimes, perishing cold. Why? Well, because the eaters weren't sufficient for the, you know, the drafts. They were all drafty. They were all drafty, all things, they were. They were all right, yeah. Was there a big camaraderie amongst you all? Oh, wonderful camaraderie, yeah, there still is. No, we still have gatherings now. Oh, do you? Yeah. Yeah. We have gatherings, they were up a couple of miles a month. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that
