00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
My mother was hell-bent that us three would get an education, you know, and if they

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.600
Not to marry because otherwise what like I was thinking what life would have been like if I was still in Africa

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.240
Would I be married with two three children, but no education?

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.060
You know, what would my life have been like? I don't know

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.440
And here my mother said out, you know, she wouldn't even teach us how to cook

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.480
I said, can you teach us how to cook? No, no go study study. I want you to get out

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.320
I want you to go and get educated so you stand on your own two feet. You never depend on anyone ever

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.720
Am I am I as resilient as I

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.280
As I was then I think then

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.480
Now I feel I feel

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.840
Not so strong

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.520
Maybe I'm getting older I don't know but then it was like a big adventure, you know

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.840
Everything was an adventure. I treated it like an adventure. I think I wouldn't have survived

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.380
If I hadn't been so resilient and I think it's thanks to my mom who is just tell me go

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.320
You you you don't need to depend on anyone. You need to go stand on your own two feet. I always remember that

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Go
