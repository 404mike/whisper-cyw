00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
Another group of songs which are quite often called sea shanties but in fact

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.560
they're ballads, they're story songs. Sea shanties were meant to do work.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.120
They got a very close beat for pulling ropes or working a capstan. It's all

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.840
from the days when people used to have sailing ships and they didn't have any

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:26.040
engines at all. So you had to either have manpower or wind power.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.160
If you can get a good sea shanty going then it would increase the pulling power

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.320
of a crew by about 10 to 15 percent which was not to be sniffed at. It was

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.720
worth doing. And also because they would be on board together as a

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.120
group for maybe a month, two months, three months or a year sometimes. But that guy

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.240
used to go around to South America, Lotte Park, the guy who bought Lotte Park in

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.280
town here. It took six months to go there. So if you're together for

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.920
six months then it's nice to have a couple of songs you can sing together

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.800
and be more sociable. So it was a way of being sociable as well. Usually

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.560
they were pretty risque sort of songs. They were sort of making fun of

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.280
people or talking about the girls they got and so on. So it makes it makes a

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.800
bit an interesting bit of oral history. It's good oral history.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.200
Some are in Welsh like the collection I've got here and some are in English

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.200
and some relate to fish goud, some relate to the trade and so on. If you look at

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.600
history lots of communities used to have work songs but they've all disappeared.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.000
The sea shanties are probably the last of these work songs.
