00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So we were in Cardiff and there I went to Haralds School, which is an excellent school.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I don't know how my mother heard that this was the best school, but it clearly was.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And they must have scint and scraped. I had some sort of a scholarship, but nevertheless they had something to pay.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But you know Jewish people value education very highly and they felt it was a sacrifice worth making.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So apart from the odd race, the first I knew really seriously about the war was the day I became 16.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And I think at 16 I became an enemy alien.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Up until then I'd been a child, but when you were 16 you were an enemy alien.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And I had to go and report to the police.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And my fellow pupils just laughed me out of it and said, don't worry, we know you're not an enemy alien.
