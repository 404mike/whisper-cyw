A lot, a lot smoked. I think generally most people, you know, even, you know, I started

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:15.040
smoking there, you know, I mean I don't smoke now, but that's where, you know, you'd sit

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.880
down with patients and it would be a way of communicating and I think we smoked, you know,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.440
in offices like this office we're sitting in now, I think back now. It was almost like

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.760
a given. Most of my colleagues smoked and most of the patients smoked. There was a hospital

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.640
shop. No, you could actually go and buy five at a time, you know, and that used to open

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.960
on a Wednesday afternoon or maybe a Saturday afternoon.
