WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620
go to Christmas parties and stuff.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.400
Actually, we went to a Christmas party last week.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.100
Yeah, we're in Moody Cow.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.100
And yeah, it was a Mencap Christmas party.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.800
It was quite fun, actually.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.800
In parties, we just pull crackers, have a chat,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.760
and there's a disco at the end.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.340
Have food.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.220
Turkey.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.540
Christmas dinner, yeah.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.120
Every year, yeah.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.800
One with the Gateway Club,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.520
which I'm a member of as well.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.680
And that's in the football club.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.800
Yeah, I've been going there a few years.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.480
There's loads of activities going on.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.720
We used to go out on tricks, but we don't as much now.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.720
All our activities really are in the football club now.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.120
It's in Aberystwyth.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.680
It's quite a few of us.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.180
They're all friends of mine.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.600
No, they're all friends.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.120
A couple of years ago, we had Gateway's Got Talent,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.040
where we used to tell jokes, mainly me.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.680
People singing.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.440
I was living back in Cwmrydol anyway.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.080
So did you go back because of the pandemic then?

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.120
Yeah.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.560
Ah, you went to be with your family.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.720
My family, yeah.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.040
For me, it's fine going to parents

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.280
for a couple of weeks or something,

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.960
but I couldn't really talk with it for that long.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.520
Yeah, it was hard, yeah.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.520
The whole COVID time was a Mencap quiz,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.240
but I didn't get involved in that much.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.920
What was it then?

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.640
I'm not really, it was on Zoom or something.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.640
I'm hopeless on Zoom, we'll be honest.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.000
Yeah, and do they not use computers?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.840
No.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.680
No.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.520
No.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.240
Got by strange, yeah.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.680
It was strange at first to come back,

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.160
but it was good.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.960
There used to be a guy called Colin Hunt.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.960
I was the Gateway boss, I guess, at the time,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.680
but he's retired now.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.640
The only trip we've been to since is

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.440
Wiltshire Safari Park.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.840
But when Colin was with us,

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.080
we used to go to what's the state,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.360
it's Crow in Cardiff.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.160
We used to go a few years.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.360
We went on loads of trips,

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.920
group of us all together.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.440
I'm an occasional radio presenter as well,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.360
with radio broadcasts.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.000
Well, at the moment, it's just once a week,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.520
because it's just on a Saturday at the moment.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.480
For that, I used to do stuff for the Radio,

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.080
I answered the phones for Radio Carradighian as well.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.720
We used to do a program called Isn't Life Fun?

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.760
And which was interviews and music

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.120
and well, me doing sport really.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.760
But I think that was stopped because of the,

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.040
I think it was because of the pandemic.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.560
We haven't gone back to it since.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.400
Now I do help out in the presenting stuff.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.960
Done actually,

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.680
interviewing as well.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.440
To be honest, I never did when I was in Radio Carradighian.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.000
So that's, it was a different thing for me that, but.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.080
Yeah, very little, really.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.440
So they made it accessible, did they?

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.520
Yeah.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.360
And you opened it?

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.800
I opened it.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.640
What was that like?

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.640
Oh, that was amazing.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.960
That was good, yeah, actually.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.920
It was amazing.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.280
What would you want people to understand about your life?

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.720
I suppose the difficulty,

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.720
because it sometimes is, of a disabled person.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.240
Is Aberystwyth quite accessible or not?

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.400
It's not great, no, but yeah,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.560
there's pavements, it's not great, yeah.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.320
It's getting better, don't get me wrong, but yeah,

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.720
still a few challenges, I guess.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.560
I love being in my cap.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.760
Yeah, we do loads of activities and stuff, yeah.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.440
And do you speak Welsh?

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.120
Yes, first language.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.200
And do any of the staff speak Welsh here?

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.480
Not at the moment, no.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.760
And what about in the gateway?

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.080
Most speak English, well, pretty much,

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.200
they all do speak English.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.960
And in the day centre, do the staff speak Welsh at all?

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.520
No, no.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.600
Do you have many friends who speak Welsh?

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.080
No.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.440
There's a couple here in Aber,

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.760
but Jan's first language as well.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.040
So you speak Welsh to her?

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.320
Yes.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.000
As I say, I'm okay with Welsh or English, I don't mind.
