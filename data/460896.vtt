00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I wasn't living in Wales, I was living in Cambridge.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And that's got a big bearing on this.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Because I think Welsh people who live outside of Wales, or on the fringes of Wales,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
have a very different attitude to Wales than people who live inside Wales.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And the most fanatic nationalists I've met in my life are all those expatriates.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And they're usually the ones who've got these wonderful accents like this and say,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Oh, I love coming to Cardiff for the game.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I'll have to be on the six o'clock train to get back to Paddington.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Off they go.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
But they love Wales.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I mean, I was living about as far from Wales as you can get in Cambridge.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
But I was coming home a lot.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Because my PhD research was, well, at least some of it was done here.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
A lot of it was in the public records office in Cambridge itself, in the university library and stuff.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So I was in contact with a lot of people down here.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And at the time, the people I knew were mainly opposed to devolution.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Like most of the Labour Party in Wales, for example, led by Neil Kinnock.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And in fact, Paul Murphy has got, to this day, the lists of everybody who gave money for the No campaign.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And by 1997, 1998, they were almost entirely the people who were giving money to the Yes campaign.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I'm not sure what that tells you, but I just thought you ought to know that as an historian.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Led by people like Ron Davis, who were vociferously anti-devolution in 1970.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And I'm vociferously pro-devolution.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And I'm a vociferously pro-devolution in 1997.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Do you have your own theory of why there was such a shift, especially with the Labour Party?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I think it may have had something to do with Thatcherism, really.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
But I'm not convinced of that, by the way.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And if it did, then it was a really foolish thing.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Because the idea that you can somehow cushion yourself from the blows of the British state if you don't have independence, I think is a complete fallacy.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And sooner or later, the Assembly in Cardiff has been bankrolled massively.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
But pretty soon that money is going to dry up.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And then, the reality checkpoint occurs.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
That's why I feel very uneasy about this referendum.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Because I think it's a bit of a cheat, really.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
It ought to be about, do you want tax raising powers?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Do you want independence?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I mean, I'm not sure that kind of fanning around with relatively trivial bits of legislation means anything to anybody.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I don't really understand it, to be honest with you.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I think it's quite a complicated kind of mechanical device that's used to devolve some legislative powers.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I just can't get a head of steamer about it, one way or another.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
But anyway, why did they change? I don't know.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I mean, it was always a kind of old Labour Party, certainly since the debates with George and so on.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And the whole discussion about what you do about trying to realise some aspirations that aren't shared in other parts of the United Kingdom.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
I mean, that becomes something quite special.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I don't remember those debates, really, in the 1970s.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I think it was a very different kind of campaign.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And also, by the way, it was one that I was very much at arm's length from, just because of personal circumstances.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I think if I'd have been living here, I'd be much more involved in it than I was.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
But it wasn't very important to me, really.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
But I do remember it, and I do remember making some speeches in favour of devolution.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I think I still harboured suspicions about the British state and about the strange reaction to the bombers during the investiture campaign.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And the worries that there was going to be another Northern Ireland and all of this stuff.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And I've never really resolved that in my own mind.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.000
I'm not sure if the British state, such as it is, are knowing it a bit better than I did then.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I'm not sure that there is such a thing as the British state.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:49.000
But that established government was particularly worried about what was going on in Wales during the investiture.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And worried about it enough to think, well, we'd better give them something during the debate on devolution in the 70s.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.000
I guess my argument is a pretty crude one, really, which is you can never out-nationalists.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And it doesn't matter what interim measure you give them, they'll always want independence.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
That's as simple as that. And I think it's a very honest position, actually.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I've never really been able to get beneath the logic of what the Scottish nationalists had done.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And my old buddy David Ellis Thomas has tried time and again to explain to me what his position is on this.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
But I'm not sure if I understand it.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I love him dearly, though I do.
