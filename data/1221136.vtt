00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
Because I could read Hebrew and it wasn't a big deal for me except when you're by

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.680
Midsford you read from the scrolls in the synagogue and the scrolls don't have

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.960
any vowels, commas, full stops, question marks, they don't have anything where you

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.440
could change the way you say things and you've got to learn it and you've got to

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:28.880
sing it because each word has a note and you've got to learn the songs and you've

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.840
got to know it and I spent a whole year being taught the wrong thing. When they

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.400
told me what I've got to learn not only was it that but it was two of them

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:45.400
because that week there are what we call a two sedras, two portions of the law and

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.160
I had to learn the two but I only had six weeks to do it where it had taken me

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.560
a year to do just one but I did it. When my family came my father was one of

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.120
seven brothers and two sisters they were all there except him because he died and

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.160
that was my bar Midsford.
