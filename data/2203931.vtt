00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800
For our alibi, recording Mr Preet Munaram on the 7th of March 2024.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.040
Hi Preet, tell me about your father's life in Mauritius.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:24.800
Right, my father was the eldest of seven children and he lived in a place called Cupid in Mauritius.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:35.040
He was born on the 7th of May 1932. He was a very hard working young man and tried his hand at

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:45.200
everything. Sport, education, he had an extreme thirst for knowledge. Books, surrounded himself

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:54.240
with books and being the eldest of a family where their father had died when they were quite young,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:01.120
he became the breadwinner. He spent very little of his childhood in his mother's house. He was

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:10.800
living with his uncle who lived 13 miles away from the family home. So my dad had a 13 mile cycle trip

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:19.360
to school every day. He won what was called an open scholarship to attend the Royal College in Cupid,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.000
which was a fee-paying school but he won an open scholarship. He came from quite a poor background

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.480
as you can imagine but he was the highest scoring pupil on the whole of the island.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.480
So he won this scholarship to go to the school. Whilst he was a pupil there, he was very

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:45.840
entrepreneurial and started giving private lessons to boys and girls who quite didn't reach the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.960
expectation that they were supposed to but had a bit of money.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.520
And he helped fund the education of his siblings. He was quite strict with his siblings and insisted

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.240
that they, boys and girls, both insisted that both of them complete school to at least A level.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:14.160
And testimony to that is that the four brothers all embarked on different professions, accountant,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:23.120
headmaster of a school, surgeon and my dad doing what he did. The girls became school teachers

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.000
and headmistresses of various schools, which was quite rare really in the 50s and early 60s.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:39.040
After finishing school at the age of 18, my dad decided to work for a while because he had to

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.360
raise money to come to Britain and to take a degree. He'd applied to study medicine in

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.800
St Andrews in Edinburgh and his plan was that it would take him about 10 years to raise sufficient

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:00.240
funds to fund his course and fund his time in Britain. In the meantime of course he met my

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:08.000
mother and life takes on a different course. They got married. My mum came from quite a very

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.640
quite a wealthy background and it was a match made in heaven actually because

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.040
they would both be sotted with each other from the moment they met. It was a love marriage,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:33.040
not arranged, you know, contrary to the normal Asian expectation of life. And they were happily

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:43.440
married until his death in 1990, sorry 2001. My father continued to work then in Mauritius. He

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.720
taught in a Church of England school called St Andrews where he taught sciences and English

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:58.480
and French to write up to Cambridge certificate A level. And funny enough some of the pupils in

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.600
there were his siblings in that school and various other family members who all remember him with

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:15.520
affection. He was very keen on school sports days, extracurricular activities like boy scouts. My mum

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:25.040
was involved with the guides and he raised the expectations of the children he came across to

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:33.280
expect be the best they could. And years later you meet people who've said that's what he did for us.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:41.760
He was passionate about teaching, absolutely passionate about it. Then he was due to come to

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:50.160
Britain in 1957. Unfortunately the island was hit by a cyclone and as you can see from this

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:57.040
photograph here our house was demolished by cyclone Carroll. That's my dad standing amongst

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.760
the ruins and he spent the next five years earning enough money to rebuild the house,

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:12.880
in which time my brother and myself were born. So that changed plans completely. His chances of

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.080
doing medicine as he saw it had gone out of the window because in those days it took seven years

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.400
and that was just far too long. By the time he was coming to Britain he was 30 years of age and

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:32.240
he decided seven years in higher education wouldn't be feasible. So he supported his younger brother

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:39.440
who went to Trinity in Dublin to study medicine and my dad followed a few years later and went

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:47.680
to Cardiff University. However before going there my mother and myself were sent over

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:55.840
with my elder brother to Britain to acclimatise to the weather over here. My dad decided that we

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:03.680
should come over in June of 1962 as it was still the British summer and he would follow at the end

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.760
of the term time in Mauritius and come over to start his degree in the September of that year.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:19.680
My mother, my brother, myself and a girl called Geeta came over to Britain together, my mum in

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:27.040
charge of all of us and we arrived at London Airport Heathrow, fresh off the boat as they say,

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:36.240
and we took a coach to Victoria coach station where we were met by my mother's sister who had

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:47.680
been in Britain since 1951 and she had arranged a flat for us in Bayswater and she put us into a

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:54.240
taxi and my mum met with the landlady and the landlady told my mother what the rent would be.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:01.520
My mum worked out that this would wipe out her whole year's allowance in about a month

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.880
and promptly jumped back into the taxi and we ended up back at Victoria station.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:16.560
Fortunately for us there were some former scouts of my dad who'd also arrived and they helped us

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:23.840
find some temporary accommodation in Victoria in London. Shortly after that my mum found a more

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:35.600
permanent house in Norwood Junction and we had a one-bedroomed flat. There was my mum, my brother,

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:42.640
myself and Geeta and we shared this flat for the whole of the summer of 1962 until my mum

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:48.640
arranged the wedding of Geeta with her then-husband, still of today,

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:57.440
Dale Maddew and they still very happily live in London to this day and my mum organized the wedding

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:08.000
literally a few months after arriving in Britain. Then our life in Britain began. 1962 my father

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.440
arrived in London, he moved to Cardiff to find us accommodation, he found us a flat in Richmond

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:24.560
Crescent and we all moved to Cardiff. My dad attended Cardiff University and I went to a little

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:30.560
nursery school in Richmond Road called Nurseryland. My brother went to Albany Infant School, Albany

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:38.800
Junior School and my cousin who was with us went to Rother Park and my dad attended university for

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:46.800
the year 1962 to 63 and as events happened my mum became pregnant with my youngest brother,

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:52.720
Vin and that changed everything because my dad decided that funding would be an issue because

00:08:52.720 --> 00:09:03.520
he was self-funding. So he decided to take a break from university for the academic year 1963 to 64

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:11.600
and he got the job in Hlan Wyrn in the steelworks programming computers which were very much the new

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:17.200
thing and because he was a mathematician it was second nature to him. He traveled from Cardiff to

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:27.360
Hlan Wyrn every day to do this job and in the evenings he would run the adult education department

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:36.800
at Grangetown Adult Education Centre teaching English to overseas people and he did that for

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:46.720
his entire time that he was doing his degree from 1963 to 1966. He completed it after the year of

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:52.640
Unininefmany in Hlan Wyrn, he came back to his studies in Cardiff University and finally graduated

00:09:52.640 --> 00:10:06.240
in 1966. After graduation he couldn't get a job in education and he was working as a labourer

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:15.520
for Cardiff Corporation cutting grass and it wasn't until the former leader of the Labour Council,

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:24.240
Jack Sloan saw him cutting the grass of the mansion house and said, Rav what are you doing?

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:32.000
And my father said I'm earning money to feed my family and look after them and Jack Sloan actually

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:40.240
said well we've a teacher shortage in Cardiff, this is ridiculous. Next thing my father gets a

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:49.360
letter from the education department and he's offered a job teaching French in Sintwale High

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:56.000
School in Ely and Sintwale was a secondary modern school, quite a tough school, quite a tough area

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:06.880
but like everything he did he did it with relish and total enthusiasm and from 1967 to 1960 end of

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:15.040
1969 he taught the boys French and anything else they needed assistance with and at the end of it

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:22.960
you know some in fact 30 40 years later I met some of the pupils by pure accident from the school

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:30.160
who commented that he was one of the few teachers who taught them who treated them with any respect

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:38.640
and dignity and typical Asian he turned up every day to this school smartly dressed in a suit

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:46.960
and showed the boys they could be better than their expectations that they were led to believe by

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:53.760
their expectations they were more than limitations put upon them. Day one of the school my dad went

00:11:53.760 --> 00:12:02.480
along in his suit and briefcase always had the briefcase and he came home from from work that

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:10.080
day and he had a huge black eye and we just thought what an earth has happened you've been in a fight

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:15.600
someone of the boys didn't like took took a dislike to you and he said no I was playing football with

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:22.320
the boys in the yard and we went up to head a ball and someone's head caught me and from that day on

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:28.880
I think the boys took to him they absolutely took to him I remember going on a school trip with them

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:35.040
I was in junior school and we'd had a and my dad had organized a school trip for these boys they'd

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:40.640
never been anywhere and he'd organized because no one had trusted them to leave the city and he took

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:46.480
them to Bristol Zoo he and another teacher called John Davis and another good friend of his from

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:52.720
the school Len Williams who was the woodwork teacher John Davis was the music teacher and this

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:59.360
coach was full of boys and we turned I turned up at the school with my dad just before half past

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:05.360
eight in the morning and the school is full of you know 14 15 year old boys running around I was in

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:12.800
junior school infant school and my dad shouted out to this one boy said Churchill this is my son take

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:18.560
care of him and that's the last I saw of my dad until the coach came back from Bristol Zoo I spent

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:26.000
the whole of the day with these boys at the back of the coach for the whole of the trip and it was

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:33.360
absolutely amazing a good day out with some really special people and I won't mention what happened

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:41.200
in the gift shop though can you tell us a little bit about the reception of your father at the

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:48.160
school in Ely when he initially arrived because that was back in the days in what 1960 1969 yeah

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:55.120
yeah um initially some of the parents weren't happy with being taught having their children taught by

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:05.280
an Asian man and there was a period where um he was received or we were receiving obscene phone

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:10.640
calls on on the home telephone because all your telephone numbers were published in a phone directory

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:17.680
in those days do you know what that is a phone directory yeah um and he um people used to phone

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.640
us the police actually put a trace and they went on for quite a while and the police put a trace on

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:29.440
the line and they identified where the call was coming from and typical of my dad he didn't want

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:34.560
to press charges he just went to go and pay the parents a visit and ask them why they were doing

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:41.520
it and turn them around really just meeting them having a chat with them and it just stopped from

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:50.720
then on and so I'm sensing that he was meant met initially with some um racism and resentment

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:56.400
well I think that featured right throughout his life to be quite honest in Britain right throughout

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:05.120
his life um but it was never used as a badge for him he never used it as a reason not to be able

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:13.040
to do anything in fact he raised himself above it and everything he did he he he didn't allow

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:20.720
himself to become restrained by anything colour or being told you can't do this funding he he just

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.880
was bigger than than than his job

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:34.480
so racism wasn't really it was there it was you know it'd be stupid not to say it wasn't there

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:39.040
but um he never let it become a limiting factor on his life

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.360
life

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:54.160
yeah so moving on now to um teaching um at in a league he was also at the same time in

00:15:54.160 --> 00:16:01.040
Grange Townstall yes he was teaching adult education in the great and I have letters of

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:07.440
testimony from the warden of the centre who absolutely sends a glowing reference of him

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:15.120
um saying that um you know this man should be doing more than he is you know he shouldn't be

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:20.640
limited by the type of posts he was being offered or not offered as the case may be

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:31.520
after Ely the job in Fitzallan came up and that basically was uh in those days this was 1969

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:38.880
um there had been um a lot of children coming in from former British colonies

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:48.880
from the Indian subcontinent whose it who for whom English was a second language and for whom

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:56.480
a lot of the parents didn't speak English in the home so what South Glamorgan education department

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:02.640
Cardiff education department decided to do was to house them in one building in Fitzallan high

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:10.240
school which they very nicely called the immigrant block and it was a three or four story building

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:18.400
where all the kids from non-English speaking backgrounds were put and before my dad arrived

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.360
they were being treated as educationally so normal they were treated they were banded as

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:29.120
ESN and a lot of their day would be spent litter picking around the yard because no one knew what

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:36.000
to do with them and they were not part of mainstream school and they didn't have school

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.200
uniforms you know they weren't told to wear school uniforms you know they they didn't know what the

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:46.080
arrangements were in the school no one from the school actually directed them on that front

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:53.600
and so on my dad's first day there realizing that there may be cultural issues with teaching

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:59.680
some of the girls in school took my mum along with him and they had a conversation luckily

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:05.520
my mum speaks Urdu my dad speaks Hindi and they could communicate in some of the South

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:13.520
Asian languages South Indian languages and they were able to get across to the kids that um

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:21.040
to be part of this school we need to be look like the pupils in this school so we need to dress

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:30.560
in the same way and from then on um he called the parents in as well and actually got them on board

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:37.600
with um having school uniforms for their kids so they felt part of the school and it wasn't

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:43.440
uncommon for him because it was very they had very few teachers in the so-called immigrant block and

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:51.360
he came along um and i remember sitting on um occasional days when my dad had to look after

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:56.080
my younger brother and myself he'd take us into school with him so our occasional days off were

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:02.720
not spent at the park we'd go back to school and have the school so we'd be in this classroom and

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:09.680
on the way in my dad would always stop off at one of the shops in Grangetown and buy several bottles

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:17.280
of large bottles of pop and biscuits and crisps then we'd go into a classroom and there would be

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:27.600
something like 120 kids in one classroom of all ages ranging from 11 to almost 17 and he would

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:34.800
have them eating out of them all speaking different languages he would have them eating out of his hand

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:42.000
by the end of a sort of short session and it was just amazing you know he'd be teaching them the

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.720
same thing because they all had to learn English they all had to get on board with this and um

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:55.920
the pop and the crisps and the biscuits were for them you know in their break time and um

00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:01.360
he also thought it was important to get to the parents because he realized that he was

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:06.880
trying to teach the kids English in school they were going home and speaking in mother town

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:13.440
and the parents weren't able to communicate in English to the children so I think that's where

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:21.280
the idea of the pavilion or the parade came along teaching English as a second he'd always been

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:29.680
involved in teaching English as a second language to overseas people and he decided to contact some

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:35.600
of the parents he would go to their homes he would take my mother along and encourage them

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:44.320
to come to classes and I as a young boy of 11 12 years old I remember doing leaflet drops around

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:51.440
Grangetown and Bute town to various houses in Riverside of these English classes that

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:58.480
been run by this man Ravi Muniram in Seven Road adult community centre

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:08.160
Seven Road was a school in in Grangetown and he would run these classes every evening and

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:15.680
this was on top of the day job by the way he would run these classes and then increase the

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:22.320
staff you would get various people involved various people who studied English teaching

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:30.320
of English as a second language and things grew from there really the opportunity to take up the

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:39.600
tenure of the parade came up when Cardiff High School the girls abandoned the school in 1971

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:46.480
because they amalgamated with the boys school in T. Kelly so there was a lovely old Victorian

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:57.120
Victorian building empty on the parade literally 1971 summer 1971 and I remember receiving a phone

00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:06.960
call from my dad on the landline and he said I was 13 at the time and he said you've got a toolbox

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:12.560
have you and I said yes he said bring it over I've just taken over a building on the parade

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:19.200
it's the old Cardiff High School for girls so I went around to number 28 which was the old

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:26.880
main building of the school I walked in and literally the school had shut in at the end of

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:33.360
term in July 71 and the bins were still full of the rubbish because no one was coming back

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:42.160
so our first job was to empty the bins and clean the floors etc etc he had a caretaker there who

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:49.680
wasn't very receptive to working for my dad and who lived in the top floor of number 28 he had an

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:58.160
apartment in number 28 parade and he was not very cooperative with opening doors for functions that

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:03.920
went on there for cleaning the building for organizing cleaners cleaning stuff to come in

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:09.520
because he didn't like the idea of working for my dad so my dad quite often would be seen with a

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:15.920
brush after spending a full day teaching and a full day doing adult work sweeping the floor in

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:23.200
the parade to clean the building after it had been used and I you know I've helped him do it on occasion

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:36.480
um but on a positive note um the parade became an amazing building where at the end of his 22-23

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:44.320
years of running the place and developing it it became a hub for some 4 000 people a week

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:50.160
using it and it was people from all backgrounds all communities in life

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:57.840
you know which I can go into detail if you wish um use that building please do give us some detail

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.680
well let me pick up a photograph and have a look at this

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:14.160
this these are pictures of the summer schools that used to go on in the parade every

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:22.720
June July and August when school term finished my dad would run summer schools in the parade for

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:30.320
those kids who were struggling in various subjects in school kids from all backgrounds all communities

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:38.320
would attend this school and he did this for as long as I can remember not only that he would

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:44.400
also organize I think this picture here is actually of an exchange group um he would have

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:51.200
the exchange groups from Nantes and Stuttgart our twin cities coming over and staying for a month

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:57.040
in Britain being hosted out by various families and we on occasion hosted some of these kids who

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:02.880
would come over and they were pre-university you know they were a 17 18 year olds who were basically

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:09.840
on a holiday here but would have to spend morning of the weekday learning English as a set because

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:17.520
prior to going to their universities in Stuttgart or Germany or France you know and uh so over the

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:26.400
years um he became like a foster parent to these groups of 70 80 kids for the whole summer um I

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:34.640
tell you a story of um one night where these uh a group of German guys and girls got stuck in

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:42.160
Barry and this was pre-mobile phones so believe me it was prehistoric and we get a phone call on

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:50.800
the landline uh we're in the Barry police station I thought oh no what's going on they didn't have

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:58.480
any money and they couldn't get home so I remember ferrying these kids home I did about five trips in

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:06.160
the car to ferry them home to their various homes in around Cardiff that night and the one thing I

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:12.000
remember is I kept on asking them the time because I was frustrated and a few days later they turned

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.080
up at the house with a present of a watch for me but there we are that's another story but um

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:25.680
yeah these these photographs here they're of which there are numerous spanning various eras

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:31.760
you know we have pictures of young Vietnamese children from the first waves of immigration into

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:38.480
Britain of the so-called Vietnamese boat people and the reception that they received in the parade

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:44.640
my dad worked with the Welsh Refugee Council to make sure that people were being treated properly

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:52.400
the community the Community Relations Council the Criminal Justice Board these were just a few

00:26:52.400 --> 00:27:03.200
of the things that he did that were extracurricular um so he organized he not only hosted the kids over

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:12.480
here but he took groups of uh children from this area 18 17 18 year olds over to Stuttgart and

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:19.360
Nantes in exchange and my mum would always accompany him with that so they became like these

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:25.360
children surrogate parents on these trips and my mum quite often would come home from these trips

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:31.920
and say you know on two nights I had groups of girls in my bedroom talking about they'd fallen

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:37.840
in love with someone some French guy on the trip how were they ever going to come back to Cardiff

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.440
and my mum would be sitting there trying to console them you know

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:46.160
and the letters of thanks you would get afterwards were just incredible

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:55.200
there were other photographs there's one in here of a chap called Jürgen Gutmann with a German

00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:05.040
from I think from Stuttgart in the 1972 there was a touring company called Moral Rearmament which is

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:13.040
a big international organization and it staged a play a musical called the Song of Asia

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:18.880
and there were people from all over the world in this cast and they went touring around the world

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:24.960
with this this this musical called Song of Asia and they ended up playing in the Sherman Theatre

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:32.720
and we hosted Jürgen Gutmann um on his time here we had him staying with us for about three weeks

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:40.880
whilst the touring company was here and they he became a very good friend and uh there's just a

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:47.280
picture of him later on with his young family and his life back in Germany just saying how much it

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:55.360
meant to him to well to have been here and to get their message of moral rearmament around the uh

00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:04.160
around the world um dad was also involved with the interfaith associations where um the the church

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:10.800
the leaders of various religious groups would meet in the parade rabbis imams priests vickers

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:18.160
reverends you name it they would meet and you know talk about issues of the day and go back to their

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:24.800
various religious organizations and disseminate what they'd heard in the parade and

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.760
meeting other people it was a forum where people could come together

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:38.320
and be open-minded which was what which is if you look at the world now we could do with a bit of

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:46.000
that now a little bit of understanding a little bit of um respect for other people's viewpoint

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:53.040
a little bit of compassion i think that summed up the parade really and summed up certainly summed

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:59.520
up my dad well i was going to say that they're they're your father reverend moonram and 28th

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:06.000
parade are kind of inextricable but i would like to uh pull them in tees and apart slightly so i

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:15.280
think one of things that um i'm hearing really is that um your father was a powerhouse and a pioneer

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:24.320
for for transformation in the education system for the global majority who'd come overseas

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:33.200
and he really you know going into that school um and it just being a block of um students who are

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:39.200
totally unaware i mean that's really shocking to me um but for him to turn that around so

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:48.000
so can you give us an idea of like how many pupils oh crumbs where'd you begin it would be in the

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:55.680
thousands it would be in the absolute thousands you know you could literally i mean it's dad

00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:05.600
retired in 1993 i meet people now taxi drivers for example or builders or guys working in hospitals

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:12.480
an accountant the other day um you know people who from all walks of life and have said to me

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:18.640
oh moon around we know that name um and i'm thinking they're thinking of my younger brother

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:25.600
who had a law firm in cardiff and they say no he was a teacher um how is he and then i break the

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:31.120
news that he passed away a long time ago oh and they say well do you know and they all have a

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:36.800
story to tell they all have a story to tell it's not as if they were some insignificant

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:43.120
those kids were never insignificant to him everyone was important as the next person

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:49.520
and i also get a sense that he has a huge personality and he was constantly engaging

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:54.480
with people i think you know looking back on it i used to cringe because you do cringe what your

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:59.840
parents do you do cringe what you know you don't want to be involved in their life you know you

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:04.240
dad's telling you oh i'm doing a function with the parade tonight and i'm thinking oh no i don't

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:11.120
want to be there i want to be out with my friends and um but yeah his personality was enormous and

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:16.560
i used to cringe because he he would project himself and i know why he was doing it there

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:21.840
was no one else doing it for him there was no one else saying oh ravi moonram is doing this down in

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:27.600
the parade he had confidence and he always had confidence though from a young man everyone you

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:34.320
know you speak to his i had the opportunity and good fortune to meet his best friend you know he

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:40.880
came over on holiday once and um manna and he was telling me about my dad and then i meet other

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:47.280
people from maritius who tell me about my dad as a young man and how he was a leader there's no doubt

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:53.760
about it he was a leader you know but a kind one it wasn't dictate he wasn't a dictator

00:32:53.920 --> 00:33:00.960
he was a leader you know he he actually brought people along with him and i think if i was to

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:08.800
sum him up in in a professional capacity i would say he was bigger than any job he took on bigger

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:16.320
than any job he never allowed himself to be defined by that task in that job he would always look

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:53.440
the owner's son to britain to experience some time with john windows williams because of their

00:33:53.440 --> 00:34:02.800
business relationship they sent over ht solanke harry solanke and he came over in summer of 1970

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:11.520
and uh my father had a phone call one summer's evening from john when john williams himself

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:21.120
john of john windows and he said oh can you help out i have this indian man here i don't know what

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:29.040
to do with him and it wasn't a racist thing he literally didn't know how to communicate with

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:35.040
harry harry didn't speak english so my dad went along next thing we know harry's with my dad and

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:41.760
he lived with us for three months while he was on his sabbatical with john windows at the end of it

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:49.200
he sent a letter of thanks to my dad he wrote regularly but that's his family in india and

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:57.760
when he heard of the miners strike in britain and how we were having blackouts in the early 70s

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:09.600
he air freighted food over to us from india air freighted fresh mangoes and yeah and my dad had

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:15.600
to go and collect it from the depot at e-throw right so he had to drive to e-throw to get this

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:24.960
crate of food and that wasn't the only example the managing directors of panasonic with whom my dad

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:32.400
was a matsushita electric in pentwind they heard about that when the miners strikes were on and how

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:37.920
things were supposedly difficult in britain for getting things they thought we were all on rations

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:47.200
they flew over fresh salmon to our house it was just unbelievable you know my dad wasn't into

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:54.480
taking gifts and all that sort of stuff an example of that is when the panasonic connection

00:35:55.280 --> 00:36:04.000
um vhs recorders had just come into being and um we still had a black and white television

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.760
though at home and when i heard my dad was doing work with the managing directors and that's a

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:16.320
shooter my little eyes lit up star trek in color i thought this is fantastic dad are they going to

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:22.160
give you a tv are they going to give you a tv well he came home one day and there was a tv

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:28.880
and a video recorder i thought this is it i'm in heaven vin and myself we sat there and we thought

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:34.400
we've actually got one a tv next thing i know my dad is carrying it out of the house

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:41.680
the tv the video it ended up in the parade he wouldn't take it personally as a gift

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:49.040
and that's where it ended up they they had the first pop-up video cassette recorders

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:59.200
there's something about the character of your father that is very altruistic very philanthropic

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:06.960
incredibly generous um a heart that strikes me as being as uh you know deep as an ocean

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:13.200
as wise to see um and of course he was doing all of these numerous jobs yeah so one would think

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:19.680
that he could afford his own television can you tell me oh the story of the television

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:24.720
i know it's going backwards i'm sorry about this but it is an important story

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:32.800
it's of when we arrived in britain my dad we arrived to our flat in in richard crescent

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:39.840
and it was winter was coming up and it was the big freeze winter and we'd heard tales we'd never

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:45.040
seen snow we'd never seen ice you know didn't know what it was going to be like so my dad went

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:49.120
around to a little electrical shop because there was no central heating in those flats in those

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:56.000
days we went around to a little electrical shop on salsbury road and it was just on the corner

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:03.440
see a blue shop a little tiny little blue shop and it was run by a gentleman called carl joseph

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:12.480
carlton joseph from jamaica and i walked into the shop and there was this big tall jamaican

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:20.400
man standing behind the counter carlton joseph and he looked down at me and smiled and my dad said

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.480
and he said to my dad how can i help you and my dad said i'd like an electric fire please

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:33.680
and my dad bought a one a two bar electric fire so we went he said and carl as he later became

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:40.000
uncle carl said to my dad what about a television you need a television you've got children haven't

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.360
you and he said my dad turned around and said you must be joking i'm a student i can't afford a

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:51.920
television he said don't you worry about that where do you live and my dad said no no no no

00:38:52.880 --> 00:39:00.160
anyway found out where we lived in richmond crescent and he turned up that evening with a

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:08.480
television set one he'd cobbled together and kept us in televisions free of charge you know they'd

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:13.920
be they'd break down you just phone uncle carl he'd come around and repair the television and

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:19.040
money was never exchanged hands occasionally my mum and dad would cook him a meal he'd come around

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:27.440
and we got to know his family really well over the years but kindness of strangers kindness of

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:35.280
strangers and that has stayed with me all my life that really kind people and then the reynolds

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:40.640
family down the road john reynolds and dorothy reynolds and hit their children pete and prashin

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:48.000
number 46 richmond road when my mum gave birth to vin she was she was working up until she gave birth

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:52.560
and then she thought oh my goodness what am i going to do you know we need to work to earn money

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:59.520
and um after staying at home for a little bit with vin she was talking to dorothy what am i going to

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:06.880
do i you know i can't afford nursery cover and all this dorothy said send the baby to me so vin for

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:14.000
the first six seven months of his life would go down to number 46 richmond road with dorothy and

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:20.400
my mum would go to work what is your kindness of strangers what did your mum work with oh

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:25.440
when she came here she was working she got jobs as clerks you know she's working in her first job

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:32.320
was a company called bell and nicholson in chichol way and basically wages clerk you know they have

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:38.160
lots of typing going on and ledger bookkeeping ledger keeping that sort of stuff things that

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:45.040
you know don't exist anymore because of advent of technology but uh yeah and then she worked

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:51.360
with she's had jobs in uh in the evening she was also working part-time in the evening because we

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:58.080
needed money she would work in the cigar factory on uh panarth road making cigars now i always

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:05.120
in vagi imagined people making cigars under a waterfall in brazil and rolling the leaves out

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:09.840
on their thighs but of course you know that doesn't happen no my mum used to work in the

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:16.560
cigar factory called uh mannequin the mannequin cigar factory freemans and uh she we used to go

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:23.040
and drop her off after after school her shift would start at six o'clock at night and uh this

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:28.480
is after doing the day job my dad would drop her off and at nine o'clock we'd go and pick her up

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:35.040
we'd go for the ride you know from roth to panarth road exotic pick mum up and

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:39.760
this was also whilst your father was teaching right yeah my father was teaching yeah yeah

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:46.080
so we we have a story of two parents who are working working day jobs and night jobs with

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:51.200
children yeah with children not only their children two others as well we had shake and my cousin

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:57.840
and his sister who was studying in college across the road cardiff institute which is gone now

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:04.320
um she was learning um she was trained to become a secretary and then she went back to mariches

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:10.000
but she studied here for three years and lived with us for three years and shake was living with

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:17.440
us and my my my dad never took money from the family to have you know he considered that an

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:23.600
insult if they paid him you know the attitude i think it's a very much an asian thing you know

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:33.680
um if we're cooking for one we can cook for two doesn't matter okay so just getting a sense of

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:40.800
the early your early life settling in cardiff and sounds like it was really um

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:48.720
hard work not for us not for the children but for your parents hard work for your parents yeah um

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:58.080
and i feel now maybe we can focus on what was happening in the parade okay um

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:06.160
um because i understand and i have experience being a ugandan refugee that we use the parade

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:12.400
for nothing and we were one of the communities that used the parade so i'm interested to know

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:20.880
a bit more about the parade who used the parade and what went on in the day yeah what communities

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:26.800
this is the photograph number 28 i have it here my dad standing outside and various people on the

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:33.680
steps of number 28 which is very distinctive it's the sea master it was the old sea master's house

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:41.200
that goes up up in the gallery upstairs it's a 360 degree viewing gallery in the top of number

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:47.520
28 the parade and that was i always thought that what an amazing the caretaker had an amazing place

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:54.400
to live in andy absolutely amazing place that was and he hardly used that room hardly used that

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:59.120
south glomorgan owned the building they still do or the council owned the building he was part of

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:04.960
the education department and my dad with his persuasive skills said oh well you know we need

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:11.040
a bigger place if we're going to teach adults as well because adult education was becoming a big

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:17.680
thing and i think cardiff realized that the director of education was very much on board with this

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:25.840
actually very much realized that adult education was an important aspect of integrating people

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:34.160
into life in britain and if you can't communicate with as an adult with your doctor or your pharmacist

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:43.440
or your work colleagues you see we didn't have huge asian populations in carlisle like lester

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:48.640
where they will support networks in place like parts of birmingham where people could stick to

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:54.080
mother tongue and get on quite well cardiff there has to be a certain amount of integration it's

00:44:54.080 --> 00:45:03.920
quite it was quite a small city and in that respect people had to get on and adapt to their new life

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:12.320
and uh yeah the communities that use the parade were as diverse as there are communities on this

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:21.680
planet so they're italians greeks um old somali communities from cardiff indian communities

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:31.840
bangladeshi pakistani communities all with their own little um customs that they wanted to keep

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:36.480
alive you know they were in a different place they didn't have places where they could meet

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:41.440
and if you look at the kenyan asian immigration to britain or ugandan asian

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:47.040
immigration to britain a lot of these people were kicked out with nothing that you know idy amin

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:55.920
was not very kind to the asian people that were made to leave um uganda and they forfeited a lot

00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:03.360
and testament to them that a lot of them grabbed their bootlaces and got on with it

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:10.800
they absolutely got on with it but can you tell me how the communities used the space

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:16.000
and was that outside was it a school as well in the daytime in like culturally as well as

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.520
their cultural events did that happen well there was teaching that was first and foremost the

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:28.880
centre for teaching english as a foreign language to people who say who for whom english was not a

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:34.960
first language so you had adults being taught there in the daytime adults being sent there from

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:40.800
various organizations adults realizing they needed to speak english to get on in the community

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:45.520
adults realizing they needed to speak english to get on with their neighbors you know and to be

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:52.880
able to have an effective life here and that used to go on in the daytime at the weekends you'd have

00:46:52.880 --> 00:47:00.160
saturday school where kids from mainstream schools around cardiff would come to the parade

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:06.800
and learn english or better their english and then it would extend into other subjects you know dad

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:12.960
was very partial to stick in his hand in with the mathematics and sciences he still loved his

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:18.240
sciences throughout life although he actually didn't get a chance to do anything with that

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:27.920
but the cultural side of it you should come along in the evenings in the evenings various groups

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:33.200
would put their names down and say on wednesday night the ismaili association would like to have

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:39.520
a function at the parade and quite often you know we'd find ourselves being invited to various

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:43.520
functions i say you don't want to get involved in your parents lives but sometimes you had to

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:50.240
because there were friends involved so you'd go along to various functions and you'd have the

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:54.960
Sikh community coming along and they'd have a function and i don't think there were weddings

00:47:54.960 --> 00:48:00.080
that took place there i don't think that ever happened but it was usually times of religious

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:06.880
festival someone would be celebrating something at easter you'd probably have the italians and

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:14.320
the greeks doing something and from that comes other people seeing you doing these things and

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:19.680
taking part some people would not want to they think oh well you keep it to yourself but there

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:25.280
was a lot of open mindedness as well a lot of people would want to know what's going on and a

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:32.400
great way in with asian people or historically has always been the food thing people always think

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:37.920
that's what associates people but you know you look at it now it's very trendy isn't it you watch

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:44.160
these chefy programs they're traveling around the world telling us how you know it's how food

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:50.000
integrates people but we've known that all our lives so i remember as a child in the 1970s being

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:56.320
part of that smite community and we used the parade for free for friday prayers and and

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:05.760
um and for big religious occasions and i also understand that the the puja community yeah

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:11.760
and the hindu community before they found spaces of their own used so i get an understanding that

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:20.160
the 28th parade was a place where all communities gravitated for help and for space and support

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:26.480
for nothing courtesy of your father right that's right that's right and quite often if they

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:32.160
you know he'd have a chat with some of the um so-called leaders of these groups who are

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:37.280
usually you know professional people or business people they understood how things work make a

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:44.160
contribution to this for the council or whatever you know or do this and i i've often heard people

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:50.400
they're saying oh muniram must be making a fortune out of this and nothing made me more angry than

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:56.720
to hear that because if you knew my dad money was the last thing of course he realized the the value

00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:03.760
of money to live but money to have money for the sake of it was never his thing and he certainly

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:09.360
wouldn't take money to for education no if you could just elaborate clarify that for me so what

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:17.120
i'm hearing is that um he he had a salary as a teacher yeah um but his extracurricular activities

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:22.800
well he wasn't people he did for nothing yeah when he when he ran the parade he became the community

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:32.080
education officer um and basically he was his task was to ensure the teaching of english as a second

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:39.200
language to children in south clamorgan schools so he was the county chief community education officer

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:46.320
so he would have to liaise with every school junior high grammar you name it in our area

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:52.560
so he knew all the headmasters and they had a fantastic working relationship with him

00:50:52.560 --> 00:51:00.560
fantastic rush there's a file here of thank of congratulations letters that have come from such

00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:06.000
a dive i didn't even know these existed you you focused my mind on this i didn't even know these

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.840
existed until i went into the garage to pull out these files that have been sat in a filing cabinet

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:19.760
for the past 30 years and these letters of thanks from every single organization you can imagine

00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:28.160
when dad had his award he was he was actually awarded an mbe for services to community relations

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:33.200
in 1981 and there's a letter from the prime minister the then prime minister margaret thatcher

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:38.560
of the day telling him he she has nominated him she's putting forward um to receive an award he

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:44.480
had to keep it quiet because this letter came out in november that he should be given an award in

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:52.800
the queen's honours list and she was making making a recommendation to the queen the for 1982 the new

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:58.480
year's honours list of 1982 for my dad to get this award we didn't even know anything about it until

00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:05.600
my dad came home with a newspaper on new year's eve and said look at this and there was a list

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:13.440
no picture it's just a name uh awards and new year's honours list published and his names there

00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:20.000
that's the first we heard typical of him absolutely typical other things that were typical of him

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:26.880
were um my mum and dad were invited to a party private party on board the royal yacht britannia

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:36.240
and uh the by the queen and they have my dad gets this series of invitations from and yet you

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:40.880
could you could tell it was something important the envelopes even the postman was hanging around

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:46.400
to see what it was you know he'd be on the doorstep you can open it master of the household you know

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:53.280
on the big buff coloured envelope for a few weeks these letters used to come and what they were

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:58.560
they were instructions about how you what you should do not tell anyone you're going to this

00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:04.480
party and they were vetting him for the next few weeks for security reasons you know they were

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:10.320
that he was vetted our car was vetted and all the rest of it but they went to this private party on

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:20.000
on board the royal yacht britannia and it was full of dignitaries and my dad now my dad that night

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:27.440
was gardening until six o'clock the reception was at 7 30 my dad was out in the garden gardening

00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:34.240
hadn't bought gone out to buy a suit a new suit hadn't gone out to hire one and my mum had been

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:40.560
dressed for three weeks she'd been prepared for this her hair all her friends were involved

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:46.880
someone bought an orchid for her for her hair the hairdresser vied came and did her hair insisted

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:52.160
on doing her hair but people in city road there was a different feel about city road in those days

00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:59.360
you know the the shops were different and we knew everyone and you'd go into the uh the delicatessen

00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:05.440
the greek people right you must drive past when you're going so literally they had to drive down

00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:12.720
city road before they went to join the royal yacht and uh anyway they got on board this yacht and uh

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:17.200
they were just being you know just in the corner keeping themselves to themselves

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:21.600
next thing that happens the queen's private secretary approached my dad approached my dad

00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:27.600
and said oh her majesty would like to speak to you sometime this evening anyway some time later

00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:33.680
he comes across said right she's ready so my dad goes and speaks to the queen with mum and they

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:40.800
were chatting and typical of my dad he does his research he does his research he spoke to her

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:47.840
about her commonwealth speech of 1977 the speech that she delivered in canada and delivered it in

00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:57.280
french and he commented on particular points of the speech to the queen apparently my mum said her

00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:02.960
face lit up and she said to my dad do you speak french i want from marisha's and they spoke in

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:10.640
french for about 10 or 15 minutes the queen and my dad spoke in french after that you couldn't get

00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:15.840
these other people off them well which country you representing you know who are you and the whole

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:25.760
rest of it and my dad said well i'm ravi muni ram of roth so very humble in all of his undertakings

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:35.600
yeah and so um there is a sense that because he was a pioneer in in education and community in

00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:40.240
in cardiff there was nothing no one was comparable nobody was doing what he was doing

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:48.560
and yet he was very humble about his undertakings can you tell me um did he ever share his inspiration

00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:57.600
or what drove him the ideas behind he could see we were having challenges racial challenges yeah he

00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:04.480
could see there was a he injustice was the core of whatever he did injustice and unfairness he just

00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:10.720
wanted the people to have the best opportunity they could i mean he he came he was born out of

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:18.000
that you see he had come through a system of colonialism where you know you weren't meant to

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:25.600
be in certain things if you weren't you know from the motherland you know you you as a as a

00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:31.600
colonized person you knew your place there was certain in in the civil service in marisha's at

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:38.560
the time there was only a certain level the indigenous indians could ever rise to and um

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:45.440
you know one interesting fact and probably for another day you know because it's too much to

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:54.000
talk about is um the seeds if i it wouldn't be too uh grandiose for me to say that the seeds of

00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:00.080
independence in marisha's were sown in my grandfather's house the prime minister

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:06.960
siwa sagurangulam used to come to my grant my mum remembers it as a girl having um siwa sagurangulam

00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:13.200
at their house as a young lawyer because he came to my grandfather's house who was an experienced

00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:20.880
lawyer as his mentor and the seeds for independence which was a peaceful bloodless independence

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:28.240
seeking a breakaway from colonial rule happened in 1967 and he became the first prime minister

00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:35.040
of marisha's and this then gives me an insight into your father's thinking because it seems he

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:40.560
was very progressive and ahead of his time and very much embodied inclusion every time i went

00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:45.200
into the parade there was everybody was welcome there was no other male female whatever your

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:49.520
religion even if you were right wing yeah you know even if you were left wing it made no

00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:55.040
difference he had teachers and would you say that marisha's offered a model a different way of

00:57:55.040 --> 00:58:00.640
thinking i think marisha's forms you as a person in terms of you know you perhaps you're a little

00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:06.080
bit naive you know i still think you know that people from the colonies are because you you have

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:13.040
this view of britain and you have this view of life you think everyone thinks like you you think

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:20.720
everyone is going to be as welcoming as you and then the stark reality of not being the case

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:30.720
you know hits home but with with that i think the bottom in all of this is that he was an absolute

00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:38.160
machine you know and absolutely determined to do the best he could for others to open doors like

00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:45.680
the mbe he took that but did he ever use it for himself no way it was to open doors because you

00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:50.640
put that after you and especially in the early 80s you have that after your name you get a piece

00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:57.040
of correspondence back people pay attention to what you're saying now he never used it to feather

00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:05.920
ravie moonram's nest or grow ravie moonram's empire he did it there we are let's push so and so into

00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:12.720
that role so would you say that he did it for the parade and all the people that came to the parade

00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:17.920
sorting out i think he did it for everyone that came across that door they didn't have to be

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:24.240
members of the parade but everyone you know the parade really extended to 36 richmond road that

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:29.280
was like a satellite of the parade because the bell never stopped ringing people would finish in

00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:35.440
the parade at 10 up doing their function at about half past nine ten o'clock at night they'd lock up

00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:41.200
then their meetings would go on and my dad would be home because he would eat his evening meal

00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:46.080
watching news at 10 every night that's when he got time to sit down have his evening meal

00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:51.840
he would come home you hear the key going here's footsteps come down the hall he'd pour himself a

00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:57.760
very small whiskey have that whilst his food was warming and sit down in the corner of the back

00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:04.880
room in richmond road and watch the news at 10 every night and then usually very soon after that

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:10.720
the bell would ring or the phone would say oh ravi we need to see you or ravi bye that was usually

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:16.000
the one ravi bye or bye yeah we need to see you now now now desperately so need to see you we've

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.600
got a problem with so and so in our community well we've got a problem with this problem with that

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:26.960
he'd never say no and then it'd be the signing of the warrants for the police the police would come

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:30.880
at three because we were the you know they weren't doing it because he happened to be a

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:36.960
bloody good magistrate or anything like that it's because we were probably the first house on the

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:41.680
way out from the police station so three o'clock in the morning he'd be signing warrants for the

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:46.080
police and he would take it very seriously they would have to explain why they wanted a warrant

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:51.680
it wasn't just a rubber stamp quite often i'd be up because i would hear the bell he was a magistrate

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:58.000
so they would have to get magistrate's signature to undertake a warrant to get a warrant to either

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.040
go and arrest someone or to carry out a search if they were suspicious that something was going on

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:08.880
but they would have to so that's why we always had a bible or other religious book in our front

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:13.920
room they would have to swear that they were going to you know things were being done properly it

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:18.000
wasn't just a case of going to ramming around his house and getting these things signed off it never

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.280
happened and that's why he had such a a good relationship with the police you know he was

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:31.280
very well respected within the police community so i've heard you mention quite a few roles so just

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:40.080
in sequence can we hear your father's title for the parade was community education officer

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:46.720
and then south glomorgan that was it south glomorgan and the parade there south glomorgan

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:52.640
were the parade you know that way it was it was run by south glomorgan it was a part of south

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:58.080
glomorgan education committee and and his other roles then because you mentioned the magistrate

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:03.120
criminal justice board right he worked under here's a picture here of him with

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:12.000
home secretary douglas heard now he was a tory home secretary and but you know didn't matter

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:20.720
he worked with there we are that's douglas heard standing there that's my dad with him

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:27.600
his last home secretary worked with was jack straw and there's a letter in this stuff

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:33.760
that i found the other day thanking dad for his work on the community relations council

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:38.640
and criminal justice board so he was on the criminal justice board the community relations

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:47.760
council the welsh refugee council council for racial equality equality also amongst a few you

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:56.560
know and we have these letters here of congratulations when he was given his gong by the queen

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:05.120
saying you know just congratulating him they come from they come from all sorts of organizations

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:13.200
you know across the board you know it's just but always with um always associated with

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:19.600
um the global majority and justice and community yeah always so that was his main

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:26.560
yeah i you know what i said earlier on about um he not being defined by the jobs all this was

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:36.320
extracurricular to his day job he did all these things above and beyond his normal job so really

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:41.840
we're talking about him wanting to improve the quality of life for people for people generally

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:49.040
and i think in particular it strikes me um people of the global majority who are marginalized yeah

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:55.920
yeah um and in precarious circumstances when they come to this country that may show the person like

01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:00.720
you know i remember many christmas days we're sitting down you know we have that just us the

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:06.560
family you know and shake and davina and their boys would come over perhaps my manchester lot

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:12.400
would come down and just a family thing in the house and quite often my dad would nip off somewhere

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:17.520
you know in the morning and next thing you know there's someone in town someone who was on their

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:23.120
own in this country you know someone who had no one or was feeling a bit down in the dumps i

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:28.880
remember remember it well you know every christmas there'd be say you know it used to get on my

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:34.720
brother's nerves i loved it i absolutely loved it but i know he used to wind my brothers up a bit

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:41.760
why can't we just do things with us for a change you know why can't it just be us but uh we know

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:45.600
we used to get on with it never used to complain to the person who was there they were always made

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:50.960
to feel welcome but do you feel your family suffered as a result of your father's philanthropic

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:58.000
crimes without well not suffered i didn't suffer um neither did my brothers we didn't suffer at all

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:04.720
we had immense freedom we didn't have the typical asian upbringing there were no expectations on us

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:09.760
to become lawyers doctors accountants it was none of that nonsense going on in the house you choose

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:15.120
what subjects you want to do you know it's as simple as that and you know if you want guidance

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:22.560
we weren't forced to i can never remember being forced to study or you must stay home and study

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:28.480
or you can't go to that disco or you can't see that girl it never happened it never happened or

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:35.280
you're not going out with them because they're not from our community it's never happened um but

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:41.040
certainly my mum had a tough time of it from the point of view we very rarely she very rarely had

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:48.800
holidays you know he was working flat out and the time he had holidays was when my brothers and

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:53.760
myself got a little bit older and we'd started earning some money and we actually went down to

01:05:53.760 --> 01:06:00.240
the travel agents travel agents what are they the guys that happened before online yes um went down

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:05.760
to the travel agents and uh booked a holiday for them and said right you're going and presenting

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:11.360
him with the tickets oh he would most put out with that why did you do that why you know i'm

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:18.160
i only need a few days away but once he's away he loved it can you tell us when that was yeah it

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:26.160
was in the 80s definitely in the 80s our last family holiday was 1976 our last family holiday

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:31.440
but vin myself and my mum and dad not even my older brother because 76 he'd gone to university

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:37.280
but my mum and dad that was our last one a family holiday and my dad actually took us to

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:45.440
paris we went on train you know we went we drove to dover and we went on the train

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:51.520
to paris had a few days in paris and we came back to london it was heatwave here it was stiflingly

01:06:51.520 --> 01:07:00.880
hot everywhere it was unbelievable you know it was so so hot so for somebody who is clearly such

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:08.960
a huge personality and an absolute powerhouse committed to selfless service i find it i'm curious

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:15.760
why there is no trace of ravim unaram if i was to google him or you know looking at any sort of

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:24.080
book around south wales or cardiff or educational pioneers can you comment on that in this message

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:30.560
you want to i would love to be able to comment on it and put some logic to it um but i think it's

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:40.240
for those who supposedly keep records of this city to look at themselves i have no idea why

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:48.160
such an important venue as the parade has been allowed to degenerate into what it has become

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:56.640
that no one seems to be concerned about that well a beautiful building full stop and secondly

01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:03.200
what it stood for particularly at a time when the world is fragmenting what that building stood for

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:10.640
what that building stood for it opened people's minds to other ways of life other people's

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:17.360
viewpoints and that there is no recognition you know the recognition thing he wouldn't have given

01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:22.960
a tuppence for it who are the people who recognize you anyway that that would have been his approach

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:29.120
he didn't care less about rewards he really didn't but i must say i i i can't believe there

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:36.960
is no record i mean you get um streets named after people who may have done some little thing

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:44.160
in cardiff or whatever you know and you think yeah well that's nice for them but there are

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:50.000
there are others in the city who have been sort of invisible i think of john reynolds former leader

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:56.480
of the council but coming back to your father as an what i would consider to be an innocent hero

01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:02.480
i know that he was a complete role model for me amongst many other things you know he's very

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:11.440
paternal towards me and actually enabled me to to view the world through a different lens

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:18.800
to view a world of through inclusion and equality which was very rare and in short supply in the

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:26.880
1970s 80s 90s and even more so now so for me um he really was a trailblazer and one of the most

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:34.400
important figures in my life on so many levels you can say so you're more than welcome um

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:41.840
and i think that perhaps your father's humility because he didn't actually

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:48.960
talk brag about what was happening at the parade i don't think people actually understood or have

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:55.120
any sort of record and he never kept records i understand of what went on well i think he did

01:09:55.120 --> 01:10:00.800
in in that it's here he kept the original documents of things i mean he very much kept the original

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:04.960
documents of things there's pure chance that i have the filing cabinet and the filing cabinet

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:10.800
literally moved from their old house in richmond road to here when my mum moved and no one's open

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:16.560
since today today is when i opened this filing cabinet and that would detail well it's coming

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:23.920
to going to the parade not only the parade but his university life his his job applications

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:29.920
after finishing university you know some of the most lowly jobs you can imagine that he should

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:37.200
have walked into not even getting an interview for you know it's just mindfully numbingly

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:44.560
numbingly unbelievable lab technicians jobs he would wipe the scientifically he could have wiped

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:49.680
the floor with them and there are letters of reference you know from his professor in cardiff

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:54.560
university when he finished his degree was finishing his degree he wanted him to stay on

01:10:54.560 --> 01:11:00.240
and do a phd my dad didn't know many he couldn't do it he said no and professor asbray head of

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:07.600
botany at cardiff university wrote an open letter and said this man basically to power in parenthesis

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:18.080
i would say this man needs to be funded he really needs find it some way of giving cardiff university

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:25.760
couldn't do it you know them being them and uh there was no one out there to do it and to ask

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:33.120
really bluntly then do you feel that um his identity his race was a big factor in this

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:37.680
it's it's he would never say that he would never say that and i'm not going to jump on that

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:44.240
i i i would imagine they had bearings on certain aspects of his life without a doubt i mean you'd

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:51.440
be naive to think it didn't without a doubt the way he was treated you know not just within not

01:11:51.440 --> 01:12:00.080
within not only within the indigenous population of cardiff but outside you know for example

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:06.480
he was working in the parade one night and um it's at the time when he was dealing with a lot of

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:14.800
iraqi and arab students coming in and this gentleman turned up and i think he was from

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:22.320
q8 and he was very smartly dressed and my dad was telling me and my dad was in the in the office and

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:28.800
he was wearing uh yeah what he's got on there you see that jacket and a jumper underneath so no tie

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:35.760
he's just as he is there very casual you know in that that outfit there and the man said to him

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:43.840
where's your boss and my dad being my dad said or just wait a minute um if you come in here and sit

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:50.960
down i'll go and get him for you so what he made him do he made him do you know the building in

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:55.520
28 parade is joined to cardiff high school field says a big basement that runs the length of the

01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:01.440
building so my dad took him down into the basement made him walk the length of the corridor we just

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:07.680
have to go up here go up the stairs the other way walk back the other way then sat him down in his

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:12.160
my dad's office sat him down he said if you just wait here a minute i'll go and get him for you

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:17.200
he let him stew in there for about 10 minutes and he walked in and sat on the other side of the

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:25.040
desk and he said right what can i do for you and this is typical of your father's sense of humor

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:30.640
very cheeky and i think this possibly went over so many people because he was he was he was very

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:38.080
light-hearted but but he was never a victim he he would go out and you could see his his rapport

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:43.920
with teachers in schools you know and you'd have that embarrassing moment when your dad's coming up

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:49.440
the drive you know because you don't want your dad's job to be where you go to school you know

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:54.720
he would often come to our wouldn't he to hoardian because we had our english as a second language

01:13:54.720 --> 01:14:00.480
department there and the teachers there they absolutely loved him they absolutely and he

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:07.120
would come to the school under the pretense of watching myself and my brother playing rugby

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:13.760
oh no no no he never actually saw me play rugby his back would be to the pitch and there's a group

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:19.760
of these fellow teachers on some touchline over there laughing and joking and you're thinking

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:27.120
dad's watching you play rugby right it was a social life with these other teachers you know

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:31.520
and this is what i mean about not negatively affecting your family life you didn't take that

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:39.520
oh no no no no no i i lived very much under the radar my older brother was pushing the boundaries

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:44.800
i let him get on with that because he was the first brother you know he he had the long hair and all

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:51.040
the rest of it and i let him take the flak i just did it quietly i used to sneak out late at night

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:56.640
you know very quietly my dad knew what was going on he said as new as as as long as i got home he

01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:01.840
didn't care he didn't mind i told him i always told him where i was going usually to the students

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:06.720
i was still in school but i was going to the student union to watch bands i started doing that

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:12.560
at the age of 15 you know i disappear at about half past nine ten o'clock at night go and watch

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:20.400
bands there and then roll home was it hard for your mom with your dad being away from home

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:28.720
yeah most of the day yeah i think she appreciates it now and later on in life but she feels robbed

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:34.640
she felt robbed at the time because normal people were doing things but you could never get my dad

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:39.760
to go out for a meal it would never happen you know it never happened if he went out for a meal

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:44.560
he would usually go know the people because usually it'd be other italian restaurant or

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:48.880
indian restaurant so he'd know the people running the restaurant they'd make a big fess of him and

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:55.680
he didn't want that and he always used to say you know we'd go out in an indian restaurant you know

01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:01.280
occasionally and we'd sit down and they'd come out oh mr mrem what do you want to eat anything you

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:06.240
want he said oh just get me a just grill me a piece of lamb nothing else no sauce on it just

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:10.480
grill me a piece of meat on there and i have a small whiskey that's it i don't want anything else

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:17.520
and he would sit there we'd have you know the full monte but he would never and you know trying to

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:23.440
arrange something you know to him to go out somewhere like my mum's birthday or his birthday

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:29.520
oh forget it his birthday but i do have a very lovely photograph of perhaps the last birthday

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:35.040
i think you really enjoyed was his 60th when we did a surprise party for him in the house

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:44.480
and it was good fun and the one before that was when the year before that we just had a

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:51.120
a thing in the garden just the family and he looked so relaxed you know jasmine is a baby

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:58.560
his granddaughter is a baby he's got her in his arms and it's just a perfect family moment and

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:04.480
if i think back to that day it's what i would call a perfect day that's what i would have called a

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:06.560
perfect day definitely

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:11.680
so just gonna say i had a little question if we just bring it slightly back to the then you speak

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:16.320
so much of your father's tolerance in your own life and his approach to parenting you do you think

01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:23.840
his approach to sort of working with communities and helping liaison lots of people and allowing

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:29.360
people to experience each other's cultures did you see an impact on that and attitudes changing do

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:34.480
you think the parade was really a place where i mean you spoke about the parade and the parade

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:39.120
a place where i mean you spoke about it yourself that it opened your eyes to those things

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:46.560
yes most definitely i'll give you a specific example of that you know there are too many

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:53.520
stories to talk about but there is a specific example in the early 80s as used to happen during

01:17:53.520 --> 01:18:00.320
our entire life train up we ended up with someone's child living with us you know a problem child

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:05.840
oh get my parents would get a phone call oh i can't manage this one can you um help out

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:13.680
and this was a phone call from q8 and the guy and the cape's father was working for a chemical

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:21.920
company it was iraqi by uh by birth but he was working for a park of lambert warner in ponte

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:27.840
pula chemical company and he said oh i can't he'd remarried and the son wasn't getting on

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:33.920
with the new mother you know was and he was of that difficult 13 14 age group so his father

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:38.880
decided that he'd met my dad some time ago and he said can you look after him for the summer

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:47.520
so this boy turned up the whole of the summer the first year he turned up um oh he just hated us

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:52.320
absolutely hated us the first few days of being here didn't want to be in our house didn't want

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:58.640
to be you know and my dad sort of as he used to do said oh can you take care of him you know

01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:06.160
one of you or you know help out so he became my responsibility anyway this boy had so many pent

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:12.320
up hatreds against various backgrounds of people it was incredible you know he'd grown up in iraq

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:19.840
they were now living in q8 and um he came over here and one example oh i can't stand jews you

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:24.960
know i'm when we were in marx and spencer and a lot of stuff in marx spencer was made in israel

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.880
and he would go in there i'm not buying this i'm not buying that so we thought oh where's this

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:36.720
hatred coming from so we took him to a party in uh one of vince friend's house dave kitchener

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:42.880
you know from school we took him to a party and we didn't tell him kich was jewish and we just left

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:49.280
him to it and we're walking away at the end of the night and he's our bill he's such a fantastic guy

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:55.760
that was his nickname bill was such a fantastic guy um marvelous you know so the next day we said

01:19:55.760 --> 01:20:04.880
to him do you know um he's jewish um perception changed same with korean people uh we went out

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:11.680
walking him my dad myself we aren't walking in the bracken beacons and he'd decided to leave all his

01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:16.880
rubbish up in the mountains so i saw it and but i said we're gonna walk on a bit and i'm gonna make

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:23.360
him come back so we walked on for about a mile and i said oh you left something behind when we

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:27.600
left the last place you better go and pick it up because look around there's no rubbish here

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:33.280
so he was having an argument with me on this mountain top i said one of two things is going

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:38.240
to happen either you're going to go back and get it or you're going to be down there on the other

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:46.000
side anyway he stormed off came back and he said i don't see why i should do this in my country

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:54.160
koreans do this so i thought oh interesting interesting so following week my dad introduced

01:20:54.160 --> 01:21:01.760
him to tong moon kim who was the martial arts instructor eight dan grandmaster he just went

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:08.800
he took him to the class just to let him see what was going on and he didn't tell him he's a korean

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:14.320
just said oh what do you think of this enraheed you know there's him doing all this amazing

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:19.120
martial arts stuff oh it's amazing amazing so at the end of it my dad said to him would you

01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:28.960
like to ask him to pick your rubbish up he's a korean but it is about perceptions and integration

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:35.760
and people breaking down barriers and people mixing those those exchange groups were fantastic

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:42.320
because you get people with a viewpoint you know their little view of say stuttgart or their little

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:49.280
view of nant they come over here they meet people with a view of kardif but they things change and

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:56.400
it does change people and i feel very sorry that we've personally i feel very sorry that we seem

01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:01.920
to have gone a little bit backwards in terms of all that integration that used to go on i think

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:08.240
you're interested that your father understood the power of dialogue and communication without doubt

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:15.360
so coming back to the community groups i know that the ismaili uganda ugandan asians used

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:22.480
the building and the prudhya committee i think they were their first iteration was at the

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:28.480
that's right yeah and that's still existing yes on isn't it the shrikachi diva patel samaj

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:33.120
they still using it they were using it until they had their center in grangetown

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:39.280
the india society rajagawals until they built the india center they all used to use i've got

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:47.120
photographs of your mum and rajagwal at an event in the in the parade you know they they're looking

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:52.080
at some material someone came in and was selling material and you know a good old asian woman can't

01:22:52.080 --> 01:23:01.280
afford a can't avoid a material sale so they all were and so there were also samali refugees that

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:07.360
used the parade in the 90s is that right yeah all sorts of refuge you know you had the vietnamese

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:15.680
refugees all and you know you look at the way the vietnamese community is integrated into cardiff

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:23.200
life and has done well for itself and it is that i think immigrants bring a new perspective on life

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:28.640
especially immigrants who've been through a tough time they've realized that you know they've got an

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:35.760
opportunity to make their lives turn their lives around and given the right tools and the right

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:43.840
conditions they will flourish they will flourish it's when they're met with bigotry and hatred and

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:51.760
all the rest of it you know immigration is such a good thing look at america if it's allowed to

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:55.520
happen properly immigration is a marvelous thing

01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:04.480
and i live what you're saying it's not just financially it's it's culturally what you learn

01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:12.240
from other people what you learn from other people and their ways of life you know the gentleness

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:18.880
that comes along with so i i always was amazed how gentle the japanese people were we used to meet a

01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:24.880
gentle civility to them to everything they did and some of the asian communities you know they

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:32.720
they have gentleness they weren't like us loud and brash they were nice people yeah i remember your

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:37.920
father recording a story of how the rastafarians used to use the basement in the 70s and but he

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:43.200
had to stop that because they were smoking weed and for the greater good he told them that they

01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:49.680
couldn't use it anymore because you know they were smoking the herb and that didn't go down

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:54.000
too well so i think your father well there was ruffled feathers i think he did ruffle feathers

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:59.200
in and out of communities absolutely there were some some communities who thought he was in it

01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:07.040
for himself i remember there was a community who some of whom attended my school who took a

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:13.760
delegation to the city hall to complain about him accusing him of favouritism towards other

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:20.880
communities and that's the last thing he would have done i mean there's a there's a shot somewhere

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:28.240
amongst all these photographs of him addressing a room full of people from and so-called community

01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:34.000
leaders self-professed community leaders of all backgrounds in this room basically knocking their

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:40.080
heads together and saying listen to you because they were supposed to be you know having this

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:44.320
meeting where they could thrash things out and talk about their differences and you know come

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:50.240
to agreement you know basically we're all batting you know we're all should be singing from the same

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:55.280
hymn sheet about development of kids and all the rest of it but now there were these little agendas

01:25:55.280 --> 01:26:01.520
going on and he basically tore them a new one that day and a lot of those people who are now

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:06.480
so a lot of whom are not around anymore but some of those guys for years afterwards talked about

01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:11.840
that night it literally was a sobering moment for them to be talked to like that and said

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:17.440
yeah we realize now what we need to do bringing them together

01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:24.320
but uh yeah he did ruffle feathers and i'm sure there were some people who thought

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:31.920
yeah uh he was having a go at uh because as i understood it weed was uh permissible into the

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:39.040
rastafarian communities as part of a religious ceremony but it couldn't happen in the parade

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:43.440
because the police would have been and for their good the police would have been on it like a ton

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:51.280
of bricks you know it wasn't as liberal as it is now and we're talking about ruffling feathers i

01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:56.720
think he must have done that in education as well oh without a doubt i mean he was a thorn in the

01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:03.360
side of authority and can you just unpack that please like why oh if i could i mean uh they were

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:09.280
telling me couldn't do something or that funding wasn't available he would fight tooth and nail

01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:15.440
to get that funding or to secure a place for that particular person in a school when they were told

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:20.000
oh they're not going to mainstream school you know they should be educated somewhere else

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:26.080
or some headmaster had resisted but usually he had excellent relations with the headmasters it

01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:32.240
was usually someone in the education office not at director level though because he always had a good

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:38.880
working relationship with the directors he cut through the crap he just yeah let's get this done

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:46.160
very much about that but he yeah he ruffled feathers he wasn't an establishment person at all

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:51.680
um he didn't attend the right dinners wasn't into it he preferred to be home

01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:58.720
very much preferred to be home and go socializing with the right people after work never happened

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:04.800
with his staff he loved his staff absolutely loved the people of the parade agnes keen margo

01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:12.800
mike adlington um you know little rick collett oh these people were priceless to him you know

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:20.880
absolutely priceless herb jan riot how can i i have photographs of herb jan teaching they're

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:29.600
in this group here absolute legend and of course let's just move to retirement because at that

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:36.480
point moment in retirement and if you could just confirm the date the um the parade was then handed

01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:42.400
over to a female muslim woman from outside of kardif can you tell me when that was that was

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:50.240
april 1993 yeah and that was the time your father retired yeah okay yeah he literally came home from

01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:58.240
work and he was ill from that day and i think what he did he fell on his sword he um he saw the

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:03.920
writing was on the wall funding wise and he took it very personally he'd seen the correspondence

01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:08.160
he was involved with the exchange of the correspondence so he sacrificed himself

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:14.080
he literally sacrificed himself he went in and said i'm retiring because he wanted to create

01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:20.640
opportunities for the people coming through i don't quite understand that he saw the funding

01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:27.440
problems and yeah well the uh the fun they were going to trim down on the staff in the parade

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:38.240
simple as question of numbers and he thought that um if he goes it opens opportunities he was 62

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:48.080
and but i think he he would have been happy at working without doubt but um what we tried to do

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:53.840
when he retired we we we were working towards this vinnum myself we created an office for him in

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:59.200
richmond road we thought oh you know you can do all this other stuff without the shackles of south

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:04.880
glomorgan on your back you know the stuff you know he loved being a jp magistrate loved sitting in

01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:12.720
the courts absolutely loved it again that was an opportunity to exercise life you know real life

01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:18.000
issues you know people coming across that call some of them you know not everyone's a sob story

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.840
if you can you deserve to go to prison you're going to go to prison or you deserve a custodial

01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:27.120
sentence you're going to get a custodial sentence but some people need a break and it's recognizing

01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:32.320
that and it's also about disseminating that to your fellow members on the bench you speak to

01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:40.480
people who we sat with on the bench you know for 30 years later they thought yeah he was good so

01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:46.880
another another word of his tools apart from being on the refuge he always says he always said though

01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:52.240
he recognized you know he worked in a time where the chair of the bench when he first came on it

01:30:52.240 --> 01:31:00.240
was a woman called hilda cohen jewish lady whose husband was um isaac cohen of leo abse and going

01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:06.560
cardiff's biggest at that time cardiff's bigger north of him and they were left wing good old

01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:12.400
jewish people you know who were right on and you know they were first generation after the war to

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:19.840
come to cardiff and did very well and but they were very liberal and open-minded and he worked

01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:25.440
with those people and some of it must have come off rubbed off on him you know have seen the way

01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:32.960
they operate as well he always spoke highly he was never kept it to himself he always spoke highly of

01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:39.440
people who influenced him in his life without a doubt never it wasn't all you know oh i invented

01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:44.240
this you know he always spoke highly of people who had a major impact on his life

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:53.120
going back to his early days you know it's people in in his youth who were big mentors to him

01:31:53.760 --> 01:32:03.760
i feel that we have only touched on your father's life um and what i think would be fitting is that

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:12.880
is there anything that you could put together in a short phrase or something that just sums up

01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:19.680
your experience of your father the parade and maybe what resilience means yeah oh

01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:26.160
crim's gonna be difficult this um well resilience that was that embodied everything about him

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:34.080
absolute resilience was uh being told you can't do something being told you know these it's

01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:38.160
against the odds do that well that's the worst thing you could have said to him he'll show you

01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:45.760
like how it can be done and never give up on someone never give up on someone you know he

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:54.640
would always try every avenue to make that person's life make them see that they can have a better life

01:32:55.360 --> 01:33:02.480
or improve their situation or do what they want to do and kindness there was always a kindness there

01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:10.960
always a kind person i think you know you you name it he was um kind to most people

01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:17.680
you know he had a smile on his face and you wouldn't see the bad in people first off

01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:24.160
always give them a chance always give everyone a chance and his ability to deal with people at

01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:33.280
any level really any level be it queen cardinal pope you name it he'd be able to have conversations

01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:42.560
with them that's been man me you know he'd be able to speak to anyone and you know show a genuine

01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:50.800
interest in their lives not patronizing not patronizing as an institution the parade was

01:33:51.280 --> 01:34:00.160
you talk to anyone from of that time about 28th parade they all knew what it meant you know people

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:06.240
from various communities or where's rapid is down in the parade oh yeah okay i'm going there they

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:11.040
knew what it was it was like but it was you know some people have a church and they know that's the

01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:19.120
center of their community that's their bond for various communities across cardiff the parade was

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:27.120
it absolutely it a fact a building which i walked past in the mornings on my way to work sometimes

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:33.040
like i'm in tears at it sometimes i've gone in there i've gone behind the metal harris fencing

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:38.400
and cleared the rubbish from the steps because it's depressing to see what it has become and

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:45.120
what is allowed to become and this is a time look what's happening in the world this is what we need

01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:54.160
