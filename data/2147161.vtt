00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So first things if you can tell us your name, where and when you were born.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:20.000
My name is Mahpul Akhter, I am from Pakistan, just straight from Faisalabad.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
When were you born? 1952.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Do you remember the area you grew up in?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I was born in the district of Attaqsing.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
How was your childhood?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It was very good.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You used to play on your own?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Yes.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
How many memories did you have?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I have some memories.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
She used to play outside, it was very safe.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
She had small friends.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
She went to school.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
She made friends during school.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
My friends were from the village.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
All the friends were from the village but they were all very nice.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
What was the household like?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We lived in a house.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
We were four sisters.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We lived together.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
We used to play together.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We were four sisters, two brothers, mom and dad.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
They had a lovely childhood, very playful, very happy.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
My father came here first.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Then my mother took me to look after the children.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So your mother was left there to look after the children?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Yes, she took care of us and sent us to school.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
She taught us all the things we didn't know.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Dad came here in 1959.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
They were all left with mother to care for.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Our mom sent them to school.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Also the Islamic education.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Mother had a lot of responsibility as they were growing up because dad was here.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
What type of activities did you do?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We played hide and seek.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
We used to play marbles.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
We used to play tippo.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
We used to play marbles.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I don't know what it's called.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
You know when you draw the square and then with the little thing you throw it.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I can't remember what it's called actually.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I don't know if it's hip hop or music.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
It is kind of.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
That's probably familiar to me as well.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
What did you say, marbles?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
We used to make marbles.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
They were not marbles.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
We had the five handmade stones.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
We had to pick them up nicely without putting them into five.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
We had to put them in one hand and if we don't then we are out.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
We used to play with the trees.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
We used to put them in our beds.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
There was another game I just reminded her of.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
In the villages they had big trees.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
We used to climb on the trees.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
She said they would climb on the trees and then they would get on the roof of their house.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Then they could walk over the roof of other people which was quite fun.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
When you are trying to climb on the tree, there may be three or four people and one person will catch you.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Whoever they catch they will be the one.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
It was quite fun.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
It was nice.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Yes, it was.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I used to play in my school.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
She loved sports.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
She used to play sports.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I used to go out to play.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I used to play netball.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
She used to go out of the city to play football.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
To present her team.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Not football, netball.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Sorry, netball.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
What cities did you travel and how old were you going to different places?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
When you went to different cities, where did you go to play?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
We went to Toba Tek Singh for the first time.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Then we went to Kamali.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Toba Tek Singh is a city now.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Kamali is another place.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
They were playing with different teams.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Different schools.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
So she was a teacher.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Yes, she was a teacher.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
My mother thought I was staying there.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
She was angry with me.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
She said I can't go to college.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
She said all the students who took part in sports, they stayed there.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
When she got home, mom was a bit cross.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
She said I couldn't travel back.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
It's not like from Kamali to Toba.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000
It's a bit of distance.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
She said I couldn't travel on my own.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
The teachers were there.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
I was very disappointed.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
We didn't have the technology to let the players come.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Dad was here.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Mom was the sole responsible of the girls and the two boys as well.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
It was quite a bit of hearts.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Like my grandmother actually.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
My younger sister was also there.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
She was not mine.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
She was worried that she might not be able to travel.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Younger sister went with her.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
She was the younger one in case she knew.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
What was your favourite?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Have you got a favourite memory?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
I had a childhood.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
I had a childhood.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
I had a school.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
School, yes.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I missed my school.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
I had friends at school.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And friends, yes.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Even if it's school, is there something that stands out?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Is it an event or a time or a celebration that stands out?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
I used to watch sports in school.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
There used to be a fancy dress show.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I don't remember if there was an event where people gathered in school.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
There were also clothes dramas.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Dramas, obviously.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
She used to take part in dramas.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Like school dramas.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
I was a bit scared.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
She played the postman role once in one of the dramas.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:16.000
So, after growing up, is there certain traditions that you would always celebrate as a family or in your community as well?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000
When I was growing up, there were celebrations that we would celebrate as a family.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
We would go to the parties that people would celebrate.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Yes, we would go to weddings and weddings.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
We would all be at home.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
We would go to the weddings and weddings.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
She said there was a wedding.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
She remembered.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
They used to do the fireworks at the wedding.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Any wedding happens, children.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
You don't know about it?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
I don't know.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
I lost my husband when I was married.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I'll tell you one thing.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
She said, a wedding is a very exciting time for children.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
The reason is because they were throwing the money when the bridegroom would come.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And she said, even in her own wedding, she went out to pick that money.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And I used to be told by my grandfather and my aunties, don't you dare, but we will escape.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
So that was the best time of childhood.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
It's not about the money.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
It's just fun.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Whoever can collect more money because they used to do coin at that time.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.000
At the end, she said, with other people, obviously other friends, they'll see who collected the more money.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
But surely when they go home, parents are not very happy.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And obviously the other thing she said, you know, Eid.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
She said, it's a special Islamic event.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
My aunt got angry and said, why did you go?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Yeah, especially on her own wedding when she sneaked out.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
So her other sister told her.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
She was young.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
This is when women were getting married at the age of 14, 15.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
You don't understand what's going on.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Are you allowed to go out and pick up those coins on your own wedding?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Because the bridegroom has come basically.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And sometimes they'll go to the mosque first.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And I think that's how the masjid is.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
And then they'll come home.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So it was a little bit different than what we do here.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
But very memorable time.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And then as you spoke about family and speaking about here, when, because it's your father, you said.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And he sort of gave me some advice.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Thank you.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
So you said your father came here. Did he come to the UK first?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
He came to your father's place.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And what made him decide to come to the UK?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
He said, he came here to work.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
She said people were called here to work.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
People from all over the world were called here to work and help Britain.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
So that's why her father came here.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And when did you come here then?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
When did you come here?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I think it was 1970.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Were you married?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
She did came in 1970 as far as she could remember.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
She got married and came here.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
That was going to be my next question.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So how old were you when you came to the UK?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And was it Wales that you came to first?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
I was born here.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Did you get married in the year of the Flink?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Did you get married in Pakistan?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Yes, I was 19 years old when I came here.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I was 19 years old when I had my first child.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
So you were born here.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Yes, I was young and I didn't live in Victoria.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
She had the religious ceremony when she was 14 and 15.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
But she was not given away because she was too young.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
So she got married.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000
When I say got married, she came to the country to stay with her husband when she was 19.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
And the first thing she was telling me, actually if you want to ask,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
what was her experience like, travel and all that?

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
You said that you travelled a long journey.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Yes.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
She mentioned it was very stressful.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
She said because at that time people used to get flights from Karachi,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
no flights from Islamabad or Lahore to UK.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
So she had to go to Lahore, then to Karachi.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000
But somehow the plane diverted back to Lahore and then back to Karachi.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And she had some other female kind of issue on the way.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And then it was quite hard for her first time.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Do you speak English a little?

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
No, not that much. I don't know much.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
You were on a flight from EIA?

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Yes, I was on a flight from EIA to Pakistan.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
I was sitting with my wife Hukka.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
She said, very strange.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
She said there were women who were older than her.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
She came here young and got married.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
But there were women like the pipe, Hukka we call it.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
So even there were women actually, middle-aged women who were coming here

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
because their husbands were here so they even had their pipes with them actually in the plane.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Which was quite strange for her to see.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And she did came to Newport EIA.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Yes, I believe you.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I was in the plane two or three times.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
She also mentioned that when the plane was diverted here and there,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
she was telling me earlier now, she said because she was starving

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and she was too frightened even to drink any water as well

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
because you've left your family behind.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And especially the journey wasn't very easy actually.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
So she didn't want to drink any water during her journey or have anything to eat.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
So it was quite difficult. Her journey was very difficult.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Which could be different as compared to any other people who came here.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
What was the most important thing that she had to leave behind?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
She said that the most important thing that she had to leave behind was

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
parents, brothers and sisters, family, loved ones.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000
She goes beautiful streets, roads, beautiful friends.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Have you still been able to visit as well?

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
You live in Pakistan, right?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Yes.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Yes, quite a few times.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And after your flight going back and forth, how did you feel when you actually arrived in India?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
When the flight wasn't good, but when you came here, how was it in Pakistan?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
When I came here, my brother took me to India.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
When I came out of the hotel, I saw flowers in the garden.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
I thought it was a garden.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
There were four flowers. I really liked flowers.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And today we were in a place, there were old flowers.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
We were in the middle of the road.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And I couldn't hear anything.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
I saw mountains and mountains.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
She said her brother went to pick her up from the airport.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
As she got out and he was driving towards Wales, she could see beautiful flowers.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Mountains. She said she loved gardens, she loves flowers.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:06.000
So she was quite amazed to see the environment basically full of flowers, big high mountains.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And what else do you remember about the first month or first weeks after you actually set in?

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
When you came here, it was a week or a month, I don't know how long it took.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
When it snowed, how was it when you left for the first time?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Yes, I came in July.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And then the next winter came?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Yes, the first winter came.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
I went out and went to the shop to buy some clothes.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
There was a shop on the corner.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
I had to buy some clothes from the English market.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
I had to buy some shoes or a brand.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
I had to buy some clothes from the English market.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
I went out and heard the sound of the car.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
I ran inside.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
I came inside and my father was also there.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
We lived there, and we came there for our visit.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
My brother was in charge of my father's house.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
I ran outside and I was like, I can't believe I'm going out in this cold.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Apart from that, when you came, I'll just tell you this, what she's mentioned.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
She said the one thing, she came in July, it was obviously summertime,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
but in the first Christmas she had, she got out, it was snowing,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
and she thought, is a wool probably coming down?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
So she rushed inside saying, where is this wool coming from?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And then obviously she was told it's the snow.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
It does look like it, very flaky and beautiful, and how it's coming from the sky.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And when you're very young and the first time you've seen snow.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:44.000
She said she will go to the shop.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
She also mentioned that she could say obviously sugar, what she needed,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:55.000
and she could understand a bit of English, but she did get more independent,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
basically going to the local shop.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
She stayed with her dad and brother.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:07.000
My sister-in-law, she's an English girl, and she helped me a lot.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
When she came here, her brother was married to an English woman,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
so she was living with them, obviously, because she was speaking probably English,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
teaching her English, which was a great help to Makbool.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
How did you settle down? How did you get along?

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.000
First I was staying at my father's house, so I was happy,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
then my father's house was in the area, so I went to my sister's house.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
She had her own room, so I spent a difficult time there.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
So you were with your husband?

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Yes, I was with my sister.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
No, not much.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
No, not much.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000
What she's saying is that when she lived with her dad, that was fine,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
and for some reason she has to leave her dad's house with her husband,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
and then she just moved with her sister, where she stayed for a little while,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
rented a room from her sister, her husband.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
So she had a bit of a difficult time settling there before.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
She had to tell her sister to get her own house,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
and she had to stay for a while.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Then she got her own house, which was much better.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Then obviously they stayed there.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
She managed some, but it was difficult, you know, when they had their own family and all that.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Then they had their own house and moved to, she and her husband moved to their own house,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
which was much better.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
And what about work as well?

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Were you working? Did you start working?

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
No, no, my husband didn't do anything.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
No, her husband obviously took financial responsibility.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.000
So she's just looking after the kids and all that.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Alongside the kids, did you have other friends, other community groups that you were connected with at that time?

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
She did say because the street where they moved to with her husband,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
there were people obviously, Asian or English?

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Yes, they were all reading letters.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
They were a woman who had come from Pakistan, but they were not educated.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
But then still she would just say hello to them.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
And she was very happy to see her husband.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
And she was very happy to see her husband.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
And she was very happy to see her husband.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
And she was very happy to see her husband.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
She was not educated, but then still she would just say hello to them.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
But not so friendly, but there was no other group.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:45.000
And she said she had a book which is like a dictionary basically, in English and Urdu actually.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
So if she has to go out and buy something, so she'll open the dictionary

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
and she'll read it basically, what she needs.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
So at least when she goes out, she can speak and she can ask whatever she needed.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Basically communicate.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000
And so what can you say that you miss most about your hometown or the country?

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
What have you missed the most?

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Nothing much. Everything.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Everything.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Even your parents?

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
I wanted to see my parents.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
And I wanted to buy them a pen and paper, but they missed it.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Because they were sick, they were very upset.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
She said that both of the parents have passed away.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
And then she said she's got a family there.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
So she goes there and spends some time with them.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.000
And she said the most painful thing is when we are here, if we lose a loved one,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
so then we are that distance actually that we can't be there with them.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
So that's the most painful.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000
But then the most thing they are missing probably, she's missing is the family.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
What about the culture as well?

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
What do you still love about your culture and what are you still connected with?

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:05.000
What do you still love about your culture and what are you still connected with?

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
And you are still doing it.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
What is your culture?

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
What we brought from Pakistan, you are still doing it.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
We are still doing it.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
And we are all together.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Even my sister's parents are here.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
And Anjit is here.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
And we are all talking about the pain.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
It's like celebration time, like Eid time.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000
And then we are getting together, talking about the past, sharing obviously the happy moment

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
and the sad moments with those who have come from abroad.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000
And you are sharing a lot of your time with the group.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Yes, I am happy to see that we are all together.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
And we can forget our pain.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
She said when we share things, like even coming to the group,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:58.000
we all share our stories, what we miss, or if there is any sadness, any grief, any bereavement,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
they get supported.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
And we all get supported, basically help each other to understand that it is hard at the time.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Because many people have said to me that if we miss a wedding, it's okay.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Life goes on.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Because people are still there.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
But when you lose your loved one, like when we come back, we are never sure when we go back,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.000
who will be there and who won't be there, or would we be there to go back.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
So that's the most kind of...

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
But people still go back to see whoever is there.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
We are sad when we miss our wedding.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Yes, we are sad when we miss it.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
But we have a community here, we have to support each other.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Obviously because they do share grief here in Newport.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Getting together, people from the community and the group obviously,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000
it's great for people to come and share their grief and happiness at the same time.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
In addition to some of the things that you just shared,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
are there other elements of the culture that you've made an effort to preserve?

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Like the wedding, the way we live, the way our children go to school,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:25.000
are there any elements that we have made an effort to preserve?

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
I think you have said everything that is in your culture.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
She came here when she was very young, very much loved in Pakistan,

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
coming here, having the family, bringing up the children.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000
You know that time went so quickly, and by the time having health conditions,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
and trying to preserve the culture,

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
I think that's the most important thing that we have to do.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
And I think that's the most important thing that we have to do.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
You know that time went so quickly, and by the time having health conditions,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
and trying to bring those cultures here,

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
like as she said, festivals, getting married, and all that.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
But she said sometimes it feels like I've left the best culture behind,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
can't do everything here actually.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000
There is a big difference in society, and the way the children are treated.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
We are still trying.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
All the children are educated, all the doctors are here.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
All of her children, she's done her duty, they are all kind of educated,

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
settled in employment, and she's got the granddaughters.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
My grandson is from China, he's a good architect.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
So she's very much happy about that actually, that her own children,

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
even her grandson is gone too, he's an architect, he did it, and he's working in Japan.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:06.000
So it's nice to have seen the next generation working hard and having good jobs.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Is that where Age of Life has come as well,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
and your involvement being part of Age of Life in support of that?

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000
I've been here for a long time, I've been living with my sister,

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
and then when I got married, I got married, and then my sister got lazy.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
So I'm very happy with the group.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
She probably knocked on the door and said, look, you need to come.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Because people do go obviously for pre-med, which is a cultural thing,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
and Islamic things to go if someone has passed away.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
So she encouraged her to come to the group, and she said she finds it very helpful,

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
especially when you're going through that pre-med process.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
It's very hard for women to speak about it, Islamic.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
We do obviously do Islamic rituals to give us peace of mind,

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
because sometimes you need people around them,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
and she found Age of Life very helpful, Jasmine and everybody else.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
But then recently she hasn't been very well, so she's missed.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
But she did her best, she does her best to come.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
She did, I think, Black History, the month they were trying to,

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
she came actually when we had the Black History celebration here.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Both of our daughters brought her in, and she stayed here with us,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
which was nice to see her actually, just glad to see her back.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Why do you say that that's important to have a group that can welcome you

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
and you can still go through those processes?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Because you feel that when you go to a group, it feels good to go there.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
You feel all the pain, all the tension in the family, you feel it.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Any worries, any tension at home.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
So when going to the group, you share other things, you respect,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
you look after each other, but they look after you as well, actually very caring, kind.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
So then you forget about, like for that time is her time.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
She forgets about what's happening in the house actually,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000
and then just be with other people and sharing different experiences.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:45.000
I think it comforts her, her heart is comfort.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:53.000
It's different as well, being in the house most of the days and hours.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Especially after losing your partner is very difficult for women.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Men cope different ways, but women are slightly different in our culture.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Because women think everything is gone with the husband,

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
even though having the children, grandchildren,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
still you feel that time you spent together, you could have shared those memories.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:21.000
So this is where she was saying coming to the group actually helps us to share those memories,

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
which she may not share with the family because she doesn't want to upset anyone.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000
They started crying actually because they were very close to dad,

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000
so she can't share that grief and those memories,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
but she'll come to the group and she can talk.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Because we have actually a couple of our members that lost their husbands,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
so I did found that the group has actually helped them to come out and comfort them.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:49.000
We can't bring the people back, but it's nice to know there's a place people can go and share grief.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000
That's everything. Thank you very much for sharing.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
I was just asking if there's anything else.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
She said she can't think of anything else.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
But definitely I think a lot of people are saying like childhood, my childhood,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
my story would never end.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000
I was saying tell him to do it in half an hour, and I forgot to tell him mine was probably one and a half.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
I said no, they will take just the most important things out of it.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
But I think one of the things people...

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:29.000
I think childhood is the best time of your life.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Which is true because you don't have any worries,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
and it was much more safe time in open environment.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
When you are in a town or a village, it's beautiful.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
People you can trust, they are not related.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
They used to be very close, which has kind of changed.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
If you go and eat whatever you want, you won't feel hungry.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
You can turn up at any door basically, they will feed you, and nobody will tell you off.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000
It was a nice time.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
I loved it a lot.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
Love and care for each other.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
I think it's because people have moved away from the villages actually.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Parents, grandparents passed away.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Their children grew up, they went out for jobs in cities.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
So it's not like as it used to be, but still it's nice.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
It's not like it used to be when we came back.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Our father used to come here with his elder brother.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
He used to have a big tree.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
All the women used to come there and sit.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
They used to enjoy it.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
The children used to say it's so beautiful.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
They all would sit around.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Sometimes you can visualize it.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
This was the childhood.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Everyone used to come here to play and their mothers used to talk to them.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Moms obviously would share their own skills and things, but the children can play with each other.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
It was a very safe environment as well.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Very friendly, safe.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
It's not like you are not related.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Anybody was welcome.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
When we were the head of the village, nobody respected us.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
When we used to go to the village, we would get food from the village.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
We would eat whatever we wanted.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.000
When we made chapatis in the Abhavan, that was quite close to our house.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000
So when people would come and they would run out of chapatis, someone would go there and bring more.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
This was the tradition.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Anybody who comes, they are not going to leave the house without having the food.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Which is a little bit different now because families have extended.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Her health is not very good, but it was very much open air, fresh air, love and care.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
That's a lot and the loved one being missed.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
There was no one outside the house.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
They used to sleep openly.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
We had a gate and we had the wall, but the walls were not very high.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.000
But still there was no fear that someone would be broken into or there would be something horrible.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
People would keep their door open and they could still sleep within their boundary.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:17.000
The open air, the beds, surely some people are still going and getting the metal pole or the wooden beautiful poles.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Traditional, traditional.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:28.000
She also mentioned actually that when she was in school, she knew very strange how sometimes you connect.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
She is my teacher.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000
She passed away.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
She was in Northamptom.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
She passed away and I was talking to her.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Where did you educate her?

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
She goes, Birbala Desert.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000
My aunt was teaching there.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
She said, rather than study, she was quite pretty as well.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
I said, I will look at her rather than study.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
I told her recently that she passed away.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
It's a very small world actually.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Sometimes you get to know people in the background.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000
When you ask them, even, well anyway, that's probably it.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
If you finish that.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000
I was just going to say something.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000
You can finish that.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
I'll just share something else.
