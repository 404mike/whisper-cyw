00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
We're not absolutely sure how my parents heard about the Kindertransport

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.560
because they weren't about, but we think that the Jewish community must have used

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.000
youngsters like Boy Scouts to go to the homes of families where they knew they were

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.640
children and explained to them that this opportunity existed. And we actually have

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:28.400
the application forms, two. One for me and shortly after that one for both my

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.160
sister and myself. You'll know that there were committees formed all over the country here,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.760
both Jewish ones and non-Jewish, to try and find places for these children to go

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.320
because the government had said they would accept 10,000 unaccompanied Jewish children.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:53.760
And so my parents were prepared to send us to this country convinced that they would be following.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.560
So we were given a place and we left on the 10th of January for England.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:11.680
Really, that's a very dramatic story. My parents, we were allowed one piece of luggage each

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.000
and they took us to the Western Railway Station in the evening, it was always in the evening.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.720
And they were very sensible, they said their goodbyes and were just about to leave.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.400
But I know that a lot of people were very upset and so we didn't snatch their children back,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.320
they just couldn't let them go. But we got into a compartment which was fairly full of children and

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.240
between us the older ones decided that the little ones would go on a luggage rack which was made of

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.560
netting, they would be more comfortable up there. So we put my little sister up there and she was

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.680
promptly sick, which was actually very helpful because the next half hour I was very busy and

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.000
my parents said look after your sister, we must go now and we'll follow you soon, bye bye and off

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:08.600
they went, which was very sensible. And indeed they did follow eventually. Now the journey started

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.760
off with rumours going down the train that soon when we got to the border the Nazis would come and

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.200
inspect our papers and our luggage if they found anything that we shouldn't have had, we might get

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.520
sent back or there might be trouble. And there weren't rumours, it was true. And the Manstown

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.800
number was a little out of about 11 whose father had given him the family gold watch,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:40.480
Fob watch and he got very panicky in case the Nazis found that. So he dropped it into the slit of a

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:48.400
ventilator and they didn't find it. We crossed the border having been examined and we all

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.240
breathed a big sigh of relief because it was very frightening. And of course from that moment onwards

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.520
he was fiddling around trying to get the watch out and never did. And I remember with all the

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.240
wisdom of my ten and a half years saying to him, look it's only a watch, your father will be very

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:13.760
happy that you survived, that he was most disgusted. I think the reason he had the watch was partly as a

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.320
family heirloom but partly his father would have thought maybe he can sell it and maybe live on.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:28.640
There are pictures also of children who came with a violin, again partly perhaps to sell, partly to make a nipping.
