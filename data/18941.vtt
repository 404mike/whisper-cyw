The traffic lights at the junction of Landmase Road and Clampton Major Bypass stand on the

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.960
spot where the gallows are said to have stood many, many moons ago. As Landmase Road was

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:25.040
always known as Gallows Way, the town hall was said to have been the courthouse, and

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.960
many miscreants were then sent to the gallows up the road. There is a certain amount of

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.520
difficulty with this story, as the manor courts that were held in the town hall never had

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.520
that responsibility of putting people to death. But it is a nice story.
