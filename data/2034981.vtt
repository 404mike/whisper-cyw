00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.480
Local bands have played Newport quite a lot with Budgie. Budgie are still recording music today.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:33.720
I've seen man in Newport in the in place. I've seen racing cars in the in place who later went

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:42.520
on to have a number one hit with their shoot horses, don't they? This became a hit around

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.880
the world. Deep Purple, what can I say about Deep Purple at the in place? It still helped.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:59.080
History speaks for itself. They weren't world renowned but they were still quite a top band

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:11.160
of their time in Britain. One thing that stuck out to me at a concert I seen in the Kensington

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:23.960
Club was an all female group called Fanny who performed topless and Suzy Quattro's sister

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:34.280
was a band member at the time. I even seen fans people at the Kensington Club and they used to

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:45.160
host all different music from heavy rock to rock and roll which a lot of teddy boys

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:55.160
would come to watch these old rock and roll bands. For fame you can look into the who

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:03.800
because the ox's uncle sung with Newport's male voice choir and he very often came

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:14.680
for visits in Newport. We have had many many local bands that didn't really make it big

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:23.720
but they had a big following at the time. One of the heroes of Newport people was a band called

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:35.160
Edgar Broaddon and we used to follow Edgar when he played around Wales. A memorable gig I watched

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:43.080
was in the memorial hall in Barrie and we were jumping up and down on the stage to get him to do

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.600
an encore.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.520
One time I went to the Ringland Club to see

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:04.040
musical performance, Mac and Katie Cassoon who the previous week was on the top of the pops

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.840
playing in a workman's club in Newport. This is what it was like.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:21.160
My mum told me stories where she seen Tom Jones and Lulu in the working man's club,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.960
the Ebbw Bridge Club, not mice glass.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:33.080
So this is how the diverse scene of music and how people came,

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:42.440
famous, non-famous, people who were going to become famous, played at Newport. Like I said

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:51.560
it was a very important place. It was a very nice place and time to live. I enjoyed my musical time

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:59.160
and I enjoyed my general life.
