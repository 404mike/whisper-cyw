00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
One, two, three, four, five.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It's all going.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's all going.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Cardiff Carnival 25th anniversary.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The location is Swicker office.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The interviewee is Griff Taylor.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And today's date is the 24th of September 2015.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Griff, would you be kind enough for the record to spell your name in full?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
My name, Griff Taylor.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
G-R-I-F-F.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Taylor T-A-Y-L-O-R.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Thanks, Griff.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Can you remember when you first made contact with Cardiff Carnival?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Well, it is now over 20 years and so my recollections are vague.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:01.000
However, I think I was involved with the setting up of Swicker, you know, called in those days, prior to going abroad for two and a half years.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The organisation, Steve, that you worked with prior to Swicker, what was it called?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Theatre Tannieson Wales.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
That's right.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
That was the one.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:22.000
That's where and which was about reinstating or comparing various myths with some Welsh myths from myths abroad and myths in Wales.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And I liked the idea.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It was cosmopolitan and suited my ethic.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Then Swicker was started up and I got involved with that.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And at which point, so soon after, I went away to the Solomon Islands with voluntary services overseas, otherwise known as VSO as a volunteer.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And I was there from 1990 to 1993.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:17.000
When I returned, it was just before a carnival event in Cardiff and I got involved with an organisation called Patwa Dance, which was a subcontract with Swicker to put on a part of the carnival event itself.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And at the time, I was dressed as a whale, as we were in Wales.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Whale in this occasion spelled W-H-A-L-E-S.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And we had on our heads, the whale tails, which were extremely heavy, especially when you were samba dancing around Cardiff.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
That's my first recollection.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Got it.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Lovely to have Patwa recalled.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I remember the Brazilian lady who came to Cardiff, choreographer, dance tutor, Fernanda Amarell from Brazil.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And of course, she set up her Brazilian community dance group.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And well, it's nice to capture her name in the history of Cardiff Carnival.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And you were there at the beginning.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So you've performed in the carnival, you've paraded, but one of the many contributions you've made to Cardiff Carnival is actually helping to document it.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Those who not merely listen to these audio interviews, but go to the archive can find, of course, many images.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Some of the best, I have to say, in the history of the Cardiff Carnival were captured by yourself.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000
What's it like trying to capture, yes, to frame, to make sense of all that, the maelstrom of images?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I mean, how did you go about it? How did you go about it?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Well, yes. What made you so successful as a carnival photographer?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Well, what you have to remember is that in the days that I was doing the photography, I was doing it on film, which meant you had 36 frames per film.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And so the shot ratio that is good ones to bad ones ought to be really good.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Otherwise, you're just wasting your time and your money.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000
So in these days with digital photography, of course, you can just delete and you don't lose the cash.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
But what it made me do is be extremely cautious.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And if I could get a high hit ratio, good shots to bad shots, then it was an improvement.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And what I used to do, what I realized was that in order to get good pictures, you had to develop a relationship with the person being photographed instantly.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I mean, obviously not absolutely instantly, but very quickly.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:55.000
So as you moved around the carnival procession itself, you would develop an empathy, a sort of a relationship with the people you're taking photographs of.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And if they had a good relationship with you, you got a good photograph.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
You had to frame it. That was it then.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Yeah, that makes total sense.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And clearly as a as a formula, it worked because I say some of your images have been amazing.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
But you supported Swicker and Cardiff Carnival in many different ways.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Like all volunteer groups, you know, were constituted and there were staff and there were project workers.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.000
But behind the scenes, there's a vitally important level of management and governance.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.000
The Board of Management and you've been on Swicker Carnival's Board of Management for a long time.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And indeed, what you get to do before we talk about that in particular, perhaps you, you know, for the record, care to list the other arts organizations that you've been able to to help in this way.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Because this kind of help is invaluable and really does help organizations to to thrive.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Yes. Well, Steve and I first met when I was introduced to the Board of Management of Cardiff Laboratory Theatre back in the 80s.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
I'm not sure exactly when.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And since then, I've been become involved not only with Swicker, but with also with photo gallery and more recently, Lanova Hall Trust.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And as it happens, the Steiner School in North Cardiff.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Now, I do these things. I'm able to do things partly because I retired a long time ago and I have the time to do it.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:47.000
But also, as many prospective retirees often feel, they're not sure what they're going to do in their lives after they stop working.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Well, what I've discovered is you don't stop working.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
It's amazing. You have more drama, if you like, in your life after you retire.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Calls on your time.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And calls, yes, but what you need. You really need it.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So from my point of view, I need Swicker as much as Swicker needs me because I need the the fascination of being involved.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
So that's for other people to learn from, I guess.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:28.000
So, but what I also would like to say is that my previous experience as before I retired was with the Civil Service working for the Welsh office over several decades.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:43.000
During which time I learned how to deal with problems or analyze them and articulate responses and and devise ways of solutions if we need them.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And which I found very useful when it comes to voluntary work with other organizations.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:00.000
So much so that I find that that advantage I have of being an ex civil servant is very superior quality to many people because they haven't had that earlier experience.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Yeah.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:11.000
I'm very grateful to say that Swicker Carnival owes much to its board members past, present and future.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And, yeah, for the record, I'd like to thank them all unilaterally, but specifically since we're talking to Griff Taylor in particular.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Of course, Griff was on board in the very early days of Swicker and Cardiff Carnival's had many different formats, different parade routes, different outcomes.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:43.000
You were there at what some people see the hailstene days as the mid 90s, when things really began to take off for the carnival.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:53.000
The carnival camp would have been at Cattays Community Center, and we would have finished on the steps of the National Museum of Wales.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Of course, give us some insight into what was it like from your perspective then? What was it like walking into Cattays Community Center?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Well, it was one of the best experiences of all really because I think the carnival is not just the walking around part of the procession.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.000
It's the process of making, which is for many of us and including me, one of the better parts of it.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:28.000
The painting, the making of costumes and the learning the dance techniques, steps.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
All of that is part of the process, which I thoroughly enjoyed.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And I recall going into Cattays Community Center when it would be packed, hardly room for another elbow with people painting faces and learning to do things and samba practices and so on.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And it was vital. It was just wonderful.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Can't say more than that really.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000
How about the end product having paraded through what was then the Civic Center?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Do you recall the outcome, some of the finale type shows on the steps of the National Museum?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
How were they in terms of spectacle?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Yes, well, as we spoke earlier, I was taking photographs often on that occasion.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
So I'd see the steps and see everything going on there.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And it really was spectacular.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
It was wonderful.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000
One of the, I do recall one of the problems which you had envisaged was getting rid of the crowds.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Once you stopped, what do you do?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So that I do remember Kathy Weatherup, who may well be another one of the.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
She has been interviewed. She's on the list.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
She's been interviewed.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Was able to get hold of the mic and explain to people how they should go home.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And it was starting to work. But she stood in there at a vital point.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:07.000
It's worth saying that those outcomes at the other steps of the National Museum of Wales would generate big family audiences who were entertained for,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
well, perhaps for at least an hour afterwards, there would be choreographed songs and dances.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And indeed, the themed card of carnivals would have their their name picked out in fireworks on the portico above the National Museum of Wales.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Something that you'd find hard to imagine happening now.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Of course, once and quite rightly to make the building accessible, once those beautiful steps, which were like different landings or stages for us,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:46.000
once, of course, they were broken up by, I think, four to six brass railings, then, of course, our stage disappeared.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
The museum became more accessible.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Unfortunately, for one night of the year, we lost our stages, which is a shame.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Yesterday, we heard from our principal funder, the Arts Council of Wales, that they intend that they will be withdrawing revenue funding.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
That's core support for the organisation from April onwards.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
I'm just wondering on an emotional level or whatever.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Yes. What's your reaction to that?

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Or where are we in Wales now with public and community celebration?

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
What's your sort of snapshot view on that?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Where are we going?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Or where are we?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Where are we? Yes.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
What's the future for coming together in large numbers and creating collectively?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:49.000
If SWCCA is unable to fund itself, there won't be a carnival, which means there won't be a process and there won't be workshops prior to it.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:13:01.000
The artists that were involved won't have an avenue to explore their talents, their artistic skills.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And the people of the community won't have an opportunity to get involved in the dance, in the procession, in the making.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:29.000
And so, as has happened in the past, there won't be an opportunity for people to discover their ability and their enjoyment, which can often become vocational.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And I know of dancers that have gone off to become professional dancers and artists that have become very successful professional artists.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
All of these things may die out. It will become more difficult at least.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Well, it's a crying shame to end on a somewhat downbeat note, but harsh realities often intervene, even in the wonderful world of SWCCA and carnival.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Can I just say for the record, Griff, it's been a pleasure talking.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Okay, good.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And I sincerely hope all good things to you and many thanks indeed.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Okay, thank you.
