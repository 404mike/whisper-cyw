How easy was it to make friends in school or college?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It wasn't so easy because of the bullying, because a lot of people kind of had their views on me that weren't quite the right views.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So they might think that I, you know, they knew I had a disability and they kind of took that to a higher level where it's really something I could help.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Because I was born with a disability that I have.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And it wasn't easy to sort of, even though I had a disability it wasn't a visual one so they couldn't see what it was.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But in here I knew what it was.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Because it's in my, yes, location in my brain.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But it wasn't so easy with the bullying as well because that kind of took away whatever ability I had to make friends because of the bullying.
