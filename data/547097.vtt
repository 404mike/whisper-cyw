00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I praise the Lord, triumphant, Who from the grave is risen, His fire and death so glorious,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Down in His church they call His, That we might all agree.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Hallelujah, hallelujah, Praising God, evermore!

00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And give me, Father, a blessing, A blessing like thy body, Like God, O Lord, with unfriending,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And let my heart be your feed, Hallelujah, hallelujah, Praising God, evermore!

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Hallelujah, hallelujah, Praising God, evermore!

00:01:44.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Hallelujah, hallelujah, Praising God, evermore!
