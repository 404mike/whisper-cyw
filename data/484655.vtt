00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:20.240

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.840
And do you remember what you were? No.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.520
Okay over the years do you know what costumes you've played?

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:48.000

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.560
So quite a few things. Do you know how old you were when you first started carnival?

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:15.920

It's just to join it and just have fun making and walking down the streets and stuff. It's

just fun to make stuff. And the costumes are they your ideas? Yeah sometimes. Yeah.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:05:01.360
So which ones have been your idea? My idea was for turtle. The clouds. The totem pole and masks.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:13.040
That's it. They sound like quite big costumes. Yeah. Were they heavy to wear? Yeah very heavy.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.560
They give you problems in the back. It really hurt. But it's fun when you got to the end though.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:26.480
It's good. So at the end of the parade were you very tired? Yes. And how did the crowd react

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.160
to your costumes? Smiling and clapping. Yeah.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:45.520
