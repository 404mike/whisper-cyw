00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Okay, thank you again for coming in today.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You're welcome.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Really looking forward to speaking to you.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So, my first question is, can you tell me about your experience of coming to Wales?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
When I came to Wales, it's not like the way it is now.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It is so scattered.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
There's not too much people.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And I felt it quite silent and ruinous.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We were not many where I was posted or where I was taken.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And now it's a bit easier for me to communicate with people for the last few years.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
There are some people coming from all over the world.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And I found it easier for me now to communicate and to interact with various people.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
But before, it was not good for me.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
When did you come to Wales?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I came to Wales in 2010.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I came from England, though I came to the UK in 2007.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And when I was in England, I got sick.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And I was admitted in the hospital for about four months.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And since I was an immigrant, I had to be brought here to Wales after getting better.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And when I came to Wales, I was placed in a hotel.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And the address of my illness, which was very serious because it was cancer,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I had to be kept in a hotel.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
But afterwards, I was considered that I was given a home somewhere in Wales.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And I felt, yeah, I'm safe now.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I can be admitted in my hospital appointment.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So basically, I came to Wales in 2011.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
But I landed in England when I came from my country in 2007.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Is there anything more about those journeys or times in your life that you'd like to share?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Yeah, it was not easy for me when I came to England.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Because when I landed, I went through a lot.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Until I was so much stressed.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I was a teacher back in my country.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And when I just decided to come to United, to just like to get away from what I was going through,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I came here and I felt it very hard because I was used to my family.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I left my first check.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
My first one was big enough to look after the young ones.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
But the last one was just nine years.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And I left her just like that because I was in a hurry to get away from what I was going through.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Within my life, it was just horrible.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So when I came here, it was too hard for me.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
As a teacher, you have started from nowhere in this country.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
You don't know anybody. You don't know where to start.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Nobody can recognize your qualifications.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So I had to start all over again.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And it was so, so hard for me.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And it took some years.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So that stress between 2000 and 2007, I was misused by so many people.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Come and work for me. I give you food.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Come and do this for me.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I will give you food like two years without knowing where to go.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Until 2009, when I got sick, I was admitted to the hospital.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.000
That is where I stayed for like four months after the operation, after a lot of things was going on.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And when I came from the hospital, I found myself in Wales because the immigration came in.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And I had no where to go.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So according to human rights, they had to take me nowhere to do with me.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And that is how I landed to Wales.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
I am a journey from England to Wales.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And I stayed there like some weeks.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
They were unable to hire me because of my disease.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
That is when I was given a house.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Yeah.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Thank you for sharing that.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Yeah, and when I was in the hospital, I was mistreated.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
I have the record. I forgot to carry that book.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
I was writing everything that was happening for the day.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I still have that notebook.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Everything is there according to what was going on during the day.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
There is a time when I was not given any food.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000
They could serve all the other patients and then me, I was left because I was the only one.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
There was a lot of racism.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So, yeah.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And when I came back to Wales, it was very like our Mureed.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
There are not so many people, but the hotel people were very friendly.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Yeah, in Wales, everybody smiles even though they will not speak to you.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000
If I saw my just smiling like that, I would like to look at you.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I thought it was a home, Wales, like my home.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Yeah.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
That's nice.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.000
You said that, you know, things have changed a bit since you came to Wales.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:03.000
In terms of your relationship with it, could you tell me a bit more about that, how things have changed and how your relationship with Wales has changed?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Yeah.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Compared from 2010, 2011, 2012, from 2013, let me say 2012,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Why I'm saying it's changing because I was back in my mind.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
I just want to go back to my get to be myself, a professional forever.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And although I was going to chemotherapy, everything here, I just thought that I want to be somebody.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And so I joined Courage at that is 2012.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I just was passing by as I saw it and I said that I miss my life back in my country.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
I miss I was in a college.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
I became a teacher. This is another college in Wales.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
So I need to start doing about it.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
So I just storm in in there.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And I told them, how do we, how can I join the whole, the FIA?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
How to go about it?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
How to start for the basic?

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
You have to start to do this or that.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
For non-speakers, I said it's all right.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
If at all I will be somebody.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
That is how I started interacting with the people.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
I found people with different opinions from this country, from all over.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I just started my life again.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
My life was so nice.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Now I'm in the classroom again.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Seeing somebody teaching me.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
I just started comparing my life with who I was the one who was teaching.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Now I'm the one who is somebody like a child.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
We started like being told that the heart is under the table.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Those are the things I was teaching young and young children of the environment.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
But I had to pass FIA.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
I had to take it.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
I had to respect what they are saying, what they are telling me.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Until they see that I'm beyond that.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Because I was telling the others, no.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Don't you see they go this, this and this.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
You can put them in one word and it's called the funchers.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Then the teachers, anyhow we are teaching and you are telling us more than what you are teaching.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
I told them, no.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Because I was a teacher, they told me you don't belong here.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
So they advised me to go to the next level.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
But I couldn't.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
So what I thought they did, they told me.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Can you do diploma in business?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
I told them yes.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
So I did the diploma in business.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Which was all out of what I know.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Because it's not my career.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I just do it.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And I passed in 2012 and 2013.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And that is how my life started.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Yeah.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Yeah.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And from there, about a few months, I was removed from house to house, house to house.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Then I had to bring my two children who were adult.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And they came and joined me.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:24.000
After that, regardless of my condition, because the cancer was too much for me.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
And then it had spread to the tummy.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
They had to put a condition.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So I have a condition.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I have a stomach bug, which I'm managing up to now.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And to the heart of that, I thought that I just want to go to school again.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And that's when I applied for university.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And still I could not be a teacher.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
I felt that it's too much for me.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
So I told them I just want to do something to do with the community.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Something whereby mix with the community.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
I need to, because I was a special need teacher back in my country.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
I want to do some things to do with vulnerable people.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
That is when I was offered to do health and social care management.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
I did my first degree.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
I passed very well.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And to come outside is not the way I expected.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
There's no job like that.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
So I had to do care jobs, support workers.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Although I felt it's okay, because in my church, I was helping those old children, old women.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:42.000
I could go to their cups, sit down, start eating with them, give them company, chatting.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And I felt that I'm doing something to the community.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And the student, the support worker.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Then that is how I started mixing, seeing life have changed.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Then all of a sudden, my mind again told me, I knew you were a teacher.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
I felt that, yes, I was a teacher.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
They told me you can't do the classroom setting unless you do masters in something.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
They asked me, which area are you in Kenya?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
I told them I was dealing with children with autism.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:20.000
I was offered a place again to do the masters in additional needs.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
I did my one year masters and I passed.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
I started volunteering in a classroom setting.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Then I felt it is not what I wanted.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
I left it.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:41.000
I started working with the community as a support worker.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Sometimes care.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Yes, that is my life here now.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Then I got this one, the project.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.000
That is how I found that we have changed because I'm doing this, I'm mixing with people.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
I am giving to the community.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Before I was like fraught when I gained nothing.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
But when I first started with courage, I mixed with people.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
We talked, I gained years, I gained years, I gained years.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And now I build that myself.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Now I am in a level where I am not afraid of anybody.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
I can approach anybody.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
I am given a chance to approach people.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Because things have changed.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Yes.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Good story.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Thank you.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Would you be able to tell me a bit about what home means to you now?

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
My home.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Although there is upside down.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Because not because I'm not somebody with a system, economic, everything, which is affecting everybody.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
To call a home again is not a home to me.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Because back in my country, a home meant that I could go to my garden, pick some food, milk my cows, have my own fresh things.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:30.000
But nowadays I study in my house and see it's not anymore like the way it was.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Even it achieved from how I came in this country.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
It's a bit hard.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And now as a single mom, bringing the two young adults is not easy.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Because in my country, although it has not achieved, you could say stop and they can stop.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Nowadays as a single mom, if you tell them to stop, they have their right to do what they want.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:04.000
So when you are at home, you don't know how you react, how they react because of the system in here.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:11.000
So it's a home, but on the other side you have to put the boundaries to call it a home.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
You have to use your own techniques.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
How old are you, Jody?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
One is 20.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
The only girl is 25.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And the boy is 29 now.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
But I have two more back in Africa.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
One is 39, the other one is 35.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Yeah, big family.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
It's a big family.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And I had it called too because some are here, some are not.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
How often do you go back at all?

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
The first time we went was about 12.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000
After 12 years in this country, I went in two years ago to see them.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And then I came back.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And then I lost two of my sisters.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
I had to go back.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And yeah, and just recently I lost another one here, my sister.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
So yeah.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
I'm sorry.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Thank you for sharing all of that really generously.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:33.000
I wonder, can you tell me a bit about a place or a time in your life that is important to you?

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
It's when my children join me when I was sick.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
And I was waiting for another operation.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
I've gone like five operations.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
And that one was so hard.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
They came in.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And after two months, I was told I will have another major operation.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
So my daughter was 14 by then.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
But she was there for me.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
My son was there for me.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Comparing with previous when I came here, I had nobody.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
I knew nobody.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
I stayed in the hospital, depending on the hospital food, depending on whoever will spread the mercy.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
There is someone who is from this country.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
But my children came in.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.000
My first operation was at least, even if I lose my life, my children are here with me.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
So that operation I was told it can be 50-50.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
And it was true.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And so when it was done, it started to add wheel out.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
I became very sick.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
And I remember my daughter with me.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000
They had to find a way of hiding her because they didn't expect what they saw.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
So they just get away from this food somewhere.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
And I was told that I will go another emergency.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
After three days, I was told I will go another major emergency.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
They had the first man's tumor, but it didn't work.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
So they told me we have to take him back to the hospital and put the man's tumor back.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Because it's not working.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
And you are getting worse.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
So I was told inform your family.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
But don't tell your daughter because it will not be easier.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
It is 50-50.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
We don't know whether we will succeed.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:42.000
But when I was operated, when I was operated, when I wake up, I found myself back with the bath.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
I was like, what is happening to me?

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Nothing is working for you.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
But now this will be permanent.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
We don't need to risk again.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
And I told them, yeah, I'm happy.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
It saved my life.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000
I'm happy.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
I'm happy.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
My family is here.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
I can tell them and they can pass the nursing before.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
If I die, there's some people to send the nursing.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:20.000
The most important, why I'm saying this, that one was Muslim or happiest day or something which made me happy.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Because my family was there when I needed them.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Yeah.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Thank you for sharing that.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Okay.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Thank you.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Is there anything else you want to tell me about that time in your life?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
I don't think there's anything else.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Yeah.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:46.000
I wonder if you would like to tell me about your childhood or growing up in Kenya.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Okay.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:57.000
All I can remember, I was born in 1965.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:04.000
And we are family of ten, seven girls, three boys.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
But now all have gone.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:14.000
We are left with two of us, the girls, and two boys.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
So we are three girls and two boys now.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:32.000
And I grew up in a village whereby we would do a lot of work fetching water, fetching firewood, a village life.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:43.000
And I grew up with my siblings, the one who I lost last year.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
I was not, we are seven.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
I'm the third from the last.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
I'm the fourth from the last.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Soon I have lost two other me.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
And I lost two.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
So five of them have gone.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
So four of them have gone.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
So yeah, I went to school back in 1974.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
I went to primary school.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
We could carry them.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
My mother was a business woman.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:23.000
And we could take the bananas, you know, bananas.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000
So before we go to school, we had to take the bananas to the town city center.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
All of us, each with one, each with one, leave them there.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:41.000
And my mom, because she was having a problem with her legs, she could go and sell during the day.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.000
So we had to, we are taking every day and go to school.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Then in the evening we could fetch firewood, we could fetch water.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:01.000
And it was a happy life because it's you and your children and you're sharing everything.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Like the way I remember when we were in a museum and somebody talked about sitting in the waterfront.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
There's somebody who said about sitting.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
We were talking, we were discussing sitting down.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
And if you were sitting improperly, your mom could throw something to you.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
You knew that it was fun and everything.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
And our parents were communicating by hitting you.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Not like now.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
So I finished my primary school that way.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
The secondary school I went to, unfortunately I went to a day school.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:47.000
I had to do the same thing, helping my mom to take some stuff to the market, going back to school, coming in the evening.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
The worker is waiting for you, fetching firewood.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:00.000
If there is anything to do, fetching water, doing all sorts of things, then you sleep the same thing, getting this yourself.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Then after that, after my secondary school, I just do some like kashiwaka before I get married.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
I got married and I got my children.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:25.000
And I get married whereby it's not that it was yet time, but because others are doing that, my age meeting, I get married.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
I got married that day.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
And it's not a first marriage.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
It's just for me, just because my friend is doing it.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Nobody to, yeah.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
So nobody forced me to do it.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
So I got my four children.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000
And after that, that is how the life started.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Although I went through the college, through as a teacher, my career, I went through a lot.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
But the thing is, I could not go back to my parents.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Whenever I go back to my parents, I was told, you have to go back.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Marriage was very respected by them.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Your parents, you stay two, three days to tell you have to go back.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
They come, they will see you have to go back.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Every time you go, you have to go back.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Until I found that enough is enough.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
I have to take my children.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Maybe they will join me later.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Maybe somebody will take care of them.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
I left them and I made my decision to come to the UK.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
So that is how my life was.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
A bit of the beat of my life.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Yeah.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Thank you for sharing all of that.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:47.000
I wonder if you could tell me about a, you have told me about one important moment with your children coming to be with you.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Is there another maybe a magic moment when something changed for you?

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
I don't know.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Here in the UK?

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
That can be, it can also be previously.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
It can be any time in your life.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Just something that felt magic, that felt something was changing.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Yeah.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:22.000
To me, let me say, as I said before, I had no voice.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:30.000
But after mixing with people, after talking with people, like here in Bowser, it gave me more confidence.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
When I started this project, this is my first project.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
I started it like very low.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000
I didn't know what to do.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Sometimes I was like, where am I?

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000
What is this?

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Although I had been doing a lot of projects during my courses and during my whatever, it's not like this one.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
This is my first one to work for it for money.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:00.000
So, but there is a time I can say that I feel that I have the confidence to speak.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
I have a confidence to say, no, I can't do it.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:11.000
I have a confidence to say this, I'm doing the project to tell some people when I say that it's succeeding,

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
it's that I'm getting what is going on.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Now I have the courage to tell people I'm doing a project.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:25.000
And I told some people, some people try to, if you go to Bowser or Google, see their jobs, if it's something to do the project, pick it.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
It's not a big, big, big thing.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
It's something you can do it.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.000
And that moment make me feel that I'm somebody I can talk.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
I feel even now, that is why I'm talking to you in a corner.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000
And before I was like, no, but now I can face anybody.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
I can talk to any group.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Before I was tiptoeing to come to Bowser, now I open the door.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
It's my right to be open the door for me.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
I'm doing something, you see.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
This is some of the magic.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
This is like a magic to me.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
And I can face another one and another project.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
And I feel that I had told people apply, some applied and got the jobs.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Yeah, not in the project, but in some failures.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Because they are seeing this, it's not something they can be able to do.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
I'm telling them, don't sit there.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Go, try, they will help you.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
It's like magic to me.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
It's like a magic.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
That's amazing.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
That's fantastic.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
That does really sound magical.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Yeah.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Okay.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Could you tell me about your hopes for the future?

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
What are your hopes for the future?

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
One, I have no permanent job.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
It's something I was doing on a piece of paper last night in my house.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
I was like, where am I heading?

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:09.000
So in future, unless I volunteer, I don't feel like I can do any stressful job.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
I just want to do like volunteering things.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:20.000
If I don't get something for myself, I think I have done enough.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
In my country, I worked for 18 years as a teacher.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
I have so much in my head with the children.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Here I'm working with the grown-up, vulnerable people.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Sometimes too much for me, but I feel I'm passionate about it.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
I feel I have to do it.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:48.000
But in future, I just want to have something just for me,

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:56.000
but to do with vulnerable people, but not somebody and offer me to tell them that it's a deadline.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
There is a deadline.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:06.000
There I need my peace of life and something I can do with two or three people.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
If at all I don't get the council to give me just three vulnerable people,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:20.000
old, either old or those with disabilities, and sit with them in their houses, house accommodation.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Sit with them.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Do paperwork for them.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Me, myself, send it to the council, say this one, do the care plan, everything, assessment.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
In future, it will be something like that.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:43.000
If it will not work, I give it to somebody else, but I know I have something which is going on.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Is it that you'd like to have your own organization or company?

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
It's a company.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
It's like a company.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Just for accommodation, accommodated living, supported living.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Wherever I get in, find them, they are here.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
We talk, they want to go somewhere, that sort of things.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Or a house with just three old women, you know, and some people who would like to be, just to sit with them.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
We meet, we talk, we do the various things.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Word, pencil, everything, things like that.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
So you'd like to support them in their accommodation?

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Yeah.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Sounds great.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Yeah, that is it.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
In future, not in future, that's why I say that.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
My time is like, happy now.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
So it's something which I'm thinking of now.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
You said you want like your peace of life, you know, peaceful times.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Is there anything else that helps you to feel at peace that you enjoy doing?

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
How does you feel peaceful?

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Gardening.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
In my house, I plant my own vegetables.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
That's most of the time in my compound.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
Then from there, I either walk and wait for...

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
I walk and I like walking.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
In the bushes, I hear the birds sound, those things.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
But I don't like mixing with so many people.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
For one reason is the coordination.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.000
My coordination, if I sit for a long time with the people in a group, I have to tell them,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
if you hear my sound, my tummy making, this, that, I have the coordination.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000
I don't want that.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
So that's why I say that.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Just one or two or three, we may tell them, I have this.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000
If you hear something, it's my stomach.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
But a logical is very hard to explain.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Yeah.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Yeah.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Yeah.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Yeah.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Sounds like a great idea for the future.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Yeah.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000
So is there anything else you'd like to tell me or share that you feel is important for

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
people to know about you and your life?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Anything important.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000
Yeah.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Is there anything else that you'd like to tell us about your life that you think is

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:25.000
important for people to know, to have on this record of your life?

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Is there anything else you'd like to tell us?

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:36.000
To take each other at a time.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
People should not, that's me.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
I always say that.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Take that day you are there.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
You either do something for yourself or for the people.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
If you don't do something for yourself, do it for the people.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:01.000
And that's something which will be remembered in future and say, yes, Annie did this for

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000
us.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
And if you feel there is something which is inside, you take it out.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Let people know.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000
And yeah, that is it.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
That's beautiful.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Thank you.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
So that's it for the questions for the interview.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000
I thought now we could just go over the museum visits again.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:29.000
And if you wanted to tell any of those stories again or add anything, you know, what are

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000
the things you saw?

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
What are the memories you had?

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
I'd love to just make sure we've got that properly on the audio.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000
When we are visiting the museum for the first time at Waterfront, you know, I was saying

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000
that like I am going there to take the women to see the museum.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:54.000
Then when we went there, I was like, oh, so even me, there is some things I'm learning

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
from there.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000
I started to get the interest of the museum.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
What is there?

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
What is happening?

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:10.000
And when the lady started telling about the things, I became more and more interested.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000
The first thing which caught my eyes is the typewriter.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:24.000
When I saw that typewriter, it gave me a memory back in my ears when I finished secondary

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000
school.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:33.000
And I remember when I finished my secondary school, the first thing I told my parents

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000
that I want to be a secretary.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Then I went to a college called Peteyman in Nairobi.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
I went there and I was enrolled.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:52.000
And when I saw that computer, I remember the ones we are using, they were using some ink

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
long, long time ago.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:00.000
That is about 20 or 30, that is about 45 years ago.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000
They were using the ink.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
And that gave me a nice memory.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
I was going to Nairobi Street.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
Nairobi is the capital city of Kenya.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:19.000
The way I was going to the street, just to type, it was making some noise.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
All your type in here.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
That gave me a very nice memory.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.000
And I was like, so I can then see something like this here in the UK.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:36.000
And I remember asking you whether this is the same Peteyman, whether it's the same in

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
my country, Nairobi.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000
And you give me the feedback and you told me it's the same.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:50.000
And that thing has made me proud that I started 45 years ago and now I can see it somewhere.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000
In Kenya, they were disposing of it.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000
You can't get them.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
You won't see them anywhere.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
But I was happy to see that one.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
That is the Waterfront Museum.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Can you tell me a bit more about how it felt to type on it?

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
What did it feel like?

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Just wait for this noise to stop now.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Gosh, it's very noisy here today, isn't it?

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
A ton of noise.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:26.000
The one which was here, all the way I was doing it back then.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
The one you could remember?

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Yeah.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:37.000
It was nice because even when you are in a very, very low mood, you know it was making

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
very, I have told you it was making that noise.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
That, that, that, that.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.000
You know, it's like giving you some, even if you come home and you feel that, when you

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
come home to the college and you feel that you cannot do it, the way everybody was doing

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
it is you are making fun of each other.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
It's like a keyboard, you know?

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000
And so that gave me a memory of the happiness, gave you back your sense, gave you back your

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000
happiness.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Yeah, it was nice.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:13.000
And that is why when I saw it here I felt that, yeah, it's something which can give

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:19.000
me the memories of my country and my childhood, not childhood really, that youthiness.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Yeah.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Yeah, that you'd be feeling youthful?

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000
Yeah.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Yeah.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
That's great.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
What else did you see that sparked memories for you?

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Yeah, waterfront.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Waterfront museum in Soansea.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
There is also a locomotive.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Yeah.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
It was there, isn't it?

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Yeah.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
And we are told that you are using the solar.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:54.000
Then I remember I asked them what happens if they, like in our house, back in Kenya,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:00.000
if we put the solar and there is no light, I mean there is no sun, we are in darkness,

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:06.000
although it's not fully darkness, you cannot see enough light because they are using the

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
solar with the sunlight they see.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000
And I was thinking about it because they say that it was, you can go and Google about it

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000
that in the, that Soansea, it is here, but I can't do it.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
It is in my phone.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Yeah.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000
This one.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000
Ah, yeah.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000
Yeah.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Yeah, you see?

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Yeah.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000
So did you have solar in Kenya?

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
For the houses, for the light.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Yeah.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Yeah.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Before there was electricity, we are using solar.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Then I was thinking about this thing.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:50.000
If it was using solar to go all the way, what about if there is a, like I was asking if

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.000
it is like the one we are using in Kenya and there is no sun that day, so we are using

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
the light firewood to see through.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
What about this one?

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000
If it's on the way and it stops, what will happen?

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Will it be the end of the journey?

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000
I don't know.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
So I need something to know more about it.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Unfortunately, I didn't get in, but tell me what will happen.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:21.000
But then this is like, I just compared to the journey with women who come to the bowser.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:29.000
When coming from their country, they feel that it's taking me, I was like, it's the end

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000
of me.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Now I have to start all over again.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000
Some of them came to seek the relief to the bowser, but they started their life again,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
though up and down.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
They finally go to where they are supposed to be, through bowser.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
So they, from the darkness to the light again.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
The same thing is with this one.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:57.000
If it stops, there must be something because there is a lot of technologies in this country.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
There is a way to go through to the other side.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
So I was thinking of comparing that to it.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
That's a lovely metaphor.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Yeah.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000
It's a beautiful metaphor you're saying that there's always more sunlight coming.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Yeah, they use the solar system.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000
So you think bowser is like the solar power?

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Yeah, it's like the solar power to where it is.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:29.000
Not really, but yeah, it is because the women come here thinking that outside there, they

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
don't think that their life will be the same.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Maybe some of them going to the next of our ends, FGM, all sorts of things.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000
But then they come to bowser, they met that faces, that people who cared for them, that

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
people you tell them what to do.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
You can get the money, you can seek the work, you can do this.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
And their life starts again.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000
Until then they leave the bowser and start their life in a bright way, you see.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
So it's like this anyway, because it can stop anywhere.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.000
And then they do their technology and they can start again.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000
That's beautiful.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
Yeah.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000
That's really beautiful.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Yeah.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Thank you for that.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:17.000
That's great because a lot of people would walk past that and they wouldn't really think

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000
about it.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
Yeah, it's not using the petrol rapper.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
You can learn it.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000
They have to use some things of which I don't know.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000
But to me it's a solar system.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Something which is telling me it's to do with the nature, is it?

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Solar power.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Solar power.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
So it absorbs the rays of the sunlight.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:47.000
And then they have little cells, little cells that can absorb that and convert the UV rays

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000
into electricity.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
That's how it works.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000
So yeah.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
It needs the sun rays.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
No, it needs the sun rays, yeah.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
But there's no sun rays somewhere.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.000
It stores it.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000
Yeah, okay.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000
What will happen is it will store the energy.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Or if it's quite sort of basic technology, it will just run on what it has.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
So for example, if it's not sunny that day, it won't work.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
But a lot of bigger technologies, they'll have the ability to store it.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000
Okay.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:25.000
But your metaphor still works because what you're saying is that even if the sunlight

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
runs out, it always comes back.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
There's always a new beginning.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
There's always hope.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Yeah.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
And places like Baozhou provide that hope and that sun ray.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Yeah.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000
That is it.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Yeah.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000
So that's lovely.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Thank you.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000
I love that.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Anything else from the museum?

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000
From museum, that was a typewriter from there.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:55.000
There is another one in this one from the St. Fagans, I think.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Yes.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000
Yeah, that's St. Fagans.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000
This is the type of fire we use.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000
Yeah.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Oh, can I see?

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Yeah.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Oh, from the bakery.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Yeah.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Now, when I saw this, I just remember how I was baking for my children.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000
Most of the food we could call for rich people.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:31.000
Because I was a teacher, students were coming to eat in my house, and they thought the chapati.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
You have heard of chapati?

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
The flat bread?

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000
The flat bread was for the rich people, the teachers.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000
The only people, the rich people, they can't cook that one.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000
It was so expensive.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000
And this one, I was baking.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000
I was rolling.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000
I was doing the balls and keeping them.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000
I was counting.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000
I have four children.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000
This is for my four children.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:02.000
This is for to take to school for the children who will not be having some food.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000
And this is to keep for the morning.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000
So this one, the way they put the balls, it's not here.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000
It's not showing.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000
I think I printed one.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
There are some balls here.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000
We were counting when cooking.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000
The dough?

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000
The dough, yeah.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
We were counting when cooking.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:29.000
You should make sure the dough will come back five, according to the children, they have 111, and to give out like five, 111.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000
So this one, it made me of how I was doing it.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000
It was some memories which gave me.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:42.000
And so I can see those children now which I was giving there because they were so poor.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Now they are the people with so many big, big things back in Kenya.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
They didn't go to secular school.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000
They didn't need to go to secular school.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Their parents had no money, but they needed to do the business to make them people.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000
They are very, very rich.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:08.000
So when I saw this, I was like, maybe I should do the bit so that it can fit for my children.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:19.000
If I see it's not fit, I started moving some of the dough from here, here, here, here to make another dough so that when cooking, it will be enough for the children.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000
But if I got Kenya, those are the people I can see.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
Even they are doing better than me.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.000
So do you mean that you would have a ball and then you'd split it and just make it go farther?

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000
Yeah.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000
So you would call it a dough ball?

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
A dough ball, those balls.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000
I have to cut it again until I get that round.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
If I do it, if I lift it, it will be small.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
Everybody will have a piece, a piece, a piece, a piece.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
So why was chapati so expensive?

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000
Because I always thought that that was sort of an affordable food.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Why was chapati so expensive?

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:05.000
It's because by then it was for the rich people.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000
It was very expensive.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Even if you hear the smell from afar, the poor children from the poor families could just pass by your house, up and up, up and down, until you tell them to come for the piece.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000
It was for even us to get when we were growing.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000
It was a magic.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000
Yeah, it was very expensive.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000
Very, very expensive.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
The wheat, the flour.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Yeah, the flour, yeah.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:41.000
And is there any kind of fat in it as well, like a butter or an oil?

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Oil, we cook with oil.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000
We fry with oil in the pan.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.000
You can go and see how.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000
If you see them go out to cook chapati, you will see it.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000
It was very nice.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:59.000
And I know I don't do it because if you do it, the wheat here is not like the wheat we are growing back in our country.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:09.000
I have to be careful if you have cancer, genes, you need to be very careful with some of the things.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
But some of the foods?

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Yeah.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Some of the things like wheat, processed meat, like sausages, bacon.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Yeah, those things are not good for the cancer patient.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Yeah, those are the kind of things I was told to keep away.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Interesting.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000
I had a housemate, I used to have a housemate from Tanzania, she would make chapati.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
Wow, yeah, they know how to do it.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000
It's really good.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000
Yeah.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Really good with curries and everything.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000
Yeah, this is the commandant.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000
I just closed this bridge for a purpose.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:57.000
This bridge was there from the museum building to go to where our bus was.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
We closed the bridge.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:05.000
I was thinking about it and I had to call somebody from very far to take me a photo.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:12.000
I was thinking about the, I thought about how we close out, how we were ready to come into my commandant.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:18.000
You see, we were very late, so we didn't go back in the commandant, you remember?

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:27.000
There was a lot of stuff which went on in the morning, then in the evening we had not much to talk about in commandant, if you remember very well.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.000
So when I was closing this bridge, I just looked under the water.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:40.000
You see that there was enough, there was not much in that building, it's just to do the wool.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000
But it gave me a memory of the skirt.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:53.000
I, I, the, by then the wool is that, if a girl happened to wear a woolen, you are so expensive.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:59.000
So we are going to various centers.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000
We went like this here, we call them charity.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Ours was not a charity, it was like somewhere nearby, close come from various outside the Kenya,

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000
and they were put somewhere, people buy and sell it to the other people.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000
So the center charity here.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000
So we were taken every Saturday to check whether we would get a woolen.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000
We don't know where we are coming from.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:34.000
So when I saw that skirt, I remembered the first time I bought a woolen, it was my, I went to face my boyfriend,

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000
and he was so happy because I'm wearing a woolen and whatever.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Then when my mum, my mum discovered that I went to see the boyfriend, I was in the second school,

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:54.000
I was beaten and beaten and my mother threw the woolen, that woolen skirt away and told me you never wear it again.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:01.000
When I saw that, that woolen again in the command, and I was like, this give me a memory.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000
I went to see my boyfriend, my mother beat me and threw my woolen again.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Though I cannot get that one, it gave me that memory center.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Yeah.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000
I was thinking about this earlier.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:25.000
I was thinking about when you told that story, you know, we were all laughing because it was so the idea of you being in a sort of dusty,

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:31.000
you know, Nairobi street with these woolen skirts, you know, going around.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000
Yeah, and it was, yeah.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:41.000
And because it is woolen, somebody was like, woolen skirt, woolen skirt.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:48.000
And that one is not like the nowadays whereby men are attracted by seeing something, sort something.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Now, by our time, it's the kind of dress, it's woolen, even if it is dirty, the fit is very nice, you see.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000
Yeah.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:08.000
So it strikes me as a mixed memory because then you said your mum, your mother was physically, hurt you physically.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000
Yeah.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000
So our parents were very strict.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:25.000
In comparing with the woolen nowadays, it was, it was a, this spring was there, but not anymore.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:39.000
That's what I told you when we, when we started the inter-internet, a home, you have to put a bridge, call it a home when you are with the youth or dealing with youth.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.000
Yeah.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.000
Otherwise, you know, it can be, you can lose your home anytime.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.000
Anytime you try to strike, he call the police.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:54.000
You know what you call the police, you see, and you might lose your children.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:59.000
So you have to, there is a bridge whereby you can close and where you cannot close.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:15.000
In our days, our, my mum threw my skirt away just because it's the one which attracted the man to, yeah, because it was expensive, it was woolen, it was, yeah, by then.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:21.000
Why do you think wool was so attract, was so, you know, why was wool sexy?

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000
Why was wool...

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:27.000
I don't know why, it's like fashion.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:33.000
It was fashion, the way you see something in fashion, but in the next few years, it's same.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:43.000
Yeah, so woolen was on fashion back when I was growing, woolen, it was very uncommon to find an woolen skirt, woolen things, yeah.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000
So it was fashionable at that time.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000
Was it very hot to wear it?

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:57.000
It was hot, but regardless, even when it's hot, you could wear it to tell people you are wearing an woolen, hot or woolen skirt.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:03.000
And that is the most thing we could wear to go and get, go to our boyfriend.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.000
Yeah, very expensive, but...

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000
Is there anything else you wanted to share?

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Nordic Weavers. Nordic Weavers gave me a...

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.000
Oh, yeah.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.000
You know the Sreti Museum?

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.000
The Sreti Museum was marvelous, it was nice.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:38.000
The man who was doing the Sreti, there, they told us the rocks or whatever they called them, it came from there, all allowed somewhere there.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:45.000
I thought when I went outside, I looked at the hill somewhere, this one.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:50.000
Then I was thinking about my life.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Yeah, I looked at it, the edge, and the man told us these things come from there.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:03.000
I was, I just was like, believing he was copying the...

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:18.000
That thing. He got it like, surplus, you know, because when you get a log, it's a, it's a, it's something which you cannot admire, the log, according to me.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:32.000
But that man, the way he was cutting it, he was making some things with very beautiful, he shaped that log, the logs and the, the logs, and it was so, it looks something very nice.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:39.000
I, I thought about it, about the life I started.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:44.000
I started my life when I was very hungry.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Then I was like, a log.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Somebody put my life like, nobody could admire me, admire me, nobody could like, you know, because I was so mistress.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:02.000
Then I came to UK.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:07.000
I, you know, I had to run away and come to UK.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:11.000
With that shape.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.000
And I had to put myself in it.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:22.000
Then I got the problems, I started like, I started the, I had cancer.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.000
And I was operated.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.000
By that, I was thinking about it.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000
When I came out from the museum, I was thinking about it.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000
I want to take me a photo of what it feels like to me.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.000
My life, the way here, this is logs.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000
They are shapeless.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:48.000
I could see that life, that it's my life, this is the life I, it was like.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.000
Then somebody came back in man.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:57.000
The logs was taken and the man started shaping and shaped something very nice.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Although I had the stomach, I remembered that.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Although what I went through in my life, it didn't take my heart.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000
I was given a heart.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:14.000
You see, I see this didn't break my heart.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000
That's so beautiful.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.000
Thank you for sharing that.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Everyone really loved those, didn't they?

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.000
I think that was a really powerful gesture, wasn't it?

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000
Yeah, it was.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000
And the man doing it, you know.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:36.000
Sometimes can be shaped and they can be like logs.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000
And somebody can put it together.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000
Shape, you can see, you're doing it like that.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.000
But once you are given like this, I was like.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.000
Then I look at the logs, where they see that the logs come from locally.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.000
I could see those logs.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:58.000
Then they take the logs, they shape them and, you know, it was so lovely.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.000
Yeah, that is it.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000
Yeah, amazing.
