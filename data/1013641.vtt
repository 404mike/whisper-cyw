00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
nes.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
When he heard the cry, Oh, die you, not at all,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Oh, die you, not at all, Oh, die you, not at all,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
He is the Lord.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And we stand now, let's all sing.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
O come, all ye faithful,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Joyful and triumphant,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000
O come ye, O come ye to heaven.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
O come, and be all ye,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
For the King of angels.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
O come, let us adore him.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
O come, let us adore him.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.000
O come, let us adore him, Christ the Lord.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And the last verse on the next day,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Oh, die you, not at all,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Oh, die you, not at all,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Oh, die you, not at all,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Oh, die you, die you,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
He is the Lord.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And the last verse on the next day,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Oh, die you, not at all,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Oh, die you, not at all,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Oh, die you, not at all,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Oh, die you, die you,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
He is the Lord.
