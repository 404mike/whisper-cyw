00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Croiso, welcome.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.500
As Hugh Perry said, I've just come from Algeria, but I was not basking.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.000
It was it was raining all day one day I was there and the weather was much nicer in Seattle,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
so don't feel envious for me.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.600
I work in the marketing department of one of the more well-known airplane manufacturers around here,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.720
and I want to do a very quick marketing survey.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.680
You just bear with me. How many people were with us last year at the Gamandva?

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.840
You raise your hands, please.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.980
Okay, how many people were here the year before?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Good.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:47.200
Now, how many of you were in Gamandva's hell here in Seattle back in the good old days when there was the Welsh Church?

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.480
Anybody?

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.400
Good.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.400
Okay, now the key question. Who has never been to a Gamandva before?

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.920
Oh my, well that's encouraging because we're getting in new blood.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.160
I'm going to address my next remarks specifically to you people and

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:14.480
the key words are don't worry about what to do. There are no rules. This is a very informal event.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The idea is to have fun.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.320
Tim Dick, our director, will tell you exactly what to do and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.520
he'll take good care of you.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.280
Now, if you get warm singing, as I always do, take your coats off.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.040
You'll see the choir's already starting to get informal and I'm going to do the same thing.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.560
I'm convinced that I could survive in the Arctic as long as I could keep singing to keep my temperature up.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.600
I can already start to see vocal cords twitching, so I'm not going to talk much longer.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.360
All I ask is that you sing

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.240
from the heart and

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.360
tenors or aspiring tenors,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.360
there are no substantiated case of permanent physical injury resulting from straining for high notes.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.360
And now let me just say,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.360
Deoch canu nir ar gloib,

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.360
Come sing to the Lord.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.360
Tim Dick, our director, will now lead us.
