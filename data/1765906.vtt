00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.360
Hello, I'm Sharon and I work at Mencap but for the last nine years I've been the

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.400
leader of Masquerade which is an integrated theatre company for people

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.560
with and without learning disabilities based here in Llanfellin.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.560
Would you like to introduce yourself Rob?

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.560
Hi, I'm Rob.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.560
And where do you live Rob?

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.120
Llanfellin.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:36.560
Now Rob, I've been leading Masquerade like I just said for about, this is my ninth year

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.560
but you have been doing Masquerade longer than that.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.560
Yeah, I'm going to be in charge of it this time.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.560
Great, I think that would be perfect.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.560
I'll be the teacher.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.560
When it comes to me to say bye bye, my work here is done.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.560
I'll have to pass it over to you Rob.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.560
Yeah.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.560
You've been a brilliant leader.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.560
Yes.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.560
So tell me what do you really like doing in Masquerade?

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.560
What are your favourite things out of all the things that we do?

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.560
Shall I remind you of some of the things we do?

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.560
First and foremost we are performers.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:16.560
So we act, we sing, we dance, but we also do lots of art things don't we?

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.560
We make scenery and we make props.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.560
So out of all them, which are the things that really fire you up?

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.560
Which things do you really like doing?

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.560
Could it be the acting and the singing?

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.560
Yeah.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.560
Because when I see you, you take it all so seriously, you get all your fantastic costumes

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.560
and your masks and then you perform with complete focus out to the audience.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.560
Do you enjoy doing that?

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.560
Yeah.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.560
Why do you enjoy performing so much?

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.560
Do you know?

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.560
Is it just something that comes naturally to you?

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.560
Yeah.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.560
I think you're right because out of everybody in Masquerade, all you need to do is put on

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:10.560
some item of clothing or costume and you just become that character in your body straight away.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.560
And even on Zoom, which is much more difficult to be focused on,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.560
sometimes you've come on and you've come on in a mask or a costume and you've literally

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.560
stayed in that mask and been in that character for the whole of Zoom.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.560
It's amazing.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.560
You're so good at getting into characters and being other people.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.560
Oh yeah.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.560
So tell us something about singing because you really love singing as well, don't you?

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.560
Yeah.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.560
I'm just showing my voice.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.560
How's it?

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.560
It could tickle there.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.560
You have to do some voice warm-ups.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.560
What do we do for warming up voices?

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.560
Mmm.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.560
Mmm.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.560
Or aah.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.560
Or la la la la la.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.560
Fabulous.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.560
Well done.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.560
Yeah.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.560
So when we do our Masquerade performances, what are your favourite songs that you like to sing?

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.560
Mmm.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.560
I'm thinking about musicals really.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.560
Yeah, that's why I got a CD at home.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.560
Mmm.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.560
So out of all the things we've done, all the songs we've sung, what was your favourite

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.560
song that you've ever done?

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.560
I think it's Joseph and Lesley.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.560
But I've got a DVD now.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.560
Yeah.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.560
It's a real one this time.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.560
Fantastic.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.560
You know, they're brilliant.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.560
I know you're a big fan of Les Mis.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.560
I know you've seen it like a hundred, probably a hundred times.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.560
Yeah.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.560
I'm not going in London yet because there are no trains running yet.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.560
And the theatres haven't opened yet either.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.560
No.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.560
All series B ones.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.560
Because Dermot's going to book one in series B.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.560
Yeah, they're meant to be opening later this month.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.560
Yes.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.560
I think it will be, Be Dean the Beast.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.560
Oh, I'm going to be sitting right at the front.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.560
Brilliant.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.560
Well, I just wanted to talk about your favourite song that you sang when you had the lead part,

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.560
which was Any Dream Will Do, and Joseph.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.560
Can you tell us if you enjoyed that?

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.560
Yeah, we must do it again.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.560
You were fantastic.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.560
You had your beautiful multicoloured dream coat on.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.560
Did my dad come to it?

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.560
Yes, your dad came to it.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.560
And he was so impressed afterwards because it was the first time you'd done a solo.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.560
Normally, you were always in the group and the chorus.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.560
Yes, I think the light was shining in my eyes.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.560
Yeah, on the stage, that's right.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.560
The light shining in your eyes.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.560
So you were very brave, weren't you?

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.560
Yeah.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.560
Very brave.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.560
And you took it on.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.560
Yeah, and I didn't need to go for a week because you know how to hold it in.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.560
No, and you know what's really good is, Rob, since I began...

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.560
I was flaredesh with her, wasn't I?

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.560
Since I began, you used to get so nervous at the beginning of shows.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.560
You were just almost so anxious.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.560
I was going to be sick.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.560
You were going to be sick.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.560
You wanted to go to the loo all the time and it was really almost so difficult for you.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.560
But I think over the years, you've got much, much better.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.560
So I wouldn't say you're relaxed now, but I would say you're so much more confident.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.560
Would you agree with that?

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.560
Yeah.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.560
Yeah, you're so confident in your performances.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.560
Because when I look back at all those DVDs of all the shows, you really stand out

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.560
because your performances are so out there, so confident, so focused.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.560
You know exactly what to do and you do it.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.560
And it looks amazing.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.560
And the audience, they just believe it.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.560
They believe in everything you're doing and it's great.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.560
So well done, you.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.560
So I also thought we could just have a quick talk about all the places in Lambethlin that we've performed.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.560
So I think since it's begun, we've done St. Muthlin's Day.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.560
So can you remember what we'd usually do at St. Muthlin's Day in the town?

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.560
Yeah, the parade.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.560
We must do that again.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.560
Yeah, we must do that again. We do the parade.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.560
So what do we do in the parade as masqueraders?

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:25.560
Yeah, yeah, we get our instruments and our drums and we dress up, don't we?

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.560
And we go all together in a long train.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.560
Sometimes we've got...

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.560
Oh yeah, the Maverick one.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.560
And that as well, yeah, yeah.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.560
Sometimes we've got our cups.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.560
And especially when they wind up.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.560
Cup.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.560
Trophy, it's gone back to Nicola.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.560
It's gone back to...

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.560
The Maverick show.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.560
For the best costume.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.560
So, yes, so we must get that back again.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.560
That's right.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.560
I don't know who's going to win it now.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.560
I don't know.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.560
It won't be me this time.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.560
I don't think it'll be on this year, Rob, so don't worry about that.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.560
But yeah, we performed at Myford.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:03.560
We did Space and we did the Plastic Queen, remember, the environmental show.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.560
Did a couple of shows at Myford and we paraded a little bit there, didn't we?

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.560
And where else have we done?

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.560
We've done there, we've done the town in St. Muthlin's Day.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.560
Oh, Crosskeys.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.560
Oh yeah.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.560
And we did a performance in the Crosskeys, a fundraiser.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.560
Yeah, you bet.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.560
Next time, make sure it's been the right place.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:28.560
I think maybe we could do it in Newtown for a change.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.560
Yeah, we could.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.560
Yeah, so sugar mom could actually come out and watch it.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.560
You've done one in Newtown just before I started at the Monty Club.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.560
Remember that, with Iris?

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.560
I think we'd better do that again and go outside.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.560
I'll talk to Sian about that.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.560
That's a good idea, something in Newtown.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.560
Yeah.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.560
Outside, yeah, in that lovely park there.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.560
Yeah.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.560
Yeah, that would be a really good idea.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.560
Yeah, I'll do that.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.560
Yeah, brilliant.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.560
So mom could see it this time.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:03.560
She could come out from the shop and I think that'd be quite nice for her to come out too.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.560
Yeah, and see you in Newtown, because you grew up in Newtown, didn't you?

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.560
Yeah.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.560
Yeah, so not too far away.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.560
Brilliant idea.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.560
Well, is there anything else you'd like to talk about to do with Masquerade?

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.560
Anything else you'd like to do?

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.560
We have done a lot of things, I have to say.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:26.560
Looking back, we've done pirates, ghosts, around the world in 59 minutes.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.560
What else have we done?

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.560
Fairy tales.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.560
We've done the Greeks, Here Come the Greeks.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.560
That's the last one we did, wasn't it?

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.560
Yeah.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.560
And do you know that Masquerade in the town is very valued by people?

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:46.560
People absolutely love coming to see Masquerade, because more than anything else, they say it really cheers them up.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:54.560
I have people saying Masquerade is like the local panto when we do our Christmas show.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.560
Bless you.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:01.560
Yeah, so that's why we always get a good audience, really, because people want to come and see you, because you make them happy.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.560
Yeah, I mean, I love it.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.560
Yeah, there we go.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:14.560
Right then, well, it's been lovely to chat, and let's hope Masquerade comes back soon, in all its glory.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.560
It's been OK on Zoom, hasn't it?

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.560
At least we've kept in touch with each other and seen each other.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.560
Yeah.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.560
How have you found it on the computer?

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.560
It's nice.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.560
You've enjoyed it, yeah, good, good.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.560
Have you seen on mum's iPad?

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.560
Oh, yes.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.560
I've seen you on mum's iPad, yeah, you often come on when you're at mum's.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.560
Yeah, because I left mine behind.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.560
Oh, right.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.560
Oh, don't worry, we'll get you on next week on somebody's computer, it'll be fine.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.560
Oh, yeah.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.560
Anyway, brilliant. Well, it's lovely to chat, Rob.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.560
I'll see you next Wednesday, Masquerade, 6.30 on Zoom.
