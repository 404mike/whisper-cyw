00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
Oh, things like, you know, not particularly Welsh things, but the Bloody Sunday in 1972

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:14.600
in Londonderry. I remember watching the coverage of that and being fairly horrified by it.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:21.460
The Falklands War, of course, that was very much in my mind. I'll never forget the coverage

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:29.800
of that because my son was born just at the start of it. So, you know, it was on until

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:39.800
TV all the time. Oh, the other thing was that sinking of the ferry, the Herald of Free Enterprise.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:47.360
That's another thing I can remember seeing on TV. And the big hurricane in 1987, where

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.320
Michael Fish said the weather was going to be alright. And was it five out of the seven

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:02.720
in Kent were destroyed. Oh, I can remember Margaret Thatcher's resignation as well. The

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.220
Hillsborough disaster, the Lockerbie disaster, of course. And the Piper Alpha disaster. They're

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.320
all disasters that stick in my mind.
