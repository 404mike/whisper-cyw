00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.360
Carter Carnival 25th Anniversary Project, interviewer Steve Fletcher, interviewee Jane

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:15.520
Winterbottom. Today's date is the 13th of October 2015 and the location of the interview

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.720
is the Swiffer office. Jane, before we start, would you be kind enough to spell your name

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.160
in full please?

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.680
J-A-N-E-W-I-N-T-E-R-B-O-W-T-O-N.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.400
Thank you very much. Jane, can you remember when you first made contact with Carter Carnival?

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.600
Yes, it was through a friend of mine who was involved with it anyway. She wanted someone,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:45.800
they needed people in the carnival so I volunteered. I did the workshops, made, what year was it,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.600
do you know, it was 2010?

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.080
2010, yes.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.600
So me and a friend went to the workshops and we made our ladies in waiting costume, did

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.720
the carnival. I also did a St. David's Day parade as well because they were short of

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.200
people so I volunteered for that and then got involved with the swicker, you know, the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.200
carnival workshops.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.200
Got it. In the St. David's Day parade, were you a red dragon in big wings?

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.200
I was a red dragon.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.200
Was it sunny that St. David's Day?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.200
Yes, it was.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.200
Excellent.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.360
Yes, it was a lovely day actually, yes, it was really good. It was the first sort of

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.360
time I'd done the actual parade and it was really exciting.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.960
Excellent. Of course, with wings on, they're relatively light and reasonably good in a

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.960
high wind but of course...

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.960
It was a bit windy and they were going over our faces a bit so we had to...

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.960
Veiled dragons present stumbling into a manhole.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.960
Yes, it was good fun. There was a good crowd actually watching us so that makes a difference.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.560
But from a relatively light pair of wings, you progressed in your carnival career to

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.560
wearing a much bigger costume. Would you care to tell us...

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.560
Yes, I was a football. A very heavy football.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.560
It's great, lovely. I was a football.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.560
I was a football.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.560
The main football, which was very heavy. I had it on my shoulders.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.560
On a backpack?

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.160
On a backpack, yes, which is quite hard to keep up actually. You don't realise as you're

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.160
walking, it's very heavy. You put it on, you think, oh, it'll be fine. And then as you're

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.160
walking, because it's quite a long route, you're walking for about at least an hour.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
90 minutes is quite normal.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
Oh yeah, an hour and a half. And you're supposed to try and do it...

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
Including getting ready because of course you've got to get it all new.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.160
You've got your face paint done, you've got to get everything set up as well. So you've

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.160
been on for a long time and it gets heavier as you go, definitely. And I think it was

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.160
raining then as well, so everything was wet and everything was coming off.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
Slowly disintegrating in the parade.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.160
Yes, slowly, leaving a trail of glitter and sequins as we walked along. But no, because

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
all the face paint was going as well because everything was in face paint and of course

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.160
it was raining.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
It starts to run. It's a good look.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
Yeah, it is a good look.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.160
And what music were you dancing to?

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160
It was the...

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
Wonder Brass?

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.160
Wonder Brass, that's right.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.160
Excellent.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.160
They keep us going. Good morale, so everyone's having a dance. So yeah, you've got to dance

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.160
with your back.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.160
And you were sort of like the mothership to a satellite.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
Yes, I had a lot of little couples behind me.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
You had a lot of little couples behind you, but they weren't all back backs.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
Yeah, they were just dressed up and they just had little sort of...

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.160
If I understand correctly, I think this was entirely attributed to the fact, was it the World Cup?

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.160
The World Cup, yes it was.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.160
Absolutely. So it wasn't completely random.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.160
No, no, it had a meaning.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.160
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.160
But after your adventures in Carnival, you then got involved with our regular performance

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.160
group, the Carnival crew.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.160
Yes.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
Tell us more about that. How did you get involved and what were your experiences?

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.160
That was through Caroline again.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.160
Right.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.160
Yes.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
She's got a lot to answer for, hasn't she?

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.160
She's a hefty recruiter.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.160
Right, right.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.160
Well, after that experience, I just thought, yeah, actually I quite like it.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.160
So I'll do it.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.160
I'll do it.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.160
So yeah, I started doing the bells, which was great.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
There was me and about three others doing the bells.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.160
Excellent.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
Of course, people doing drums and things like that.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.160
I can't remember my first gig, but we did a couple.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.160
We did a parade in Newport.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.160
We did Barry, an evening performance in Barry.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.160
Of course, Festival No. 6 as well.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160
Let's talk about Festival No. 6.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.160
So this is a wonderful and award winning festival in Portmurray in North Wales,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:37.160
which if people don't know is the fabulous sort of folly on a grand scale by the architect William Clough Ellis.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.160
Yes, it's an amazing place.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160
It's just so beautiful, isn't it?

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.160
Totally random, but just amazing.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.160
Random in a carnivalesque way.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.160
Oh, yeah, definitely.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.160
It sort of speaks to carnival, doesn't it?

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.160
Yes, totally.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160
It's just quirky and eccentric.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.160
Statues everywhere, nice colors, nice shapes.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.160
Yes, definitely.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.160
Yes.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:01.160
And in fact, so you'd been in the carnival crew the very first time that Swicker played Festival No. 6.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.160
And in fact, unless I'm mistaken, you were at the front of the parade, weren't you?

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.160
In mara-katu dresses, very brightly colored dresses.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.160
Yes, we were.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.160
Very much sort of opening the space.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
Yeah, I think the bells were at the front.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.160
I think Sally then us, the bells, yes, and then the drummers.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.160
So yeah, we were in the front of the parade, but that was amazing as well.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.160
That was brilliant.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.160
Coming down into the piazza.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.160
Yes.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.160
Yes, and then up onto the stage.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.160
But the reaction was brilliant.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.160
Yeah, I really enjoyed that.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.160
I think we did two days, didn't we?

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.160
Yes, absolutely.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.160
I mean, the big contribution that Swicker makes is the carnival.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.160
But of course, then you took in other performances in the piazza, didn't you?

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.160
All kinds of stuff.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.160
Yeah, we did.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.160
Which was absolutely smashing.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.160
I know.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.160
We did have a little bit of sun, but basically it was raining and we were camping.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.160
We were camping in a waterlogged field.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.160
We were camping in a waterlogged field.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.160
How was it for you?

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.160
My tent leaked and I was soaking, so it was all right.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.160
Trench foot, you know.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.160
That's a British festival experience, a Welsh festival experience.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.160
Definitely trench foot.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:08.160
I remember in the first year, we were incredibly lucky because whilst you're right, it was the wettest festival number six we've ever done.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.160
I remember arriving on a Thursday evening.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.160
It was totally bucketing down.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.160
And this carried on without stop.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.160
All the way through Friday.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:28.160
And then weirdly, in a very nice sort of way, 10 minutes before we opened the van to get the first costume off out for the carnival parade in the Saturday afternoon, suddenly the sun came out.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:34.160
And then 10 minutes afterward, put the last costume away, the sun disappeared again.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.160
And so that was great news for the carnival number six at the festival.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:46.160
I can just remember one odd moment where I'm at the front trying to make sure that there's some space for us to march into and the rest of it.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:57.160
And looking back and just looking and seeing yourselves, the carnival crew in the beautiful Brazilian style Maracatu costumes and looking up and seeing these hundreds of people and even more watching.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:04.160
And then realizing that over to a person, whilst from the ankles upwards, everybody looked very carnival.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:13.160
Of course, everybody had on the same footwear which they survived, which is that everybody, Sally and the dancers had different colored wellies on.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:21.160
So it was a beautiful, sunshiny carnival parade in Wellington Boots, which I thought in our 26 year history was a first.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160
So yes, absolutely.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.160
Yeah, I remember we were in wellies.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.160
All the crowds as well.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.160
We lived in wellies for that weekend.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.160
No, it was fantastic.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.160
That was fantastic.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.160
Well, thank you very much for your carnival memories.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.160
My pleasure.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:40.160
And well, you shall be entering history towards the end of the month.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.160
Lovely. Thank you very much.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.160
Thank you, Jane.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.160
That's okay. Thank you.
