00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
I'm Vicki MacDonald and I'm at Holy Trinity Church, Llandudno, for the longest yarn.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.400
And I'm going to speak to Beryl Evans and she's going to talk about her father during

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.400
the war.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.400
Thank you, Beryl.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.920
So, have you got lots of stories about your father?

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.720
Well, just one major story.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:24.360
My father was in the regular army in the 30s, came out in 1938, then was recalled for the

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.360
war.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:32.120
So the actual D-Day training was, I believe, down in Aldershot.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.280
Also my mother's sister, my uncle, was with him.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.760
So they were given a day's notice, 24 hours leave, to do what they want before they finally

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.120
went across to France.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.200
So what they did was they got up to London, spoke to the train driver.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.640
The train driver said, hop in the guards van, I'll drop you.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.520
He was on the London to Chester or whatever, Liverpool train.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.580
Jump in the guards van, I will drop you off at the nearest halt station near O'Haben.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.700
So that's what they did.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.040
They were dropped off roughly, say, 11 to 11.30 that evening near Rosamedri somewhere

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.600
at a small halt.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.840
He said, I will be returning in the morning and I will pick you up here.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.120
So what I actually remember is I wake up roughly 11 o'clock.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.080
This is what my mother's always told me, and I remember the time we heard knocking at the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.080
window.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.840
We were in a detached house in Acrobatie because my mother had moved back to the family home

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.480
for the war.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.160
So what it was, it was my father and my uncle having walked from the nearest station, throwing

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.480
pebbles at the window to wake us up.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.520
So my mother had the last few hours with my father.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.520
And then the next day they went back to Aldershot.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.520
And the train stopped for them?

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.560
Yeah, it slowed up at the small halt somewhere near Rosamedri.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.560
They jumped in the guards van and they returned back to London.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.520
That was a very dangerous escapade, wasn't it?

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.520
It was.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.520
Because they went AWOL, presumably.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.120
Obviously they were in uniform and that's why the guardsman understood.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.480
And the train driver.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:15.000
So they both went across to Caen, it was, on Caen beach.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.120
My father was badly wounded, badly shell-shocked.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.120
My uncle didn't make it.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.120
Goodness.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.800
And then I do remember my mum and my auntie being in mourning going for my uncle's funeral.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.040
But my father was badly shell-shocked, came back.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.660
He went into a Red Cross hospital in a hall in Warwickshire.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.560
The hall is still there, Shugbury Hall.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.320
It was the 14th baronet now.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:48.000
So when he fully recovered, he was given a job and a house down in Warwickshire.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So that's my story.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.480
He didn't go back to war then?

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.480
No, no, no.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.120
He was too badly injured.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.040
So he was injured on the beach?

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.720
In the beaches in Caen, yes.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.720
How was he shot?

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.720
He was shot, yes.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.800
He had a wound on his right side.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.240
And so after the war, did that problem bother him?

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.920
Badly shell-shocked.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.280
It took him a few years and my mother said he never really recovered.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.280
And then eventually...

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.600
And of course, it was his brother who died?

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.600
His brother-in-law.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.600
His brother-in-law died?

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.600
Yes, yes.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.600
Were they on the same beach together?

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.600
They were, yes, yes.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.600
How very sad for him.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:32.240
Yes, my father, my uncle was in the musical side of the army, so he was, I forget what

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.240
the term is now.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.240
Bandsman.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.320
Yes, and their duty was during the war to collect the bodies off the beach.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.320
With stretchers, yes.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.080
Yes, bare stretchers, yes, yes.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.040
So that's what my uncle was doing and he got shot.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.040
And he got shot and killed.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.040
Yes, yes.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.040
How very sad.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.040
He never came back.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.760
So I do remember that because I was actually born in 1940, so I was four when all this

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.760
was going on.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.760
So yes, that must have impacted on you at form, wasn't it?

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.760
Yes, yes.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.760
Great sadness.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.760
But what an extraordinary journey that they did.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.760
Yes, yes.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.160
I mean, they would have been absent without leave, wouldn't they?

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.640
Well, they were given 24 hours.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.640
Oh, they were given 24 hours.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.640
But that was only really for the vicinity around.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.640
Just to go have a drink in the local pub.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.640
Yes, but no, they thought, you know.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:19.600
How prescient of your uncle to come and, you know, maybe he perhaps knew that he was going

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.600
to die.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.600
It's extraordinary.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.000
You don't know what was going through their minds, do you?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
They probably did think that.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.720
Well, if we don't come back, we'll try and make it home one last time.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.720
Yes.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.720
And what a journey.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.720
Yes, yes.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.720
That is the most amazing story.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.720
Yes.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.920
Thank you very much for sharing it.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.840
That's so kind.
