WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
but how did you organise those tapestries?

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.840
We had a general, there was a little working,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.080
there was a little group of us who were sort of planning it.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.600
We had an artist who lived at Broad Oak at the time,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.320
Mary Strong, she was a brilliant artist.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.440
And so we said, you know, let's do some,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.440
cause I got some ideas and we needed everybody's input

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.100
to make it happen.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.100
So we held an open event and just invited everybody

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.700
to come along who was interested.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.700
And there was a lot of interest and we,

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.260
we probably had two or three of these.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.020
One was sort of like the brainstorming session,

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.260
what sort of things should we put in, should we include?

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.620
And then we went away and did some sketches.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.900
Jake did a lot of the sort of sketches as well.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.460
Cause what we thought we needed to do was

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.820
put little packs together where people could just choose

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.140
what they wanted to do.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.980
And it was open to everybody.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.420
It wasn't dependent upon you being brilliant

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.040
with a needle and thread.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.160
It was just, we wanted everybody to,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.020
who wanted to get involved to be,

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.060
have an opportunity to be involved.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.060
So we put together the drawing, the fabrics,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.380
because of course we've got this colour scheme going on

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.780
as well, which was seasonal.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.540
And put more little packs.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.260
And we did the first one and the last one, I think, first.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.740
So we did the one with the monks

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.420
and the one with the village green.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.500
And, you know, had an event in the village hall.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.940
People would just, and I put,

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.660
I kind of tried to do a sketch of how I imagined

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.060
it would look, the size of it,

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.060
and then these sort of pictures on them.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.020
So people just took, started taking them away.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.900
And then they started coming back in.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.740
Hugely exciting and, you know, beautiful pieces of work.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.820
A lot of effort had been put in to,

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.620
people who hadn't got as much skill,

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.120
put as much time and effort into it.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.460
And so they started to take shape.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.980
And then we'd be meeting in the hall,

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.820
in Victoria's kitchen.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.900
We'd be, the slight core of us,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.860
there must have been, I don't know,

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.180
about seven or eight, nine of us, maybe.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.980
We'd be meeting every Tuesday evening in Victoria's kitchen.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.540
It's a good excuse to have a nice glass of wine

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.380
and a chat, actually.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.300
I don't think we did that.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.180
I don't think we did much by way of sewing,

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.460
but we were just having a nice little get together.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.460
And that must have gone on for about two years,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.300
I should think, because we got,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.860
we got some help to sew it all together.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.500
I think Val helped us to actually sew it all together.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.780
Sew all the pieces together.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.460
And the bits that were joining them,

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.580
we had ribbons and we had some lovely velvet ribbon.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.460
It was really difficult to find ribbon the right width,

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.460
because I designed it to have this,

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.980
I think it was three inch ribbon,

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.380
not actually knowing that you couldn't get it anywhere.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.500
You couldn't get ribbon that was three inches wide

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.260
for love nor money.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.700
But while all this was going on,

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.780
I think we must have done a little press release

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.580
and somebody came to us,

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.620
I think it was the Prince's Trust came to us and said,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.700
oh, I saw in the paper that you're doing this.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.260
We'd like to, do you need any financial support?

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.420
I said, well, actually it would be really handy

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.900
to be able to buy some ribbon once we can find it

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.900
and maybe get it framed and pay a,

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.580
we needed help with various things anyway.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.460
So we then had a little bit of money.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.900
So I put this bit together to apply

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.860
and receive some money back.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.580
And then found eventually after a lot of searching,

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.020
ribbon of the right size.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.020
And it was velvet ribbon, it was beautiful ribbon,

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.420
but it was really expensive,

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.260
far more than I'd anticipated in my little sort of like

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.380
calculations on the back of the fact packet type thing.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.980
So I went back to the Prince's Trust and said,

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.580
actually this ribbon is a lot more expensive

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.740
than we budgeted for because we didn't realize

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.500
we couldn't find ribbon of the right size,

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.460
you know, in the local shop.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.140
So we had to order it and bless them.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.980
They said, oh, that's fine.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.700
We can accommodate that.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.900
So we managed to get the ribbon that we wanted bought.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.580
And if you go and see them, the colors

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.380
and the style of the ribbon is just absolutely beautiful.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.100
And we only bought as much as we needed

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.100
because we haven't got any, because it was so expensive.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.180
Anyway, so that came, it was a company called VV Rulo.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.700
I remember it vividly because Victoria found it

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.620
in one of her interior design magazines.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.020
She, in all the adverts in the back of these sort of

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.260
magazine sheets, she found this ribbon company.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.940
Cause of course we didn't have the internet in those days.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.260
It wasn't any way like that.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.980
We were pouring over the yellow pages

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.620
trying to find, you know, ribbon.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.380
Anyway, so we got it from this shop,

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.580
VV Rulo based down in London.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.860
Got this beautiful ribbon.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.820
And we got it framed by somebody,

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.460
a little framer in Kidderminster.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.020
Cause Jake and I were living in the week

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.740
in Kidderminster at the time.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.140
So I'd be going backwards and forwards.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.940
On a Wednesday morning, I'd go after the,

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.340
cause I wasn't going to give up the Tuesday nights

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.300
in Victoria's kitchen.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.300
So we got this little framer who lived a bit further

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.820
along the road from where we were living

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.580
to frame these wall hangings.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.540
And we did two first and then we did another two.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.180
So when we did two, we put them up and we had a party

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.540
because we were still fundraising.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.980
We did a lot of fundraising ourselves to pay for

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.260
these events and the wall hangings in particular.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.460
But we're also raising money for the big party,

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.780
New Year's Eve.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.380
So we had cake sales.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.380
I remember standing, selling cakes and pittled onions

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.940
and various things outside the station on Good Friday

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:16.980
in Landerendod.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.100
And we got quite a lot, cause somebody in Boots,

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.340
somebody who worked in Boots said,

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.340
actually the busiest day for us in Boots is Good Friday.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.500
So we thought that is what supplies.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.260
So we thought, well, a Good Friday is the day to,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.340
you know, have a cake sale.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.300
And isn't it, if that's the busiest day in Landerendod.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.300
So we did that and we did various fundraising events

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:43.940
in the village hall.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.940
We had a line dancing night, which was hilariously good fun.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.660
A line dancing night, which was to show off the two

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.940
wall hangings that we'd done and to raise a bit of money

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.940
to pay for the next two and to pay for all these other

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.180
events that we'd got lined up, including the village green.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.620
So it was a very busy time, the lead up to millennium

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.500
and a few years after that, because we hadn't finished

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.860
the wall hangings by the time of the,

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.060
I think we finished them in 2001.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.060
So it's kind of carried on.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.100
And I can't remember if we finished the,

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.100
I think we were still doing the village green,

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.940
doing some planting and, you know, making it,

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.980
finishing it off in the years after the millennium.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.340
But that was a really busy time period and really sort of

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:40.340
good community sort of spirit going on at that time.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.100
And of course we've got those beautiful wall hangings

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.340
to show for and a beautiful village green,

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:52.780
which is cared for now by the community council.
