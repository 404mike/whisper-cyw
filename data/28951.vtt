Court Coleman and the Old Pound

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Court Coleman is a manor house dating back to Tudor times.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
There is no evidence as to when the house was originally built, but there is believed to have been a dwelling on or near the site as far back as the 12th century.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The earliest date found is 1638, which is on the Tudor gateway that takes you to the garden house.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:32.000
During the Civil War, 1642-1651, Court Coleman was passed to John Watkins as recognition for his attachment to the parliamentary cause.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
He eventually moved back to Brecon and signed the house over to his younger brother.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The house was later bought by Hopkins Rees, who became Sheriff of Glamorgan and passed through several different hands before being bought by the Llewellyn family of Margam in 1837.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
William Llewellyn, a qualified doctor, was a ship surgeon until he was invalidated out of the Navy in 1837.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
There was a delay before Llewellyn could take over the house and he died in 1840 having never lived there.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
His son William took up the residence at 20 years of age.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
In 1844 he married Miss Knight of Tithigston, whose family still live at the hall in Tithigston, just outside Larveston.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
In 1854, William later became High Sheriff of Glamorgan, thereby following in the footsteps of the previous owner Hopkins Rees.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
William's son R.W. Llewellyn succeeded him and carried out extensive alterations on the house between 1906 and 1907.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
What are now the East Wing and Conservatory were previously stables.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Windows and wings were also added to either side of the house to give it the balanced look that it has today.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The old entrance was removed but can still be found at the back of the lily pond.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
An old sundial can still be seen above the porch.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The first inscription on the sundial was made by Hopkins Rees in 1766.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Then in 1906 a second inscription was added to it when it was restored, brought back to its former glory, some might say, by R.W. Llewellyn.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The house was inherited by his son, Lieutenant W.H. Llewellyn, who later became a Colonel.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The Colonel, as he was known throughout the village, lived in the house until his retirement.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.000
The manor house was then sold to Mr. G. Morgan, a retired headmaster from Bridgend, who during his time of ownership allowed the manor house to become dilapidated.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
In 1981, Court Common was converted into a hotel and has remained a thriving business to this day.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Further along the route you will pass the Old Pound.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
The Old Pound was originally built to secure stray animals such as cattle and sheep.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Villagers would leave the stray livestock here where they could be collected by farmers.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Over the years it became derelict, but was restored in 1985 under the Ogur Community Environmental Scheme.
