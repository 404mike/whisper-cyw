00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
My name was a bit of a difficulty because there were various other people whose name began with A and

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.040
There was a tendency to pick a name in which both your surname and your Christian name would have the same initials in case

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.040
I've embroidered handkerchiefs or what have you

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.580
Andrews and Anderson all the obvious A's had already gone

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.280
But at that moment an Avro Anson happened to fly overhead

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.280
and it struck me as a very

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:41.280
short and agreeable name and not very common name so at that moment I became Anson and the Klaus in my original name became Colin

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:52.280
The middle name of Edward is purely on the spur of the moment because Captain Hilton Jones looked up and said no middle name

00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:05.280
I don't have a middle name, it's usual to have a middle name so I simply picked that out of fresh air and that is how Klaus Leopold Octavio Asher was made into Colin Edward Anson
