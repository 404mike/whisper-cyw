00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Life in Glyncorug. Life for a child during the coal mining days of the village was said to be exciting.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The village children dammed the River Corug, providing a makeshift swimming pool, though it was dirty from the coal waste.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The surrounding mountainous area is described as being like an adventure playground for children.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The coal tips in the village provided a source of coal for miners who were out of work.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Village children would also be sent to the tips to gather coal for their mothers to cook with.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
They risked being caught by the line manager and his men, who according to locals would put a boot up your backside.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
In the summer, women and children would collect windberries from the mountainside,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
whilst men would snare rabbits found on the forest edge or pick fresh mushrooms when they were in season.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
At one time they were said to poach trout from the stream, but as coal production increased the river became more and more polluted.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Whatever was gathered would supplement the household later when times were lean.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Most miners in the village had an allotment, which would provide the family with fresh vegetables when they were in season.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The allotments provided an economic value to miners, but also had a social aspect.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The men would spend hours cultivating their strips of land and passing the time with their workmates.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Most boys in the village were expected to follow their fathers into the pit, while girls followed their mothers into early wedlock.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The day that a boy entered the pit for the first time is when they would first be considered a man.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
For the first few years of mining life, the young men would work alongside their fathers until eventually they were allowed to cross them in the pit.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
To cross means that they would be working in the same stall or place, but on opposite shifts.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
It was said to be a proud moment when a young man was told he was good enough to cross his father in the pit.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
When the young men and their fathers came home from the pit, there would be buckets of water on the fire for them to bathe.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The procedure for most families would be as follows.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
The first to bathe would strip the top half of his body and kneel down in front of the bath, washing the top half of his body.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
His back would be washed by the next one to bathe.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Whilst the first bather would be wiping the top half of his body, the second bather would get on with washing his top half.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
The first bather would then strip naked and get into the bath to wash his bottom half.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
If there were more than two bathing, then the water would be changed.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Some miners would not have their backs washed until the very last shift of the week, believing that washing it every day would weaken it.
