00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm going to ask you some more questions about your family now and how it was for you growing up.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So, were your parents born in London?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:23.000
My mother was. My father was born in Poland or somewhere in Eastern Europe.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So, had he been here long? Had he grown up? Or had he just come over when he met your mother?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:46.000
No, he came over when he was 13. And I don't know what age he was when he met my mother.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Right.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
But he knew her a while before they married.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Was he working?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Yes. He had brothers and sisters who had come to this country. Most of them were in Merthyr.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Right.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And when he came, he couldn't speak a word of English. But they gave him a tray with handkerchiefs on it

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and told him to say handkerchiefs penny each and to sell them at 13. That was...

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Yes.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Yes.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So, presumably the whole family had come over. He hadn't come on his own at 13.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:14.000
No, he was probably the last to come over on his own. He travelled on his own, I expect.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Yes. So, he travelled over to...but he had older siblings here already who gave him the tray and the handkerchiefs.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Yes.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Right. And they were in London. He came to London to start with.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I don't know if it was to start with or whether it was Merthyr.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Interesting that they came to Merthyr so early on.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I don't know the reason and if I did, I've forgotten it.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Of course, Merthyr was a very busy, booming place because of the industry around the 1900s with the coal industry.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Yes.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Yes.
