My grandmother's recordings cover four CDs.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.160
That's four CDs.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.160
And your grandmother was?

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.160
Doris Irene Hall.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.160
Doris Irene Hall.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
Irene?

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.160
Irene, yeah.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
And actually her grandmother.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.200
Yes, grandmother. And her maiden name was Richards.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.200
She was born on 31st of July.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.200
Yeah.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.200
In 1914.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.200
She left Wales when she was 14 to go into service down in London.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.200
It's all on here.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.200
And then she immigrated to New Zealand in 1969.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.200
And she died there in 1989.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.200
Which is when she made these recordings.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.200
So these are recordings that she made about her life?

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.200
Yeah, and they're wonderful.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.200
Really wonderful.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.200
And you're donating?

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.200
I'm donating these.
