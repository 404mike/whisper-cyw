00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.440
Recording made by Glenys James in Ponoka, Alberta on the 3rd of July 1974 with several

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.620
members of the Welsh settlement. The interviews are in English and in Welsh, starting in English

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:26.240
with Griffith Jones, followed by a group interview with Hugh Roberts, Mrs Annie Roberts, Kelt

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.080
Hughes, Evan Thomas, Garonwy Davies and Yorwith Davies.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:14.280
Mr Griffith Jones, you were born in Canada of Welsh parents.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:31.760
Since we did not speak Welsh in the home, I didn't learn Welsh when I should have and I

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:40.160
regret it since. However, I do like to hear the Welsh and one of the biggest thrills I had in

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:47.920
visiting Wales this summer was to hear the little children speak it. It sounded good. Dad

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:57.680
came from Wales, Tre Gyrfaen, first in 1891 and after several trips back came out again in 1910

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:05.720
and settled in the Wood River District. Mother is of Welsh, was of Welsh parents and she came from

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:15.080
the United States to Canada in 1902 and they were married in 1911. There were four of us that were

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.360
born to them and probably I speak as good of Welsh as any of them which isn't very good.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:32.120
Now your father was well known in the area here for his Welsh writing of England Neon both Welsh

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.360
and English. He was well known all over North America in fact because he contributed to the

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:47.000
Welsh papers and he competed in all the Welsh Estadwods that he could with his England Neon

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.720
and he won many prizes with them. Can you recall any of these England Neon that he wrote? I could

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:06.600
say one in English. As you know the England must have consonants that harmonize and one that he

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:15.800
won a prize on in English was Lindy how well he landed in Paris though peril confronted. Gritty

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:25.320
Yank with great head away he went undaunted. I wish I could say some of them in the Welsh

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:34.320
because they sounded very musical even to my Canadian ears. When you visited Wales this year

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:43.320
for the first time what else impressed you about Wales and the Welsh way of life? We had the good

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:51.080
fortune to attend the command begone in Rosanus Grigogh and this gave us one of our biggest thrills

00:03:51.080 --> 00:04:02.160
and also to see the old churches and houses where dad lived where he went to church and some of the

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:11.800
farms that he trampled over looking after his Welsh sheep. We met many of my cousins too whom

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.280
I had never seen and one thing that really impressed me especially in the Kiriogh Valley

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:25.120
was the way everyone spoke Welsh and they would rather speak Welsh than English. Did you have a

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.080
chance to practice your Welsh there? Oh yes I had many opportunities and we are looking forward to

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:47.920
going back again as soon as possible possibly two years. Wednesday the 3rd of July in Ponoka.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:59.640
Now Mr. Hugh Roberts, do you remember the story of the chapel in Wood River when it started?

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:16.560
Yes, the chapel started in 1914. The Welsh church was open in Ponoka beyond the chapel in Wood River.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.160
delicious clouds

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.240

Ac recitations, solos a ddau llun cael eu canu.

I don't know if I can remember.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:16.240
Conductors of Calgary, Judicators rather, of Calgary.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:21.240
That's the one I think.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.240
Oh, 1950, 1950.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.240
Olafornu, yes.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:33.240
I was going to say that, but it doesn't get my voice.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.240
I thought to steer the trailer on cash,

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.240
I knew the cabal had the same grass.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.240
Go set the people on the ground,

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.240
keep the clothes on the ground.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.240
And say it all in the cabal,

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.240
common in the olifo.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.240
You people common, and free.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:51.240
Common in the olifo, the guys who work in the primary building.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.240
You say it all.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.240
I'm going to try that.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.240
Oh, right.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.240
Oh.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:03.240
I don't know what he's doing,

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.240
but he's making a noise in the car.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.240
He's going to turn the lights off.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.240
That's what I'm saying.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.240
Yeah.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.240
Thomas Hughes was born in 1906.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:21.240
In 1907, he was admitted to the Bans Hall.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.240
He was building a team,

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:27.240
and he was selling store at the butcher shop.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:33.240
And he was traveling around,

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.240
and he was a team of little guys,

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.240
and he was making cake,

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.240
and bread, groceries, candy, and pop.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.240
And he was making a lot of cake,

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.240
and he was a little old,

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.240
I remember,

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.240
but he was old,

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.240
and he was always in the hall.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:59.240
And he told one story about Thomas Hughes.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:03.240
Someone was picking nickels and dimes here,

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.240
on the floor.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.240
And when he was still here,

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:12.240
Thomas Hughes was watching the buggy,

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.240
and he saw a couple of them,

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.240
and he saw a crack in the buggy,

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.240
and he thought,

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.240
that's one way.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.240
But Thomas Hughes,

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.240
a lot of people thought of Thomas Hughes,

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.240
and he handed it to people at the time,

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.240
even though there was no store within 10 meters,

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:39.240
and only a few of us went there.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.240
And a lot of people came there

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.240
to buy groceries from Thomas Hughes.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.240
Thomas Hughes was a young man,

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.240
and he was a young man,

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.240
and he was a young man,

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.240
and he was a young man,

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.240
and he was a young man,

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:05.240
and he had a band of hope.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.240
And we were young,

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.240
and we had a band of hope.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.240
Thomas Hughes was so good at it,

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.240
and he had a lot of money,

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.240
and Thomas Hughes had a lot of money,

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.240
and he had a lot of money,

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:28.240
and he liked it.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.240
Jarvis Davis.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.240
I was a small boy going to church.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.240
Well, when the communion was passed,

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.240
it was passed by Thomas Hughes,

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.240
and he would have the wine first,

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.240
and then he'd pass it along,

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.240
and he'd sing one of the old hymns

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.240
that they used to sing for this ceremony.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.240
And anyway, I had heard that people having wine

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.240
was apt to get a bit gay once in a while,

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.240
and I said to Dad, I said,

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.240
Is he drunk, Dad?

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.240
I said, I'm not going to drink.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.240
I'm going to read very good books with Dad over that.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.240
Mrs. Hughes and Mrs. Thomas Jones

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.240
Mrs. Hughes and Mrs. Thomas Jones

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.240
came from Wales on the same boat

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.240
and also on the same train.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.240
And while traveling on the train,

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.240
she had put, she carried a picture of John Bunyan with her,

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.240
and while on the train,

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.240
and when she wanted to retrieve this picture,

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.240
she asked the trainman,

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.240
Will you reach me John Bunyan, please?

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.240
The trainman looked quite astonished.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.240
He couldn't figure out what it was all about.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.240
When we first came into the district here,

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.240
there was four Hugh Joneses.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.240
One we called Hugh D.,

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.240
the other Hugh T.,

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.240
the other Hugh H., and the other Hugh W.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.240
We never mentioned the Joneses,

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.240
there were so many Joneses in the district.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.240
The same thing pretty well applied to the William Joneses.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.240
We had William Reese Jones, we had William Jones,

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.240
we had William T. Jones,

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.240
and we called them Will T., Will Reese, and William Jones.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.240
We had to have a little respect for him because he was the older.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.240
You didn't give them any nicknames?

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.240
No, not really, just initials.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.240
We just used initials.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.240
Could you tell me some of the reasons why the Welsh people came to this area?

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.240
Well, I think mainly they came because of cheap land.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.240
We could get homesteads there.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.240
You paid $10 for a quarter section,

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.240
and you had to farm it.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.240
You had to live on it for three years.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.240
You had to produce it,

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.240
you had to live on it for three years,

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.240
you had to prove up on it.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.240
You had to cultivate 30 acres

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.240
and put $500 worth of improvements on it before you could get title.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.240
Another reason was that a lot of them had lived in the dry areas

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.240
of southern Alberta

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.240
and also many different parts of the United States.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.240
This was considered a wet area,

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.240
lots of timber, lots of water,

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.240
I don't know, other reasons, no doubt.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.240
Then after one Welsh family had came here,

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.240
naturally it attracted others.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.240
Their relatives and friends came here.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.240
That's about all I think.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.240
Who would you say was the first Welsh person to come to the area?

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.240
Well, I think mainly the people who came to the area

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.240
were the first people who came to the area.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.240
They were the first people who came to the area.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.240
Well, I think maybe Karl Morris might have been one of the very first ones.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.240
And Reverend D.L. Hughes,

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.240
a Welsh minister, came here in the very early days.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.240
When would that be?

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.240
About 1900 I would think.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.240
Most people seemed like,

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.240
what we call the early settlers,

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.240
seemed to settle in this area around 1900.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.240
And they were the first people to come to the area.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.240
And what we call the early settlers seemed to settle in this area around the turn of the century.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.240
No answer.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.240
No answer.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.240
1899, didn't they, 10 kids?

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.240
No, no.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.240
I thought he said that.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.240
And they made him the drake to be.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.240
He was the right drake.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.240
He was the right drake to be, down there with the men.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.240
Saying that there were Welsh people in the area,

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.240
and that was a nice view.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.240
Having read in the brief.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.240
And John Lewis was kind of real estate, wasn't he, Paul?

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.240
Yeah.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.240
And this.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.240
I remember Robert Jones,

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.240
because he worked on the telephone gang in 1912.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.240
We were, as children,

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.240
in Darlaniddh,

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.240
in the village of Tilla,

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:16.240
near Polion.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.240
And we started speaking Welsh.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.240
And we would sit there, and the woman would say,

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.240
Mom, there's someone there who speaks Welsh.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.240
And I remember, I thought,

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.240
maybe I should go to that village.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.240
The minute the crew went out,

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.240
that's where we were, down in the village.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.240
And that's from Tarlorn, Anglesey.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.240
I was born in Canada

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.240
on May 1927.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.240
29th of May 1927.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.240
And I was born on the 3rd of June.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.240
And I was born on the 3rd of June.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.240
I was a farmer

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.240
in Maymont, Saskatchewan.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.240
I was born in Camraig, in Bangor, Saskatchewan.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.240
I was born in Patagonians.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.240
I'm just a little bit older on the left.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.240
I'm from Amarillo, ancestors.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.240
I was working in Melville.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.240
And I was in Penoca

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.240
in March 1929.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.240
I was working there,

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.240
and whatever,

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.240
until the end of the 19th century.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.240
And then I...

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.240
West, what's the name of West?

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.240
Corcheawin. Corcheawin.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.240
And then I was born in Farr.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.240
And then, on the 10th of May,

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.240
I went to Renwlad.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.240
Well, it was a lot of new things.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.240
A lot of new things, I don't know,

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.240
but things were new at West.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.240
Well, prosperous.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.240
And I don't think it was new,

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.240
but it was new.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.240
And I was in the same place

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.240
when I was born,

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.240
on the 7th of July.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:19.240
You can't remember?

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.240
Yes. I remember that the other

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.240
depression started in 1942,

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.240
I think, at that time.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.240
And in the city of Penholden,

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.240
train station at the airport,

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.240
in Renwlad, Penholden,

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.240
40 miles from me, 10,000 miles up in Oca.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.240
And then, you know, at Falkhuis,

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.240
there was Thomas Hughes,

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.240
Robert Jones, Jeffreys,

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.240
and Amarillo, and I was there,

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.240
but they were looking for another one.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.240
It was for completion,

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.240
and that's when I came into the job.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.240
And I went to the school there,

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.240
but 500 miles away from me

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.240
on the same dot on my left—

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.240
quit that Wopeman,

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.240
well on this side,

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.240
it was like I was moving forward then.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:26.320
The word left, looked cardiovascular.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:33.200
They差élize a lot of radio stations.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.800
There were cameras.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.520
CS, CW, ..."c Camera.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.000
C River.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.080
Nóná proudhán.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.440
C dire.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.440
Jim Canada on all of us.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.440
That's in the command of our garden.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.440
Yeah.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.440
My daughter went right over here, she said.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.440
Garonnoy Davis of Penoefe.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:09.440
I even had a daughter by a mam in 1906.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.440
Nothing had.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:15.440
I had a daughter by a mam in 1907.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:21.440
There's a daughter by a mam in May 1907.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:29.440
My mam liked to go to the chapel.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.440
I knew a lot of the chapel.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:37.440
And she went to the chapel around there in the school.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:42.440
A little bit across the street.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:49.440
And from 1916 we built a new chapel.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.440
In the city.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:58.440
And the first pastor, I'm sure, was Jeffress.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.440
He was a little boy.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:07.440
And Mr. Jeffress was not a priest.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:14.440
And we built a chapel around the town.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:21.440
Well, I think I remember, in the year or two, last night, we built it.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:26.440
And it's a bit of a waste.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:31.440
We built a chapel from...

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:39.440
Well, a chapel from Wales.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:45.440
The chapel was built in Wales in 1921.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.440
Oh, it was 1920.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:55.440
And then after that, the chapel was in the middle of Wales and the middle of the city.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:00.440
But when I was a little boy, I went to Scotland.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.440
In the school, around there.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.440
And then in the chapel, then.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:11.440
And we were teaching at the road mam.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:19.440
And Tada and Mamma were teaching us in the school.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:26.440
And when we were growing up, we went to watch classes.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:34.440
And when we were in the 16th or 17th grade, we were in the adult class.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:42.440
And we were teaching Welsh in the school.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:48.440
And we had a Bible that was in Welsh, that was in English.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:27:06.440
And we had a lot of fun trying to get different interpretations of the Bible in Welsh and the Bible in Welsh.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:15.440
At the beginning of the school, the magic school, we couldn't speak Welsh.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:19.440
We couldn't speak English, we could only speak Welsh.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:28.440
And what we were teaching was through the school.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:33.440
And we were taught all three classes when we were little.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:39.440
The first year in the magic school.

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:46.440
And the magic school was around the whole of the children of Wales.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:53.440
Some of the different languages there, but Welsh was the most.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.440
It was magic for a couple of years.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:12.440
I have a lot of friends who went to school and went to school in the same school as me.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:20.440
Some of them were older.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:25.440
And the school was very different from the rest of the children.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:32.440
But talking about the school.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:42.440
We had a school here in the early 1900s to before 1910.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:47.440
And carried on for several years.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:56.440
Then it carried on until about 1925 or somewhere in that neighborhood.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:06.440
And then for a while we didn't have Stelwood again until the 1930s, the end of the 1930s.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:11.440
And then they petered out.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:22.440
And after about a lapse of 10, 15 years, we, descendants of the Welsh in Woodriver,

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:28.440
again started up the Stelwood, which is now called the Woodriver Festival.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:33.440
And we are carrying on to this day, which is an annual event.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:43.440
During the first festivals when I was a child, it consisted of music, elocution,

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:58.440
handiworks, such as making halters of things, cooking, and writing limericks.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:03.440
These were competitive festivals.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:08.440
And a lot of the singing was competitive.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:13.440
Classes were old and young, even for the ones over 50.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.440
Choirs were quite prominent.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:23.440
And at that time, nearly all the Welsh people could sing that were here.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:31.440
There were several quartets in one competition, and it was quite competitive.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:45.440
And some of the choirs that were in this community were led by some of the Welsh people that came over from Wales.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:50.440
And I think the tradition is still carrying on.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:56.440
The Welsh people are still able to sing, and the Welsh songs are quite close to the heart

00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:02.440
of most of the young people in the district at the present time.
