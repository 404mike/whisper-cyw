00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Now, Margaret, would you mind stating your full name and if you like date of birth?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Please for records.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
My full name?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Yes, Margaret McBreaty.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And I could say where and when were you born?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I was born in London.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
In? We all know when. 1933?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
1933.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Correct.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I don't know that.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Yeah, I know that because you just had a birthday.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Only a month ago, so.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Right. When did you first meet Paul Sartore?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Well, when he arrived in the parish.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Yeah.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You became aware that Father Coffey was quite elderly and he had Father Sartore as a curate.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Total different characters and type of person Father Coffey.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Gentle, very gentle man Father Coffey was.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
But getting on in years and quite traditional.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Father Sartore was totally different.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Full of fizz and things.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Charisma on the legs he was.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Fantastic man from that point of view.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It took years before I stopped going into town and expected him to come whizzing round the corner.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
He was such a personality.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Yeah.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And such a sort of person that had an effect on those who were totally not Catholic, even in some ways opposed to it.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:08.000
When we started doing door to door collections, I more than once had people say, oh, well, I don't really hold with the Catholics, but Father Sartore is a lovely man and they put money in the box.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
He had that effect on people.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
That's lovely.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Yeah.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So your earliest memory would have been just going to Mass as a parishioner and coming across him and then presumably you might have gotten to know him personally, but you've got to understand his character from his sermons and the way he walked.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
What was he like as a priest?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
What was he like at Mass sermon wise?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
He was very good because, sorry, I'm getting a cough.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.000
He had this sort of warmth and strong belief that came across very well.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I mean, all the priests have the belief, they must have, but they wouldn't be doing the job.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
But some of them are able to project this much more than others.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Rather than read a prepared sermon from a book, which we have sometimes.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So that's good.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Spontaneous.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Yes.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
That's good.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
What else can I ask you now?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So, how would you describe him?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
As you say, fizzing, full of energy.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Oh, yes, full of energy.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Run rather than walk.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
This is fizzing with life.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Yeah.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And did he have any impact on you personally or just, would you say, particularly?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Or I don't really know.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Well, yes, he did in a way because, sorry about this, when I first came across him,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I wasn't married, my husband to be lived down here.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And I used to come on, you can't do your courting over the telephone.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So I used to, they call my holidays in long weekends.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And because my husband had been married before, we had to, father put towards the door,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
he did come out and have a cup of tea with us and talk about it,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
about the possibilities of whether we could.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And he said, yes, it should be all right, but you have to go through the process.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So I was good with his advice.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Good, good, and it worked.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
What else are we going to say?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000
So more or less this is a little bit repetitive now, just trying to sum him up.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Oh, yes.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Trying to sum him up in a few words again.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
It's a little bit repetitive now.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Oh, well, I can suggest no.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So any stories, anything?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Carisperon legs.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
That's a good one, isn't it?

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I never heard of anybody not liking him.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
That's good.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
That's lovely.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Some had stronger feelings than others, but you know, as I say,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
either within the church or outside.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Amazing man he was.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And such a contrast to Father Coffee, who was more traditional.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Did they get on?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Sorry.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Did Father Coffee and Father Paul get on?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
What were they like as a?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
They learnt to live together.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Well put.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Yes, yes, they did.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I think they had respect for one another, but obviously totally different sort of personalities.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:58.000
But I think it was Father Paul must have said some one day that we get by, we get along.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
That's good.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Well, you're sharing the house, you've got to.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
You've got to, yes.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And then of course, you know, when Father Coffee got ill,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
then they made him a cannon, but they made Father Paul the parish priest

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
because of the work of the others.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And Father Coffee survived Father Paul, did he?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Not very long.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
No.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
No, no, no, no.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:35.000
He, Father Coffee had gone back to Ireland because he was ill.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And he came, he made great effort, and he came to Father Paul's funeral.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And while he was here, he got taken ill, taken into hospital.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And as far as I remember, I don't think he ever came out.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So it was a matter of weeks after Father Paul.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Yeah.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And what was the impact on the parish when they both died?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Well, yes, everybody was stunned, shocked, and waiting to find out what was going to happen.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Because Father Paul had been ill for some time.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
I remember that it was the last time I saw him, and he's actually in the parish.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And he said, and he had his big armchair by the altar, and he was sitting down most of the time.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
He threw up the concentration, and that was about it.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
But you knew by then that he wasn't?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Yes, everybody knew by then.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000
But...

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Not sure everybody, not sure I knew exactly how serious it was, but he was obviously very ill.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And did you know anything of his wishing to set up a hospice?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000
As far as I know, there was nothing to do at the time, but there was a group of people who had already started to discuss,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:09.000
or he had started discussing with them about some form of hospice in this area.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And I was told that at one point he said, well, you'd better hurry up, because I'm going to be your first patient.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
That's when he knew how ill he was.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And then after he died, it gave more incentive to the original committee to start setting things up, start fundraising and so on.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And that's really when I got involved, the beginning of the fundraising.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So in what way?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Well...

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
House to house?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Yes, I got taken on to the committee by you-know-who.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Oh no, shh, yes.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Yes, so we had a fundraising committee, and we started off taking our blue boxes around all the houses.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And some people would give you the odd pennies out of their pocket, and other people were very generous.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000
And as I said, some of them, they're old with the Catholics, but...

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
His reputation went before him.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
His personality had affected the whole area that they gave.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And we just went on collecting money in various ways, then the outside test goes rattling about.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
I did a little of that, but not much.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
In latter years, I was just saying, going round the houses.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
I didn't like it as a way of doing it.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
No, I didn't.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And they set up the shop, they had the shop then, and the green.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And then it snowballed.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Yes, gradually, as the whole idea of Pembrokeshire Hospice, if you like, as that began to grow in the community, and the money began to come in.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.000
So they could expand then, so you could have the shop, you could start having annual ball.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:24.000
All these things gradually grew out of all that, until you finish up with this.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
What we have today.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Yes, yes.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
That's great.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
About 40 years or something.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
That's excellent.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
That's covered it all, wasn't it?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Absolutely.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And got extra.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Yes.
