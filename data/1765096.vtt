00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
...interview by Dr. L.H. Thomas with W.E. Davis of Regina, September 1st, 1970.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
You see, they didn't have to go and live on the farm. They could stay at home.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But if they were over the 7-mile limits, they were already quite well-off.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
There's six months of the year. The other six months they would love to...

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Some of them went away to work in the bushes during the winter months, you know,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
to get some money to help themselves along, or went out to work on farms and so on.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
But they, again, they couldn't start working until they were 18.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That's the time they started to improve their homesets.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Then they received by the time, they said that three years to get their titles.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Then they'd be about 21, you see.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Get their titles on the land.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And when we came here, of course, all they were asking was to cultivate 30 acres in that three years.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
That's only just 10 acres a year, see, that was all that was required.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And there was no requirement for any buildings of any amount.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
But that's changed, of course, a lot since then.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
That's the way it was worked up then.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Yes, yes. Would you say that the first years, the first two or three or four years in the settlement

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
were particularly hard, tough for the migrants?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Well, no, I wouldn't say they were tough.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
No more so than for the settlers, generally.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Of course, the climate was, that was the thing that we had to get accustomed to, you see.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Yes.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Because there you don't get any lower than 30 or, although they had frost there,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and there too, you see, in the Argentine, when we were thinking frost there.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I can remember sleet there.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
We were there.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Were there any significant number of people who withdrew, who left the settlement

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and either went back to the Argentine or went into work in the towns, Winnipeg, shall we say?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Yes, some returned to Wales, and some returned back to Patagonia and all of that,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and others went to various places in Canada.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Yes.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Now, am I right in thinking that very few of the people spoke anything but Spanish and Welsh initially?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Were there just very few English speakers?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
There weren't very many.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
No.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
No, there were very few.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Of course, my mother was very fluent in English.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
She'd been teaching in Wales before coming out.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
She was very fluent.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Of course, her father, he didn't have any hard-earned education at all, you know,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
because he was half-dead before he was six.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And then there was, all he had was a little Welsh, but he had to work when he was very young.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Yes, I know what that means.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I gather that the settlers were anxious to establish schools promptly where the children could learn English quickly.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Is that your...?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Oh, yes.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.000
We were here, we came here in June 1902, and the Royal School Districts, number eight out of seven,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:15.000
it was open on the 4th of May, 1904, so we were practically almost two years before we had a school.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I can remember that very well.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I often wonder, you know, what the teachers of today would do.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.000
There were about 30 pupils there that morning, and you could count on one hand the number that understood English.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
The rest of them had no English at all.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
We had no English, but we were bilingual then.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
We could speak Spanish, I could speak Spanish.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
That's the rule, I think, and I speak English today when I first came out,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
but that's gone, I was too young to keep it up, you see.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
But we kept up the Welsh.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Well, that's the point I wanted to come at now.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
The Welsh was kept up relatively well.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Yes, for a good many years.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, just as it had been in the Argentine.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Oh, yes.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Yes.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000
But unlike the situation originally in the Argentine,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000
where the idea had really been to establish a separate Welsh state,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
that objective had long since been given up.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Oh, yes.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Yes.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I take it from what you say, Mr. Davies, then, that taking that settlement as a whole,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:46.000
that you could say that the success of the settlers was comparable to the success of settlers

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
of other origins in adjacent areas.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Oh, I would say so, yes.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Yes.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Yes.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
What about the situation when the first war broke out?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Were there many who enlisted and went overseas?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
A good number, a good number.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Yes, yes, yes.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And some of them are lying in France, and they were born in the Argentine.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Yes.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
They found their resting place in the first war.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Yes, yes.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:31.000
I'm sure this was true of many areas of the prairies where United Kingdom settlers established themselves.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Yes.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:49.000
The interwar years were, I suppose, similar due to other areas of Saskatchewan in terms of the relative success of farming.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000
You didn't have, in the 30s, the same drug conditions up there, did you?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:07.000
No, not in parts, we didn't have that severe, it was dry enough, of course, but it wasn't like some parts,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
south more to the southwest here.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Yes.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
We didn't have that.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Was the wheat pool an active factor in the community?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Yes.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:35.000
I guess I'm one of the few original ones that, I didn't know that people came there in 1923.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Of course, now I'm out of farming, I'm out of it altogether, but I'm certain there's not very many of them left in the community,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
you know, the younger generation.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Yes.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Well, now, that was another question that I was interested in.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:09.000
The children of the Welsh settlers have remained on the land, at least some of them, I take it,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and have taken over the family farm, or have they tended to move away?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Well, there's some of them still, but very few of them remain there on the farm.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
There are some, of course.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Yes.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Some have gone to various occupations in them.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Yes.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:51.000
What would your guesstimate be that 40 or 50 people of Welsh background now farming there, or more than that?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
No, I don't think there'd be more than that.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I suppose there was an effort in the early years to keep up the musical tradition of the Welsh.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Oh, yes, that was kept up.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:30.000
We had our singing festivals and we used to draw them from all parties to come there and just listen to the singing.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
We had our competitive festivals there for years.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Instead, we'd see that was held there for a good many years.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Oh, yes.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And then the Welsh Church was organized there in 1904.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Now, which denomination was that?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
It was the Calvinistic Methodist.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Not the Calvinistic Methodist, but as they are known today, the Presbyterians.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Ah, yes.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
There we are.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
In 1905, they became affiliated with a denomination in the United States.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And from there, we had help to keep a minister, and we were alone to build our church.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
We built the church in 1910.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Before that, we all had our services in the schools.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And there's another congregation that has their services in the school at the Glendul district,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
another five miles away, the other part of Welshmeadow.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Yes, indeed.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And did they succeed in getting Welsh clergymen in the early years?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Did I understand you to say that there was an Anglican church in the community?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Yes, there's an Anglican church. There's a St. David's Anglican church in Bangor.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And then there's the St. David's and St. Athelps in the Fluonan district.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I see.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And that's on the farm that my father bought.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
He bought a farm with a church situated there.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Well, now, I'm a little surprised at this because I tend to think of Welsh people as being nonconformist rather than Anglican.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
But some of them were Anglican, were they?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Well, very few of them.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:38.000
But the Anglicans, the Church of the English Seculars, were coming in.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
But they did have a Welsh service there for the Anglican church, too.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
A man came out there in 1906.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
I think it was Levenyver Jones.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And he was there in 1907 or 1908, I think, when he left.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And we didn't have a minister at that time.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And my oldest sister, she was the first marriage that took place in that St. Athelps church, with the servant Jones, Lyra Jones.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:27.000
He left there and he went to Prince Albert when he was in Denver for many years.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Well, tell me a bit about the centenary celebrations in Patagonia that you attended.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
That must have been quite a thrill for you.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Yes, it was quite a thrill, of course, going all that way.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Did you fly down?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Yes, we'd never been in a plane before.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And then the three sisters, my sister, my other sister, she was in the poor town, the state of Washington, USA.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
She wanted to go, but the doctor wouldn't.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
The minister said there's too long a journey.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And her husband, he was born out there, too, and he had a lot of problems.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
So he came with us, with the five of us.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000
He came here from Fort Thomas to Regina and joined us here and we went.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
We had quite a good time there.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And now I see there, of course, there's some there that's still remembered.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
There were quite a few of the children we used to go to school with.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Quite a few of them.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Yes, yes.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
We were playing a real rally.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
We had a banquet and all that.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
No admissions, we were just going on the buses, just walked on there.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Just a second and I'll get you a mic.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Yes, well that's a very nice medal, Mr. Davies.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Thanks for doing that.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And you must have enjoyed it.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
That picture is 105 years old.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Oh, my.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
That's my father.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Well?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
That's my grandmother and that's his brother.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
There's another one there, he died on the sea.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
I see, I see.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I have a picture, or a copy of a picture, of the 1865 settlers and also a picture taken on the ship bringing the group to Canada.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:37.000
I don't think that all of the people who came to Canada are in the picture, but quite a number are.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And I hope to reproduce these two pictures when I do this little article on the settlement.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:15:11.000
There was an interesting article written by Bryn Williams in the British Journal, the Geographical Journal on the Patagonian Welsh back in 1961 with a number of interesting photos in it.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Yes, I was surprised.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I went back and I met some of the, I knew there were children of the old settlers like my father was, you know, like I was.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
They were there and they said that he's got quite a few errors in his books.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And I said, well, how is that?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Because I said, I remember the old gentleman, his name was Richard Jones, but he took the name Berwyn after him.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:43.000
But there was another Jones there, and he was from that range of mountains, the Berwyn Mountains.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
He came from close, he took the name Berwyn.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
And we used to call him Berwyn, that's all of them.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And I remember him quite well.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And he used to be the recorder there and everything else.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And they said, well, those records were lost in the flood of 1905 after you left.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
And then there's nobody afterwards.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
And he's got most of this information, you see, from other people.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
And some of them had no connection with the first pioneers.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
So then they had one book here, it's not here now, my sister had it.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
And in that year, I know that one is an error.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:27.000
He's talking about the group that went up with Colonel Fontana to explore the country in 1885.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
And he said they were a group of young, single, romantic young men.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
They were married people among them.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
My father was amongst them, and he was married and had two children.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Is this the group that founded the settlement up in the foothills of the Andes?

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Yes, that's right, yes.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Do you know Richard Welland's novel, Up into the Singing Mountain?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
No, I haven't seen that book.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Well, it is a sequel to How Green Was My Valley.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Oh, yes.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:09.000
And it's a very good novel, and it's set in the Patagonian settlement.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:24.000
And the combination of it is the movement of this group up into that area,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:41.000
or at least the main character goes up with some others after the floods of, I guess, 1899.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
At the turn of the century.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
I remember that flood.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Yes, I'm sure you do.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Yes, I remember it quite well.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
I would have lost to that.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Where are the big pictures that you have taken?

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Well, get those others that I took. They'd be more interesting.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
I have a bit of this.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Just repeat, Mr. Davies, about the group who went down to the anniversary celebrations and the congregational singing.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Well, you see, there's a group of 72 there from Wales.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:34.000
And the editor of this journal, Elvis of the Rainbow, he was there.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000
And he's also the secretary of the union of the Welsh people in dispersion, as they're called.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
He's the secretary of that too. He was there.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:52.000
And the other thing, the leader was Dr. J. Alvin Davies, that, progressively, has since passed away.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
They were there. But the singing was there, of course, just as good as it had ever been in Wales.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Couldn't be any better.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Couldn't be any better.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
We had a real good time there.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:15.000
The Welsh people in that province are quite influential in the government, aren't they, of Patagonia?

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Yes, some of them. There was one of them, well, I knew his brother. His brother used to be in school with me.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
He was the minister of interior in Hayton Davies.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:31.000
And, incidentally, his mother was the first child born after they landed there.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
And she's born in these caves where they...

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
See, there's a rock there, they call it a tosca.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000
And it's very soft. If you've got a good nail, if you can carve your name on it.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.000
And they dug these caves in the rocks, and that's where they spent about...

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
I think they were there about six weeks before they started the journey into the valley.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Then they took some of the children by boat.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.000
These would take about two days to go by boat, then go up the Chubut River.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:13.000
And they were met with a storm, and they were lost at sea, and they were away for about two weeks before they landed.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:21.000
And they'd run out of water and out of provisions, so it was pretty hard on the children, you know?

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
I'm not sure whether Dad was amongst that group or not.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Whether he did go with them, or whether he walked with the rest of them.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Because I heard him talking quite a bit about them going across these sandy, rocky places, you know?

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
And about one man would put his stuff in the wheelbarrow, you know, and he'd stand up,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
and the whole thing was digging down into the sand.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
And he had to leave that and throw the things on his back and carry them there.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
He couldn't make any headway at all.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000
But there was loose gravel. I heard him talking about that, but I don't know for certain, you know, whether he went...

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Well, they established very good relations with the Indians, didn't they?

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Oh, yes, yes, thank you.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
And the Indians taught them how to hunt with the bola and the lasso.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
My father was an expert with his lasso and his bolas.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
And then there was another one, a short one, about a yard long, two little...

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
They used to get the rabbits and patties or anything like that.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
You see, a patties and then the sweet address, all that.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Just take the head, clean off.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Just drop right on the stone, you see, and it'd be dropped right there.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
But the head would be gone clean when you only want to...

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000
And when we first came out here, you see, your father and mother and sister, they went out to a farm.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
They were in the Crescent District to buy a cow.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
And they got this cow and the calf was out sucking, you see.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
And the old farmer says, well, we'll have to drive her into the barn, you see, to get this calf.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
And he told my sister, you stay there.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
And dad had his rope in his hand.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
We had no larry at the work.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
We just had an ordinary rope, you see.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
And this calf went by my sister all this good work.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
And the old man says, why'd you let that calf go?

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
And the next moment he saw the calf was lying down on the ground there.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
He caught it, you see.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
I saw the calf and he was lying down pulling and he was lying right down there.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
And the hired man on the field had caught it there.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
He says, come here, come here.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
He says, I want you to see what some of these new immigrants can do, is it?

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
He was crazy.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
And I laughed over that.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Then Mr. McNutt.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Well, I think I'm right in saying that he was the first speaker in the Saskatchewan Institute.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
I think he was the first.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000
I knew him quite well.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
I knew the son, too, Russell.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
I knew him, too, quite well.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:56.000
And he had a lot of cattle out, you know, and shares to the lair of 25 head of cattle.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Something like that.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Some of the young boys got them out and brought them out to the district there.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
And they got to a certain place where they were to meet.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000
And that one there, when he got there here, they were trying to get these cows into the barn, you know, to catch them.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
And he said, and then we got a rope.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
He'd taken some rope with him because he had two coming there.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
And they said, you ask, we have some rope here.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
I said, all right.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
So he started off and he was cutting a piece off every time.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
The last two to one, the cow cut a piece off.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
And till the end he wanted a short piece before he finished.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
But he cut them all for them.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Well, that's very interesting.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
He was very... and he could do braiding, you know, just...

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
He learned that.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
He braided anything with the leather, no matter how many strands you had or anything.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Because they did most of their own lair there, you see, their lair there, were leather.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
And they braided things, what they never tend to hide.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000
They just shaved the hair off, you know, and they braided them when they were real wet.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:09.000
And then after they got finished, they tied onto their saddle and then they put the horse on there to pull for all those words.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
And then after that they'd soak it in oil.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
They'd iron the ring on the end of it, you see.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.000
I saw one of them breaking too, just before we came here.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:31.000
The settlers weren't able, of course, to bring much in the way of property with them.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
There wasn't much room on the boat for them to bring.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
No, there wouldn't be much room.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
But what sort of things did they bring?

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:46.000
There was mostly household articles and life with articles.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
That?

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Well, we have no regrets of it.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Father said he had never no regrets of coming to Canada anyway.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Wow, that's interesting.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:13.000
See, the reason that he really left there was not so much the flooding, but the instability of the government.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Well, while we were there, I was introduced to the governor of the Chubut province, you see, my relative in land, in Chukwis.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
And then two or three days later he was out.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Yes, still goes on.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Still goes on. Yes, still goes on.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Yes, yes.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Well, of course, the Argentine government originally had pursued a more or less hands-off policy,

00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:02.000
had let the settlers carry on with their own schools, their own teachers, and really their own South government.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
That went on for ten years.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Ten years, that ended ten years.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:19.000
And then those little, bit by bit they came in, and then of course the schools went out and they had to take the Spanish, the national school.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
You had to go there until you were fourteen.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
But the Welsh people, they built a school there, that contributed to it before he came out here.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:37.000
And it was opened, I think, about 1912, a kind of a high school, to teach Welsh and English.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:48.000
And they had a teacher from Wales there, a Mr Edmunds, and his wife, he was a BSc, you know, and his wife was a BA, and they both taught in that school.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:57.000
And then there's two or three from the colony went back to Wales, where they then graduated from the University of Aberystwyth,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
and then went back and taught in that school, the English and the Welsh.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:10.000
But of course they got no support from the government for it, and eventually they got that the Welsh people couldn't keep it up.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
So that had to be closed.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
So a good number of them there today are child English in that colony today.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.000
My cousins there are all, they have got English, the Spanish and the Welsh.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.000
And the Welsh, because of this school, there's quite a number of them like that there.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000
And they're now, they're teaching the English in the schools there now too, you know.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
So that's going to be quite a help.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
That's the thing that they're starting to do there now.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Yes.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Well in the 1890s, as I understand it, another source of worry to, I take it particularly the mothers,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:08.000
of the young men who were getting to be of military age was that the boys would be in the Argentine Army with a lot of rough types.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Oh yes, yes, that was quite...

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
I look forward to that.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000
No, no.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Pleasure.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:21.000
And there was a battle which they used to tell on Sundays, you know, and that was very much a cancer.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
And they won out on that, they fought.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
They won out on that, that there was no drilling to be honest with you.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Yes, the president promised them.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Yes, they could go with that.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.000
And the Argentine national anthem, as he was in, unison.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:46.000
And in 1890, Rocca, he was the president then, he said he was going to visit this colony at the time.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:55.000
And there was an old... there he'd been a bandmaster and he was well known in music and a bard too.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
His name was William Jones, but there he was never known as William Jones.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
He was called the old band.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Everybody knew him as the old band.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
And he had a bardic and a musical named Guiney.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
There was this bardic in it.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:20.000
And he harmonized the national anthem, you see, for the voices, and he trained a choir to sing it by the time Rocca came down.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
And when he heard the singing he says, that's going to be it.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
And that's the one they were singing there when we were now back in the hundred years,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
was the harmonies of this old William Jones band, as they called it.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:37.000
That's the harmony that was sung there, played and sung there at the hundredth anniversary.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Yes.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000
He was, I should say, he was really a musician, all right?

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000
A natural musician.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Oh yes, but he'd been an old bandmaster, you know, in Wales and North Wales.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
He was from Fristina.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Yes, he was quite a... quite a...

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
He went under the name of Guiney.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:07.000
And on this harmonies, you see, it says that the harmony, the air is by so-and-so, and the harmony by Guiney.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Doesn't it? William Jones is by Guiney.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
His musical and bardic name, you see.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
Yes.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Well, that's very...

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
No, he was quite a character.
