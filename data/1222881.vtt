The Jewish Social Club was a really well run, a nice place to go. I can remember my mother

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:25.000
and father used to go probably three or four times a week. They'd walk over the bridge

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:35.200
and they were there. My mother used to go there. She was a brilliant pianist.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:46.200
Oh, your mother? Oh, my mother. Really? Oh, yeah. She was a... well, she was a clarinet.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:01:11.200
She was a concert pianist. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. She was a brilliant, brilliant

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:25.900
pianist. Also, another interesting thing, she was the first woman in Cardiff to hold

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:37.600
a driving licence in 1925. Now it passed a test. I don't think she had to then. No.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:51.400
I don't think she had to. But her father bought a car and he never drove. She was the only

00:01:51.400 --> 00:02:00.200
one who drove the car. And then the war came along. And what were you going to do with

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:13.800
the car? They sold it for £100 to Jack Silver. And he saved all those cars. He had the big

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:29.400
garage in Carbridge Road. And at the end of the war, if he had money, he had 100 cars.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.000
They were worth... the worst of them was probably worth £1,000 because you couldn't get a car

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.900
for £1100 of money.
