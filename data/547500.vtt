00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Second Song

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.440
Hail, Hail, my Fatherland, Hail, O God, our Fatherland,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:47.760
I come for thee, O my trail, Come and reach the land of hell.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:58.760
Hail, hail, O my Fatherland, Hail, Hail, my Fatherland,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.760
Let's stand up and in English, sing all the Mark the Herald.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:14.760
Mark the Herald, angels sing, Glory to the newborn King,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:23.760
Peace on earth and mercy mild, God and sin his reconciled,

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:33.760
Join the holy nations rise, Join the triumph of the skies,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:42.760
Hail, Hail, my Fatherland, Hail, Hail, my Fatherland,

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:52.760
Mark the Herald, angels sing, Glory to the newborn King.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.760
The first word is c'luh, c'luh, after that it gets easy.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.760
Here we go everybody in Welsh.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:08.760
C'luh la chun, Some time ago a living, a living man,

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:17.760
Every day, every week a soldier is still my friend,
