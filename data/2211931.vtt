WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
So why don't we start with the museum?

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.560
Can you remember what did you see in the museum and what did it remind you of?

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:14.240
Yeah, when we came to the museum and we went upstairs,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.840
we saw the lady was doing the wool and knitting.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.560
So this is reminded me from my childhood.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:32.320
So when we were in the school, we finished the school, our uncle used,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:39.040
when we come back from the school, our uncle said sit down and start doing the knitting

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.440
and do the baskets and the mat,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.080
sitting mats, we have to make it.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.080
So we have to climb all the way because we have lots of date tree very long.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.080
So we somebody have to climb and take it out the leaves because the leaves is very strong.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:14.960
And we do the, I don't know what you call for, you know, you do.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.800
Knitting or weaving?

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.000
Weaving, I think.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.960
Yeah. So we have to make it one by one.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.200
Like you do with the hair, plaiting, plaiting, sorry.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.440
We have to do that one and make it one by one and attach to each other.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.240
But it takes us a whole day to make one.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:54.080
And then we, when we finish this one, go back home and then study for one hour.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.600
And then tomorrow early morning, we have to again wake up.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.800
So we didn't have chance to play or speak friends or something like that.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:15.760
But it was reminded me of my childhood, how we was working hard for little things.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.240
So it's really nice when I went over in the museum.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.560
And also when we went around and see different clothes.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:43.200
So we used to have the small, we sit down like with my auntie, mother, my sisters.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:57.440
And they, the person bring us like clothes where you have to do the designs.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.680
Immortary.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.160
So he bring small, small bits, different colors, and he give us the design.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.000
So we have to do this one.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.920
It take us like two weeks to finish whole dress.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.400
Somebody bring their weddings.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.400
Somebody bring their traditional dress to do it.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:28.480
But we have to put it in the wooden, square wooden.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:37.520
Have to put that clothes in and then we have to, that material and then we do the sewing.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.640
Yeah.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.800
So it's really remind me lots of things when I came to the museum.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.120
So the baskets and the mats.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.360
Yeah.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.840
What are the, what's the traditional word for that in your language?

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.680
It's, and you're speaking Arabic?

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.080
Arabic.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.320
Yeah.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.360
What's the word in Arabic?

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.760
The mat called Sijada and the basket called Silla in Arabic.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.880
Were they, were you, was your uncle making them?

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.800
Why was he making them and why were you making them?

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.000
Was it to sell them?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.320
Yeah, to sell them and get some money from it.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.560
Yeah.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.680
And also we have something called Fokhar.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.960
Fokhar.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.920
It's with the, we make it with the,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.520
you know when you make with your hand,

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.360
like a vase and cups.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.840
Mud.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.320
Clay?

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.640
Clay.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.120
We used to sit down and make that one.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.320
Okay.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.120
Also to sell?

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.040
Also to sell, yeah.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.360
So he have a like in the road, he sit down and sell this kind of things.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.720
So we have, we used to help him all the time to do the, with the clay maker,

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.680
the cups, plates and also we make the pot to cook the food.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.320
When you cook this food in this pot, which we make it with our hand,

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.440
it makes really delicious food and you can feel that deliciousness and

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.360
when it cooked inside it, you,

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.200
food is different.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.160
You cannot taste this kind of food anywhere else.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.200
Yeah.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.640
So he had lots of, lots of skills, dressmaking.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.780
Yeah.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:57.280
We used to do this, like a woman used to do the clothes making, the knitting ones.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:10.640
And with my uncles, we used to do the clay ones, make it and also the baskets and the mats.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.340
Yeah.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.960
So you said you were working hard.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.000
Yeah.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.640
Yeah. And because you weren't very, very old.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.760
No.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:25.600
Can you tell me a bit more about how old you were, who you were doing it with and how it felt to do

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.280
handicrafts?

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:38.160
We were around eight to nine years old and sit with my uncles and we used to

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:47.600
make it, but it feels like when I see my friends, they are playing, they call me and they say,

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.040
come we can play, but we was like, you know, forced to do something.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.800
So it's really hard.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:03.280
Our hands used to pain and even we tell them, they say, no, you have to do it because if we

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:11.920
don't do it from where we can get money or how we survive, you know, so we used to help and do

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.720
the things they say us to do.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.400
Was that normal for children to be working like that?

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:30.880
Not all. Some of them. Other of my friends, they didn't force, but our situation maybe was

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:36.320
difficult and hard, so we have to do to help them.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.840
So was there anything else at the museum? You said it was the lady spinning the wool

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.520
or was it the weaving that reminded you of the basket weaving?

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:48.960
Basket weaving.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.280
But which object was it that you saw that reminded you of that?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.560
The one she was, like a wheel and she was doing in the, her

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:13.920
tie. She was doing it, so it's reminded because we got lots of sheep, animals, so we do have to

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:29.120
cut their skin, the wool, and bring it and then we give it. So they teach us how to do, help them.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:37.280
So you would do the thigh ones. Can you tell me a bit more about how you would make the yarn

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.040
and then what you would do with it?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.120
They make it, they do it with the tie, but make it,

00:08:53.200 --> 00:09:00.400
so they do it with their tie, make it very thin so they can then use it for the sewing as well

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.440
for the clothing and doing other stuff with it.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.880
So you would use that to sew on the clothes?

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.440
Yes.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.440
Would you also knit with it?

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:22.080
Knit, we do it, but that will be like our mother, they knit the clothes like my mother,

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:34.080
she make for my son a hat and she send it over, so all three of my children, they share it.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.640
And they wear the hats.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.840
I remember them telling you about that on the day, they were very sweet.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.320
They were very excited and happy to tell you their story.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.280
So I think in future it's something to think about if we can do it with the kids.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:03.840
And also you know with the hat, the Arab people wear it, so we do sew that one as well,

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:14.720
but it will be like designs and it will be holes, so you just take the needle and sew it,

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.520
but different, different color. It will be like in the paper, in the picture they show you,

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.640
and you have to do that.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.200
So this one, the main whale that had, yeah.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.040
Were you making those when you were younger too?

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.540
Yeah.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.200
Yeah.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.700
Is there anything else you'd like to tell me about the museum trip,

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.700
things you saw, things you were reminded of?

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:48.100
The museum have reminded a lot of things, like you know the wooden design of it,

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:54.820
so it reminds us like our houses was like you know, big space,

00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:05.700
and all the things, most of the things over there like a blanket, old blankets, yeah.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:15.620
They reminded us of our childhood where we was doing it and sleeping on it, yeah.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.660
Thank you very much that we've been there.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:30.900
It's really interesting to hear that it was so impactful, and I know it was a long journey.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:36.980
Long journey, yeah. I told one of my friends as well, she was really excited, she wanted to come

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:44.340
and see the museum when I told her it reminded my back home and what we used to do with it,

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.340
and it reminded me good things and bad as well.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:56.580
So how we, it was good like we was as a family doing everything, I was with my family, but

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:06.820
now I'm here by myself, so it's a bit, you know, you remember those things, yeah.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.180
It's both happy and painful, isn't it?

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.620
Yes, it is.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:12.900
Happy to have those memories.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:19.220
Memories, yeah, but it is a little bit struggle life, you know.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.420
Do you mean when you were younger it was?

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:33.380
It was hard, it was very hard. I don't want my, I want my children to learn this kind of thing,

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.780
but not forced to do something.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.220
Yeah, yeah.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:46.660
It wasn't like for us easy, it's like from ourself we wanted to learn to do some. Now my children,

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:51.940
if they wanted they will say, oh mom, can we do that? Can we help you in the cooking? But

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:58.260
for us it wasn't like we wanted, it was all by force, you have to

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:06.660
do this thing, so it was really hard because during whole week we have to do that.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:12.340
It's like if we get time even for the studies it will be in the night time,

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.660
and again from morning we will start doing the same thing.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:22.260
Did you also have to work before school or did you always do it after school?

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:31.060
Because schools start from seven o'clock in the morning, so when we, they wake us from the prayer

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:36.900
then we sit down and whatever we can help with the cooking and everything, breakfast.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.380
And then school all day.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:43.860
School all day and when we come back from the school straight away we do help.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.500
That's a lot isn't it?

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.000
A lot.

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:55.540
Is there anything else you'd like to tell me about the museum,

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.740
what you saw and the memories you had, anything else?

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.500
Only those memories, yeah.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.740
How much money would you get for a basket or a mat?

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:17.460
No because my uncle, he take it so we just help him to get there.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.900
Thank you for sharing those stories about the museum.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:27.460
So now I know you have to go soon but I wondered if you wanted to do a little bit

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:32.100
of the interview, just 10 minutes maybe whilst you're here.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.220
Okay no problem.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:37.300
So you've told, one of my questions was about your childhood but you've told me quite a bit about

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.340
your childhood. Is there anything else about your childhood you'd like to share?

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:52.020
My childhood was really difficult because we do have to like work and then we do have to,

00:14:52.980 --> 00:15:04.900
we can't get what we wanted and if we dress up always we have to be long, proper so it wasn't

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:13.860
like free freedom what you get it, no. But we have to do everything strictly, listen,

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:18.820
listen in a way if not then we will be banned.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:26.980
We cannot only do works only, nothing we can do.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.460
Is there anything else about your childhood you'd like to share?

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.180
You said you were in, you did go to school?

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:48.020
Yeah we used to go to the school, come back but when I see my friends they play, they have to,

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:51.460
they can do something but in the play time I have to do my homeworks

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:58.980
because I don't have time later on to do anything, my homework or anything like that.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:07.700
So it was always I remember I have to cry and it's really hard yeah.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:12.740
I don't want my children to do or suffer.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.060
So can you tell me a bit about your experience of coming to Wales?

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.220
Again it doesn't have to be anything you don't want to share.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.940
When I came to Wales like

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:34.500
everyone when they go somewhere they are excited to

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:42.580
go somewhere new, get some new things, see different.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:50.500
And it was very welcoming when we came to Wales. It was

00:16:52.100 --> 00:17:01.060
people guided us where to go, what to do and helped us and lots of communities are there

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:11.140
to support and advise you. And I really like felt Wales is like a home to me and

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:20.740
I was happy because lots of different people from different communities and they

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.860
people from different communities and they

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:33.860
come together and celebrate the things and we meet up sometimes we do some cooking

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:40.340
like lots of activities Wales have for us to do keep us busy.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.260
How long have you been here? Around nine years.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:45.240
Yeah.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:54.500
Has your relationship with Wales changed at all in those nine years or do you feel the same as

00:17:54.500 --> 00:18:10.820
you did when you came? I got like a strong relationship because it's been like been long

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:22.180
time and it gives me lots of positive energies and also help develop my skills

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:31.540
and empower me to do something help me with the to move

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:39.300
move forward see new things build new things

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:48.340
like I went in the front not in the back yeah so I'm very happy for that yeah.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:56.660
I was wondering if you can tell me what home the idea of home means to you?

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:08.820
Home is where I feel safe comfortable and happy with my family

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:25.860
where I can trust and be there like ensure myself I'm nothing happened to me I'm safe.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:38.020
This is what I feel a home is and we're always think about the positive things not a negative

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:48.900
and always think about the future going to be better rather than I think no something bad will

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:59.220
happen. Can you describe a place or time or moment in your life that's important to you?

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:17.060
The moment when my child was child born so I was alone in the hospital and I was very scared

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:28.260
because I didn't know that much language and the lady was delivered to me

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:37.860
I don't know I didn't feel very comfortable I was so scared I thought like I was crying crying

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:49.700
but when the doctor came so when he saw my situation he said what happened what is wrong

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:56.420
I was scared to tell him with this lady I don't know I didn't feel comfortable so

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:06.900
he changed the midwife for me I was so surprised that he done that for me

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:14.660
that moment and that thing I never forget that even I'm from another place

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.420
they done something for me you know

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:47.700
so I felt that yeah this is my home they they did listen understand my thing yeah

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:48.980
yeah

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.220
I'm glad to hear you felt listened to thank you

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.300
sounds like that was very meaningful for you yeah

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:13.620
because he they did understand you know I was really happy because this was my first child I

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:21.540
was alone no family nothing and they just asked me why you are not comfortable for what reason

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:28.420
so when I told the reason they straight away changed and I was surprised that they can do

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:39.940
for me and I'm not belong to their country so it was something shocking and something you know

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:47.940
I'm also excited I was very very like I cannot describe what

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:54.580
they done for me like I was very happy that time yeah

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.780
this is the moment I cannot forget

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:02.760
it.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:09.780
Wow thank you for sharing that and that's you know it sounds like that was very very very meaningful

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:13.300
to you yeah yeah

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:21.940
I wonder if you could tell me a bit about I know we have to finish soon your hopes for the future

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:33.060
yeah my hope in the future I always like to help people who whoever come new here they don't know

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:46.340
so I do help them to whatever I can help like one of lady she's suffering she she got

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:52.980
divorced from her husband she's crying all the time she needs somebody to listen so I always

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:59.700
there for her and help her she wanted to her children to change the school she moved out

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:10.100
somewhere else so I did help her take her to places where she can get help as well so like

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:21.460
Welles teach gave me lots of good lessons to teach others so I'm really happy and proud of it yeah.

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:28.900
Could you tell me a bit more about what have been those experiences or opportunities that have

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:36.500
helped you to get more confident is it that you've had some training or education or just experiences

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:46.740
like Bawzu Bawzu supported us a lot with courses to like time management and

00:24:52.100 --> 00:25:01.860
get confident ourselves they teach us like we can do something we are able

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:08.660
is because before we just listening you can't do this you can't do that this is what but

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:19.140
when we are here now we have that ability that we can say yes I can do something or I can share

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:28.660
something or we was just scared you know can't do anything somebody have to be with us no

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:39.300
now even we are alone but we can manage everything by ourselves we can also advise others and help

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:51.860
them what they can able to do yeah you're experts in your experience now yes this is what wells teach

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.860
us so I'm really happy

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:03.540
I know you have to go soon but I wonder if there's anything else you'd like to share or that you feel

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:08.420
is important for us to know about about you in your life and your story I just

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:18.740
advise everyone to be strong and do what you want to do don't think that everyone have their own

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:27.540
ability and skills to do something but they skate like English language is the barrier for

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:37.540
them to do something but but here they are helping with courses and supporting women so

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:43.780
they can do so I just encourage them to do something rather than sitting that's why

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:51.860
we go to the groups where they can teach sewing they can learn with it and IT for the women

00:26:52.980 --> 00:27:01.300
so we do that yeah do you have any other hopes for the future of what you'd like like to do

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:10.100
for the future I want to be like do something for the ladies who cannot able to

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:21.060
do anything you know so we do some like run communities or help them to improve

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.300
and get confident that they can do something

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:31.940
is there anything else you'd like to share I know it's 10-2 now you have to leave but

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.940
I know it's okay thank you so much
