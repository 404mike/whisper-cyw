In 1870, the bakery at the Andrews' house on the corner of Wesley Street and Commercial Street became Lanteritt Major's first post office.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
William Andrews, son of baker Thomas Andrews, took over the running of the post office.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:35.000
In 1899, a manual telephone exchange was added. His son, Hughie, took over the running of the post office and the telephone exchange until he retired in 1941,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
thus ending a 70-year link with the Andrews' family and the post office.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The post office was transferred to No. 12 Wine Street. The manual exchange remained at the Andrews' house until it became an automatic exchange

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and transferred to a wooden building near to the railway bridge on Lanmace Road on 4 December 1962.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It was rumoured that the manual exchange in 1936 knew about the forthcoming abdication of Edward VIII long before the official announcement on Thursday 10 December 1936.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Hughie Andrews contributed greatly to the history of Lanteritt Major through his skills and enthusiasm as a photographer.
