00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The first time I went back was sort of necessity because I had to establish something.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You know, there were reparations paid, which in my case were not, were just the basic amount for loss of parents.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But I had to go back to establish that.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And that was the first time and that was in, I think in 1960 something.
