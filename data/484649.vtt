00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.160
This is Katherine McShane interviewing for the Swicker Carnival project, Cardiff Carnival's

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:19.360
25th anniversary heritage project and I'm here with Bud Harper on the 16th of October 2014

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:28.720
and we're and the time is 25 past 10 in the evening and we're in Peniland Cardiff. Bud,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.680
could you spell your name for us? Oh right okay yeah Bud and then my surname H-A-R-P-E-R.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.240
Brilliant. So obviously this is a carnival project, how did you get involved in the

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:49.840
carnival? Ah my older brother, I had an older brother and yeah it must be one summer he just said

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.040
come and get involved come come to this place come to Tays Community Centre.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.240
Um don't yeah I don't really reckon that I just remember being taken along there.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:07.840
I can't remember whether I really knew anybody else there. I just went along with him and quickly.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:17.520
How old were you then? So if it was 94, I think is the first one that I did, I would have been 19.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:25.120
Yes I actually that surprises me because I felt I've looking back I felt like I was really young.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:34.640
Yeah but it must be 94. So I started because it was yeah it was definitely Tays. I was quite shy.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.880
I remember there was lots of you know it was for Tays you know it was just people making costumes

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.840
every day and that you know you'd come in there was food. I don't know whether I remember going

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.440
to you know the opening night because I do remember from that period that opening night was quite

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.120
special that you know that was definitely the following year is that you'd make sure that you

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.520
were down there for the opening night. There was always lots of nice food, it was a good kind of

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.680
party atmosphere. And so what do you remember about that first carnival then you were involved in?

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:19.200
It's all the characters and yeah just lots and lots of different people and just you know it was

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:29.120
very big it was always seem very busy. It was a real hive of activity and I suppose at that age

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:37.040
where you know I was really it was a real introduction to kind of the adult world it felt like and

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.880
to quite a creative world so there were lots of musicians, lots of percussion,

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.560
lots of people making things you know it felt very creative and a bit anarchic.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.920
Yeah certainly you know you might come in on a Saturday and there'd just be people everywhere

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.760
in all different ages you know there were definitely some people. I suppose it was always

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:13.680
quite interesting most people felt older than me but there were other young people there and you

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.640
would kind of check each other out. I was quite shy at that age.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.560
Okay but you carried on going year after year? Yeah and it was the same you know certainly for

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.560
the first couple years that you know you'd go back the next year and you'd see people that you'd

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:43.040
seen the year before and over the years you'd make more of an effort I think to build you know

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.240
after three years you'd even if you hadn't talked to some of those people that the next year you'd

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.320
come back you'd they were like people you did know even though if you hadn't spoken to them

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.760
so you'd make a bit more you know nice to see you again.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.560
But yeah just characters you know obviously there was Steve was always at the forefront.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.520
Of course. Yeah you know it was interesting even when I was quite young

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.600
you know you could work you know you became aware of who was working there. It was you know like a

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.800
little hierarchy you know and but which people were always there even if they were volunteers

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.120
you know there were some yeah people who were just like star warts of I don't know even

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:38.560
necessarily know their names but just people you would recognize you might see them other

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.280
places I suppose during the year as well. Is there anyone you do remember particularly?

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:51.440
Yeah I think when I first started going down at Tom and Ali were quite big characters

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.440
because I was musical when I started so I was always keen to get involved in the music side

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:07.600
stuff and you know I was learning instruments myself but actually that whole thing of collective

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.680
drumming was really interesting and new and it was I suppose it was around the time as well of

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.480
you know kind of rave and stuff so kind of percussion and drumming and

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:26.320
that kind of tribal stuff and yeah a couple of years we I can't remember if we played along to

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:33.440
other stuff but we were all quite into our younger age group you know we're very kind of affected by

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.600
that kind of rave culture and I think we brought on actually we brought along quite a youthful

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.440
exuberance to some of the older ones you know I think we did bring something to the party at

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:52.720
the time it felt like we were quite you know up for doing you know yeah brought a lot of enthusiasm

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.280
but yeah the two things I suppose that you remember was one was you know every year getting

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.280
involved in the drumming and you know it was different every year you'd have a different

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:10.480
thing going on different people organizing it different kind of themes as such so yeah some

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.880
years it we did more strict kind of samba-y stuff that I know I particularly remember the one year

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:24.000
with Tom where it was just all rusty bits of metal and that was really and we had some ridiculous

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.720
float you know that was it was like a gosh yeah I remember people welding you know we

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:39.280
they built like a big metal construction was it the car yeah and when I see these people are John

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:48.320
I don't know I can't even remember his name punk John who used to go out with Anne for years

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.880
for years he was in he was always in Newport punk bands I can't remember

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.560
yeah I know him for you know it's funny that having known him for years later that was the

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.840
first time I ever met him it's funny to think gosh yeah I forgot that they did carnival

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.480
but that was yeah brilliant that was really anarchic I think I drummed

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:17.200
my drum that year was an exhaust exhaust off something and I just made a horrible noise

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:24.400
and I just beat it incessantly but yeah so the other thing then was the costumes that you made

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:32.400
and I think obviously looking back at the early my early days of doing carnival that it's quite

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:40.880
easy to remember those as being the best the best ones but I think actually what was what I really

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:50.640
did like about those in in relation to making costumes it was it was a bit more freedom to make

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:58.880
what you what you liked so you were you know you had to make your own costume which I think in

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:05.440
later years it became a little bit more synchronized and you had people making costumes for you and you

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:12.320
could kind of I was definitely in later years I was someone due to commitments that I could turn

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.760
up quite late into carnival you know a couple of days beforehand and pick up a drum and and

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:23.920
somebody would have made a costume for me and I think you miss out a little bit I mean I think

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.160
that's what you need a bit for everybody isn't it and some people that's all they can commit to

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.360
but yeah the first couple of years like we just used to make the most ridiculous costumes as well

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.160
what kind of what sort of things did you dress up as then well you couldn't really call them

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:43.920
anything the the one I dressed up it was it I mean there wasn't a theme so you could just dress up

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:50.960
there was just a load of materials and things but you could do what you like um the one year

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:56.640
there was loads of foam I don't know where it came from or what it was being used for

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.040
but I don't think it was specifically to be how a costume made and I

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.320
I was always rubbish at making costumes I was I was quite well known for my poor costumes

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.280
oh that was the stuff the thing was I was never I was never very good at making things and

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:26.080
I always my abiding memory of early years of costumes was with the willow you know not

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:34.160
curly willow but that wicker kind of bendy withy yeah thin bits of wood and that everybody had to

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.080
make stuff you know that was what you made you know I understand that you make all the frames

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:46.000
out of that stuff but that was and I never got on with that stuff so I didn't make I didn't want to

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:57.520
make stuff it was a real hive of activity and I suppose at that age where you know I was

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:05.360
really it was a real introduction to kind of the adult world it felt like and and to quite a creative

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:12.240
world so there were lots of musicians lots of percussion lots of people making things

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.680
you know it felt very creative and a bit anarchic

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:25.040
yeah certainly you know you might come in on a saturday and there'd just be people everywhere

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.880
in all different ages you know there were definitely some people I suppose it was always

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:40.800
quite interesting most people felt older than me but there were other young people there and you

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:47.760
would kind of check each other out so you would I was quite I was quite shy at that age

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:55.520
okay but you carried on going oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and it was the same you know certainly

00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:01.360
for the first couple years that you know you'd go back the next year and you'd see people that

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:07.520
you've seen the year before and over the years you'd make more of a an effort I think to

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:13.600
to build you know after three years you even if you hadn't talked to some of those people that

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:20.480
the next year you'd come back you'd they were like people you did know even though if you hadn't

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:27.360
spoken to them so you'd make a bit more you know nice to see you again but yeah just characters

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:35.200
you know obviously there was Steve was always at the forefront of course and just yeah you know it

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:41.760
was it was interesting even when I was quite young you know you you could work you know you

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:48.720
you became aware of who was working there it was you know like a little hierarchy you know and

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.640
but which people were always there even if they were volunteers you know there were some

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:59.520
yeah people who were just like stalwarts of I don't know even necessarily know their names

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:05.760
but just people you would recognize you might see them other places I suppose during the year as

and things but you could do what you like the one year there was loads of foam I don't know where

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:26.720

that was the stuff the thing was I was never I was never very good at making things and

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:53.520
my abiding memory of early years of costumes was with the willow you know curtain not curly

00:16:53.520 --> 00:17:01.520
willow but that wicker kind of bendy withy yeah thin bits of wood and that everybody had to make

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.440
stuff you know that was what you made you know I understand that you make all the frames out of

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:13.440
that stuff but that was and I never got on with that stuff so I didn't make I didn't want to make

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:22.880
stuff so what did you make from it so yeah they were these really large chunks of foam it was

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:32.000
like they'd been ripped out of like a seating or something I just uh I can't even I've got a pair

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:39.040
of scissors maybe just hollowed out a great big cube of stuff and just stuck it on my head

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:45.520
it was just like the most misshapen it wasn't anything in particular it just seemed kind of

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:50.960
I thought it I didn't even think it was funny I just thought I'd be cool so I had a bit I suppose

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:58.560
a little bit look a bit like spongebob just this great big yeah yeah just a huge bit of foam and I

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:04.880
think it was a bit of an odd shape it maybe looked a bit like an anvil and I just hollowed

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:12.800
out a bit so I could see out of it and breathe yeah I vaguely remember it used to yeah it rubbed
