00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600
Did the coverage affect, do you think, your feelings of being Welsh or of Welshness?

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:21.840
Well it certainly, I mean we've had many, many worse disasters since, haven't we, you know?

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:31.200
But you see these, these were like family, you know? I mean you're not, you're not,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:38.320
we're not talking about Russians or now today Japanese, you weren't talking about,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:46.800
you were talking about people like yourselves. Children were like the children who lived in the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.480
street, you know? I mean that's why it was, it affected, affected us so much I think.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.200
The numbers were terrific because if, if I remember, I remember somebody saying that

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:11.040
this was the first time that anything of this, of this scale had been televised, you see?

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:19.600
Because television, it was still comparatively new, wasn't it, you know? So this was bringing it

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:28.000
into the home, you know? All right, you might have read news of some other disaster in the newspaper,

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.480
but those were black and white things, you know, that you were reading. But this was coming to

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:42.320
our homes, you know? And as I say, the fact that it was people, like, like the people who live in

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.880
our street made it ten times worse, I think, you know?
