00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Weather Without by Dominic Newman

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Surely little will outlast West Welsh houses, They hold fast in the western weather's blast.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
When the wet Welsh wind is big, Mast or trunk, like straw or twig,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
West Welsh houses only dig Hewn heels further into hills.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Western weather finds and fills every crevice, Gusts like drills, deafen heaven, beaches teem,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Waves maraud and woodlands scream.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:53.000
In foundation, wall and beam, West Welsh houses, though, are made firm against the rainstorm's raid,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Stout of hearth and finely laid down in stone That shall not fail, hail of gable in a gale,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Storch in every joint and nail.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Rows and rows are sworn to guard West Welsh hearts against the hard rain,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
However swayed and scarred.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Snuggly purged along the steep western hillsides, Each shall keep stories, music, breath and sleep,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Safe and sound for years on end.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Side by side, they shall defend West Welsh souls and will not bend.
