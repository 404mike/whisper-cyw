00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Yn y ddiddor rydyn ni'n siarad, Pat, am eich gweithio ar y Loteri a'r RSW.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Roeddwn i'n siarad am y dyddiau yma.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Roeddwn i'n siarad am y dyddiau yma.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Felly, roeddwn yn amlwg am ddysgu'r llwyf hwnnw yma.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Roeddwn i'n siarad am y dyddiau yma, roeddwn yn ymwneud â'r bobl, neu byddwn yn siarad am bobl, a byddwn yn gweithio i'r llwyf hwnnw.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Beth o bobl?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Roeddwn yn ymwneud â'r llwyf hwnnw, er mwyn i gyd yn y tîm hwnnw, ac fel roeddwn i'n dweud, roeddwn yn siarad am y dyddiau yma, felly byddwn yn gallu gwneud y gwybodaeth hwnnw, pan oedd yn ymwneud â'r llwyf hwnnw.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Gallwch chi ddod hynny? Nid oedd yn gweithio, oherwydd y byddwch chi wedi'i gysylltu.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Roeddwn yn ymwneud â'r llwyf hwnnw, er mwyn i gyd yn y tîm hwnnw.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Roeddwn yn gweithio'n dda i'w ddod hynny, ond roeddwn yn dda i'w ddod hynny.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Ond rydych chi'n person sy'n bwysig iawn i chi.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Felly, sut ydych chi'n credu bod pobl eraill neu phobl eraill a ddod oedd yn bwysig iawn i chi?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Rhywbeth.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
roedd hi'n un o'i hun.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Roedd nhw'n mynd i ni yn y ffordd, oherwydd pan roedd hi a fi'n gyd-diddordeb,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
roeddwn yn gwych i gyd-diddordeb yng nghymru.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Ond nid oes unrhyw problem oherwydd y gallwch chi gyd-diddordeb,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
oes yw, yw, y gallwch chi gyd-diddordeb?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Yn oherwydd, roedd hi'n mynd i chi yna.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Ond oherwydd, y gallwn ni'n mynd i ni mewn i'r nerfau o'r gwasanaeth,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
yna, nerfau y gwasanaeth,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
y gallwn ni'n mynd i ni, a dydw i ddim yn ymwneud â'i hun,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
oherwydd dyna, mae'n bwysig i chi gyd yn cael ei gosod,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
os ydych chi'n cael gyd yn dda.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
A yw, yn ogystal â'r bod chi'n gweithio'n gwych.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Roeddwn yn gweithio'n gwych.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Felly, oes gennych chi'n credu bod chi'n mynd i'r ffordd o'i hun?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Dwi ddim yn gwybod, mae'n ddiddordeb yn ddiddordeb,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
mae'n ddiddordeb yn ddiddordeb,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Mae'n ddiddordeb iawn i rywun pobl,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
pan ganddynt yn ymwneud â'r gwasanaeth,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
mae gennych chi ganddynt o'r bryd.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Rwy'n ennill y bydd Jaclyn a dyd yn mynd ymlaen un peth,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
o weithiau,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
a roeddwn i'n gweithio at y peth,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
ac roeddwn ni yn ymwneud â'r clwb,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
a'r gwledyddion,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
i'r Llew Gweithwyr,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
sy'n Llew'n bryd.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Roeddwn wedi cael'r cyfnod i'r ddŵr!

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Oherwydd roeddwn yn gweithredwr.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Ond pan fyddai'n ganddynt i'n cael Jaffey yn yno,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
roedd yn rhan o'r bryd.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Rhan o'r bryd o'r gweithredwr?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Ie, roeddwn yn gweithredwr.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Roedd rhai o'r gweithredwr eraill ddim yn gwybod,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
ond roedd un o'r gweithredwr o'r brifysgwyr yn eu gwybodaeth.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Felly roedd yna element o'r snob a'r gweithredwr?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
O, ie, ie, ie.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Ond roeddwn yn gwerthu'n bryd i'r ffordd.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Rwy'n credu, roeddwn yn dweud unrhyw beth o'r stori am y gweithredwr a'r ddŵr yn dod.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Yn y ddau, un o'r pethau, bob amser roedd yn mynd yn y ffactor,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
oherwydd roeddwn yn chattu a chael llawer o ddŵr,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
a chael ffactor o ddŵr.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
A bob amser roedd yn ei ddod i'r ffactor,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
roedd ei ddŵr yn Harry Nash,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
mae'r ddau yn y ffactor,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
byddai'n canu,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
roedd yn ei ddod, roedd yn ei taru, roedd yn ei ddynnu, roedd yn ei ddynnu.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Mae'r ddau yn gwybod yw'r hyn?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Nid oes, nid oes,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
mae'n meddwl arno am ei,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
a mae'n meddwl arno am ni neu beth.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
A gallai ganddi a chael unrhyw beth,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
boeddwn yn gobeithio ei bod yn eithaf yn eithaf.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Mae'n mynd yn y ffactor,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
mae'n ffactor,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
mae'n ffactor,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
a byddwn yn dechrau i gyd yn ei ddynnu.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Rwy'n meddwl, 500 ddau,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
er bod nhw'n ddynnu'n ddynnu,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
gallai ganddi gwych ddau.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
A byddai'n bwysig ar y top o'r ddau yma.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
A dyna sut y byddai'n dod i'w gael eu ffactor yn y ffactor.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Y ffactor?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Roedd e'n gael ei gwych.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Roedd e'n gael ei gwych, roedd e'n gael ei gael yn unig.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Dydw i'n credu ei fod yn cael atynt.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Roedd yn gwych yn y ffactor.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Roedd yn amlwg ar ei hunain y ddau yma.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Dwi ddim yn gwybod pam fyddwn i'n gweithio ar ei hunain,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
ond roedd yn unig ar ei hunain.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Oherwydd, oherwydd, pan oeddwn i'n mynd i'w ddod,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
pan oeddwn i'n mynd i'w ddod yn R.S.W.,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
roedd yn y ffactor.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Roedd yn gwych i fynd yno,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
a roeddwn i'n gwych ar y ffactor o ddau neu ffactor o'r ffactor yma,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
o ran newydd.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
A oedd yn y ffactor,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
pan oedd fy mwyth yn ddod,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
roeddwn i'n ddod o ddynnu'r ddau o ddwy ffactor.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Roedd yn gwych i'n ddod i'r ffactor,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
y ffactor yma,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
ac roedd yn gweithio ar hyn o ddwy ffactor,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
oherwydd, rwy'n eithaf, roeddwn i roedd yn ddod i'r ffactor yma,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
a oeddwn i ddod yn ddod i'r ffactor.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Felly roedd yn cael ei ddod o ddod i'r ffactor.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Yr un pwysigwch ddau,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
mae'n ei ddod i'r mwyaf,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
ac yna mae'r clive wedi'i ddod yn y ffactor.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Pan oeddwn i'n mynd yn ôl,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
pan oeddwn i'n ddod i'r ffactor,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
roedd yn ddod i'r ffactor.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Ond yna beth yw'r ffordd?

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Oherwydd dyna'r ffordd yna.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Ond roedd wedi'i gwybod bod hynny'n cael problemau.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Roeddwn i'n dweud,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
a os yw'r cas,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
gallwch chi ddod i'r gweithd.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Roeddwn i ddod,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
dydw i'n ddod i'n ddod i'r gweithd,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
gallwch chi ddod i'r gweithd y ddod i'r gweithd.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
A dyna'n hynny.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Mae'r hwn yn y ffordd o'n gysylltuad.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Felly roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ffactor.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
A roeddwn i'n cael ymddygiad yma o'r Ken Williams,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
a'r ymddygiad o'r Jacqueline

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
yn gweithio ar hyn.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
A roeddwn i'n mynd i'r gweithio ar hyn.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Ond roeddwn yn ceisio ddod i chi ddod yn ôl angen?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Nid, nid.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Roeddwn yn cael ei ddod yn ôl angen?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Ond beth rwy'n ei wneud,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
na'i ddod oedd oes grifau i gael bopethau eall.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:53.520
Ar hyn,

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.520

ac o ten bach ymarfer yma y malwyd.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.180
Mae wedi ni ddod

A oedd e 32″.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:16.460
ac roeddwn i'n gweithio'n dda i'w ddod o'r bach.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.460
Roedd yn dweud i'r holl bobl yn y ffactor,

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.460
a byddai'n dweud y peth yn dda.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.460
O'i ddod o'r bach?

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.460
Ie, yn bwysig.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.460
Ie.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.460
A felly roeddwn i'n ddod i'r holl bobl a dweud,

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.460

Byddwch chi'n ffwrdd, Pat?

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.460
Nid yw'n ffwrdd.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.460
Oherwydd roeddwn i'n credu ei fod yn cudd,

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.460
oherwydd roeddwn i'n credu ei fod yn cudd.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.460
Oherwydd roedd wedi'i ddod i ni.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.460
Roedd yn cael ei ddynnu ar ei.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.460
ar ddweud, roedd yn teimlo'r blosau a phosiectau.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.460
Roedd yn ddigon ymlaen gyda'r

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.460
gwella'r adnodd.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.460
Oherwydd roeddwn i'n dweud,

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:00.460
roeddwn i'n dweud,

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.460
o'n ddafodd,

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.460

oherwydd dwi'n credu bod Cyn Williams yn gallu cael ychwanegol ychydig

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:38.660
os oedd yn gadael. Oherwydd roeddwn i'n gweithio ar Cyn, ac roedd Cyn yn gweithio ar Branson.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:43.660
O, i'n gwybod. Felly roedd hi'n gallu cael ychwanegol oherwydd y math o ddod o ddod,

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.660

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.660
Ie, oherwydd mae'n gwybod, nid yw'n?

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.660
Felly, yna roedd wedi dweud i mi, sut ydych chi'n ei wneud?

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.660
Roeddwn i'n gallu ei wneud gyda chytn.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.660
Felly roedd hi'n dweud, a dwi'n mynd i fynd i fynd i fyny i chi?

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.660
Felly dyna beth dwi'n ei wneud.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.660
Roeddwn i'n mynd i fynd i fyny a'i gael box o chytn.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.660
Felly roeddwn i ddim yn cael chytn am ddod o ddod.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.660
O, fyddwch chi'n gwybod.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.660
Roedd hi'n man sydd nid oedd yn gwybod pan roedd hi'n gweithio.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.660
Felly, sut y bydd hi'n gallu gwneud gweithwyr ffactor?

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:26.660
Rwy'n bwysig y bydd hi'n rhaid i fod yn fwy eithaf o bobl yno.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.660
Wel, sut y bydd Hitler wedi cael lle y bydd hi?

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.660
Roedd hi'n oed fel Hitler. Roedd yn oed fel Hitler.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.660
Roedd yn agor fel Hitler. Roeddwn i'n cael ei ddod yn y ffurwyr.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.660
Yn oed i'w ffyrdd?

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.660
Wel, roeddwn i'n ddweud unrhyw ddweud i'w ffyrdd.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:41.660
A beth roedd yn dweud?

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.660
Roedd yn dweud, chi'n oed yn ymwneud yn eich arn, fy gof.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.660
Roedd wedi bod yn cael hynny efo hynny efo hynny.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:53.660
Ond roedd wedi cael ymwneud yn y ffyrdd oherwydd, pan oeddwn i'n y bus,

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:56.660
roeddwn i'n dweud yn ymwneud am ddwyfusio'r bobl.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:00.660
A roeddwn i'n dweud, roeddwn i'n dweud, roeddwn i wedi cael bobl hatt ar y gaf

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.660
a'r moustasio yn ymwneud yn y pif.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:07.660
Roeddwn i'n dweud, ar y bus, am ymwneud.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:11.660
Roeddwn i'n dweud, os oes unrhyw beth yn dda, roeddwn i'n dweud, mae'n cael bobl hatt ar y gaf.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:15.660
Roeddwn i'n dweud, mae'n cael bobl hatt ar y gaf,

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.660
a'r ffordd hyfforddiol sydd yn gallu cymryd.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:22.660
Felly, roedd wedi cael ymwneud hynny un di, a roedd wedi cael y cap ar y gaf.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.660
Roedd wedi cael ymwneud, a roedd wedi nesmoka'r bobl hatt oherwydd roedd wedi cael

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.660
roedd yn rhan o'i bwyd yn y gormio o'i ddwyfusio.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.660
Roedd wedi cael y bobl hatt yn y ddwyfusio'r gallwn ni barod o'r unrhyw un.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:36.660
Roedd wedi cysylltu i mi, roedden nhw'n dweud, dyna, y byddai'r noes yn mynd i'w byth.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:42.660
Mae'n gwybod, pan fyddai'r bobl yn gweithio'r cap a'i swgfwm.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.660
Roedd wedi cael y ffordd o'i ddwyfusio.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.660
Roedd wedi cael y ffordd o'i ddwyfusio.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:51.660
Felly roedd yn dda, roedd yn dda, ond roedd yn dda, roedd yn ffwrdd i'w ddweud.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:26.660
Felly roedd yn gwybod i gyd yn dda, a hynny'n gwybod, dwi ddim yn gallu ei fywyd.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.660
8 o'clock.

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:28.660
8 o'clock.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.660
Felly mae hyn yn dda, roedd yn dda, roedden nhw'n gweithio'r 5.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.660
Ond roedd yna ffrif yn y gormio, yn hytrach.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:41.660
Roedd y ffrif 10 munud yn dda, mewn a chanol, roedd y ffrif.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.660
A roedd yna anhygoel i'w ddwyfusio.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.660
No, dydw i'n ddwyfusio'n ddwyfusio.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:25.520
I don't know, this woman I, this Mrs Gailo used to be the training officer. They were talking about they needed another super, well they needed someone to take over all these

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:35.680
candelwick machines you see, and they said why don't you give Pat a try, I think she should be good. So that's how it came about.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:41.680
But did you find it difficult because you've been one of the girls, I mean supervisor you've got to keep a distance a bit have you?

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:52.680
It changed my relationship with Jackie. I will say that it did change the relationship that I had with those special friends that I was always with.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:16:01.680
Because you can't be seen to be having favourites. And I didn't work with them anymore because I worked with a different set of people.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:11.680
So you start these people when you, they'd only worked in the factory for a fortnight and I worked with them so they didn't really know a lot about me at the time when it started.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.680
So where was this now, this was in?

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:29.680
Lotteries. But what I say is, and I'd always been saying this, you don't know, there's 500 of them and you might know individuals, few individuals throughout the factory

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:38.680
and you know a lot by sight because you don't really know them. But you see them often enough to know that they're part of the factory workers.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:47.680
But because you're one of a few, they'll know every single thing about your business. And they think they know you.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:55.680
So when they meet you out, they'll greet you like an old friend thinking that you know just as much about them as they know about you.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:05.680
But you don't, you see. They're just a face in a crowd. And you only get to know the ones that you were immediately working with.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:20.680
Like I knew all of my team that I had, my candle-wick machinists. But it's very rarely, and you have individual friends, that's why you'd be waving across the factory.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:32.680
Because your friend would be working in a different thing on the other side of the factory. And you all learned to live with so you could talk to them over the noise and over the distance that you were away.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:38.680
Did you find that difficult then that you'd been separated from your friends?

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:50.680
No, not really, no. I was conscious of it. Perhaps somebody else wouldn't have been conscious of it. But I was conscious that it had made a difference.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:18:00.680
And did you mind that as you were saying, everybody knew who you were, and everybody thought they knew your business. Did you mind that?

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:13.680
No, no, because it's inevitable. You were of interest to them. They all want to think that they know you, because you were in a superior position.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:27.680
So they talk about you, either good or bad. They probably hate your guts. But they wanted to know you, so they want to know all about you.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:32.680
It's a strange phenomenon.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:42.680
Would there be a lot of gossiping going on then in the factory? About the people working there?

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:52.680
Yes. What women are, some of it is quite catty. But it depends on you. If you are catty, then you can belong to this catty group.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:19:06.680
But if you're not, they don't come into your area, because you have nothing to do with them. Even in a factory, the type of person you'd want to be friends with,

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:15.680
you wouldn't be friends with the ones you wouldn't be friends with in any circumstances, because they're not your sort. You've got nothing in common.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.680
But aren't you friends with the people who are sitting next to you?

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.680
Yes, oh yes.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.680
Just because of circumstances?

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:33.680
Yes, because of circumstances. But then they might be talking about other people outside your group. But you don't have to belong to that, do you?

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.680
No, you don't have to take part.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:44.680
So you don't have to take part. So they know it would be no good talking to you about other people, because you weren't interested.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:54.680
Was a supervisor's job something that was coveted then? Because you know it gave you privileges like the toilet.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.680
No, I don't think it was.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:01.680
Some people do well with responsibility, but some don't, do they?

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:15.680
What I found, when I worked in the hospital, I was always trying to find supervisors, and it's no good advertising and bringing somebody in from outside. It doesn't work.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.680
Why not?

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:29.680
Well, when they don't know the setup, they don't know the hospital, they've got to have someone to teach them from scratch. It's not what you want with a supervisor.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:42.680
They're not useful to you. But to try and get some of the girls who you knew would do well to take on the responsibility was hard.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:57.680
Because that big step over the threshold of being one of the girls and being in management is, you know, some of them didn't want to take it. They didn't want it. They wanted to be with the girls.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:11.680
So I instigated a system where there was a couple of girls who were really good, I had, when I worked in the hospital, and they wouldn't take on a supervisor's role.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:24.680
So in the end I said to the one girl, she's done really well for herself now, why don't you take it on temporarily and give it a try?

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:35.680
I said, you can work with Margaret and she'll show you the ropes. This is one of my supervisors. So she did that for a day and I thought, well that's not really working.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:48.680
So because they didn't, the girls didn't respect that she was now supervising. So I ordered some more overalls and I gave her a supervisor's overall.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:22:01.680
And I said, when you do your supervising duties, you have to wear a supervisor's uniform so that all the girls know that you're no longer one of them.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:13.680
You are a supervisor and you have other responsibilities. So she gave it a go so that when the vacancy came, I had a trained supervisor ready to step in.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:24.680
Because she took the job then, because she knew what it entailed and she wasn't afraid of it anymore and she'd sorted out a relationship with the rest of the girls.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:42.680
So it wasn't a big transition from one role to the other. And when she left me, she went into, when they went out to tender in the hospital, she went in, she came to see me and said that she was going to apply.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:54.680
That she was going to apply for this job on the monitoring side of the new contract. And I said, go for it. There was a lot more money than she had.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:23:01.680
Because what I said to her in the beginning was, you don't always want to be a cleaner. There's more to life than cleaners.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.680
But there's nothing wrong with that, is there?

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:09.680
Oh no, but the money aspect of it, she was only getting paid a cleaner's money.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:20.680
And if she had the chance to go on and increase her earnings, the whole family benefited, didn't they? Her husband, the kids.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:26.680
I said, you want to look at it like that, you have to look at what you're getting for going out every day.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:32.680
But do you think that lack of, well ambition's probably not the right word, but lack of confidence then.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:37.680
Yeah, lack of confidence and really lack of ambition because they don't think they can do it.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:46.680
She was a brilliant supervisor and she's gone on, she's got quite a high position in the hospital now from this monitoring job.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:54.680
You know, I often think, if I hadn't pushed you, you would never have started. She didn't know she could do it.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:11.680
And there was a couple of others who I pushed in the same way because some women got no ambition and they don't look at the far distance thing with money.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:16.680
If you can increase your earnings, that's what you should be trying to do.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:26.680
But it might be that lack of confidence though, do you think? Because perhaps it's the way they've been brought up, that they haven't been told that they can do stuff.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.680
Yeah, it's lack of confidence.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:37.680
Do you feel that you were respected when you were a supervisor? Because you were a production manager as well, weren't you?

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:42.680
Well, as much as you can do, they don't like you because you tell them what to do.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:47.680
You know, you're always being popular, you can be popular and then popular.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:25:03.680
If you always get things done, if you do your job, that's the thing, if you do what you're paid for, they're going to always want you to do beyond their side.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.680
You know, how can I explain?

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.680
The management you mean?

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.680
No, the girls.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.680
Because you've got to control these girls, haven't you?

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:19.680
It's a peculiar relationship you've got with the people who work for you.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.680
You've got to be able to make them do what you want without any hassle.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:33.680
And if you say, do it, they're going to do it because they know that you're not taking advantage of them and you're not bossing them around.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:37.680
They've just got to do it because you've told them they've got to do it.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.680
It's a difficult relationship.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:46.680
But did you feel like piggy in the middle a bit then, because you were trying to fulfil what the management wanted as well?

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.680
No, I never felt that with the girls.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:57.680
I did feel that sometimes with fellow supervisors.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.680
Sometimes there was a lot of bitchiness.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:08.680
When I first took supervisor, there was a lot of resentment about it from other supervisors.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.680
Why though?

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.680
I don't know why, but they didn't like it.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.680
Perhaps they felt threatened or something?

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:17.680
I don't know, they just didn't like it.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:27.680
And there was one or two that were really helpful, but there was one or two that you had to watch because they would be after your blood really.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:31.680
But in what way would that manifest itself?

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.680
Would they be talking about you?

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:37.680
No, they would tell you wrong information.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.680
That's fairly sneaky.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.680
It is, yeah.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.680
That's what I found.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:45.680
But then if I went to one of the others and said, you know, what about that?

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.680
They'd say, oh no, no, don't do that.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:52.680
And so there was people who were helpful and people who weren't.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:58.680
And it was always amazing which ones turned out to be helpful to you.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.680
Oh right, well that's interesting.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.680
Not who you would necessarily have predicted then.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.680
Yeah, predicted, yeah.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.680
Can you remember how much you were paid then?

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.680
£1.76 when I started.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:16.680
So were you given a pay rise every so often then?

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:21.680
We usually got a pay rise every year, but because it was all age incremented.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:29.680
You know, if you started and you were 15, which I was 15, you had the wages of a 15-year-old.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:36.680
Then when you were 16 you'd have a bit more, and 17, and then you would get full pay at 18.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.680
You wouldn't get full pay until you were 18.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.680
But work in Peace Work, it didn't matter.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.680
But your rate was less though, wasn't it?

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:51.680
Your basic rate was less, but you got the same money for the Peace Work.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.680
They didn't pay you less Peace Work.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.680
The rate for the Peace Work was universal.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.680
So you'd get what you earned.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.680
You know we were talking about unions before.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:10.680
I assumed they were something that became stronger a bit later on, were they?

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:15.680
There was never a union to encompass the clothing trade.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.680
It was very difficult.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.680
It would have to be the general workers union.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.680
So not many people in those.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.680
Do you think it was something that was needed?

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:25.680
Oh yeah.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.680
But why though?

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.680
Well because it stopped.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.680
I mean I could always stick up for myself.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.680
I know, but if somebody didn't like a job they could go somewhere else, couldn't they?

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.680
Yeah, it was very easy to walk.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.680
There was no trouble.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:47.680
Not like today, if you're unemployed you're unemployed and getting another job is, today is difficult.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:51.680
You could walk, you could finish on a Monday and start work on a Tuesday.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.680
So why would you need a union then?

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:58.680
Not in those days, but it would have been useful.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:04.680
I didn't believe in unions when I was, my mother didn't believe in unions, you see.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.680
So I didn't believe in them.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.680
So I would never have joined a union.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:14.680
Plus you had to pay the union fees which you didn't want taken out of your wages.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:18.680
But bad enough with national health, you know.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.680
I forgot what I was going to say now.

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:28.680
But you could say that the work the unions did was detrimental sometimes.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.680
You know, when they became quite powerful.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.680
Never in the clothing trade.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:38.680
I tell you what, there was a strike which is, I think, significant.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.680
And people committed suicide over it.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.680
There was a strike in the clothing trade.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.680
I was never part of it.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:48.680
It was years before the war.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:54.680
These people, and I think now when you think about it, it's very relevant today.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:30:01.680
These pile of clothing workers in the Midlands came out on strike.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.680
They wanted thrup'n seipni more an hour.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.680
Thrup'n seipni, now I ask you.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.680
Thrup'n seipni.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:15.680
And they were out nearly eight, I think it was eight, nine weeks.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:19.680
And they went back and they got one and a half pennies.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.680
That was the only increase they had.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.680
The strike failed.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:30.680
And in that time the people were in such desperate need of money.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.680
In such desperate straits.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.680
Because it's men and women, mind.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:37.680
There's a lot of men working in the clothing trade.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:41.680
But they didn't have any money and the families were starving.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:44.680
No help like the miners had when they were out.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.680
They were just on their own.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.680
No, not any real unions.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.680
So when was that? Before the war, you said?

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.680
I think it was before the war.

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.680
It was talked about within the clothing trade.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:02.680
I often think, you know, well, thrup'n seipni.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.680
What's thrup'n seipni today?

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.680
It's not 6p, is it?

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:07.680
No.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.680
It's about 2p.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.680
And all they got was one and a half pennies.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.680
Three eights.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.680
It starved for a few months, didn't it, Bro?

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:19.680
Yeah, oh yeah.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.680
And that's all the extra pay they got.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:27.680
So all the strike and all the suffering was for three eights.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.680
It's sad, isn't it?

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.680
It is, yeah.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.680
And I think it epitomises the times then.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.680
And what the times are now.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:42.680
Where people had not, the headlines in the paper I saw today,

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:46.680
or a couple of days ago, was an old paper.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.680
I think it's a good old paper.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:53.680
Saying civil servants are coming out on strike

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:59.680
because they've been insulted with one percent pay increase.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:03.680
Now, one percent of nothing is nothing.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:07.680
One percent of what the government earn is worth having.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.680
Yeah.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:12.680
But they've been earning good wages, you see, for a long time.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:17.680
I think they feel threatened perhaps.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.680
It's been eroded away.

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.680
But it is being eroded away for everybody.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.680
They've got pensions now.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:28.680
And I think people who start work now are much, much worse off

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:34.680
because they're not going to get the pensions that workers who started years ago will get.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.680
No, they've got to work till they're 70 for a start, haven't they?

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.680
90 probably.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.680
By that time.

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.680
By the time they get to it, yes.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:48.680
And you've got these people who are earning 600,000 a year.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.680
You know?

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.680
Yeah.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.680
There are no cutbacks for the people on the top.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.680
That's the problem.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.680
No.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.680
And it's got to be wrong.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.680
It has definitely got to be wrong.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:01.680
So it's about time that...

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:06.680
Well, I remember seeing on the television a coloured American

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:12.680
who was looking into slavery, was doing a degree on slavery.

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:17.680
And he came here because out of the whole of the world,

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:22.680
the British were the biggest enslaved lot.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:29.680
We were more enslaved than African slaves working in the sugar plantations.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.680
We were slaves.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.680
You were a slave.

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:36.680
Because if you worked on a sugar plantation and you were a slave,

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.680
you were a commodity.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:45.680
So they might have beaten you up and treated you rotten,

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:53.680
but you did get fed and you did get clothing and you did have somewhere to sleep.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:34:00.680
Well, in this country, during the same period, people didn't get that.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:06.680
They didn't get a decent wage, they didn't get clothes, they didn't get food.

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:12.680
And if they hented on the lordships' land for rabbits, they'd probably get...

00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:13.680
Shipped off.

00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:14.680
Yeah, shipped off, yeah.

00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:20.680
So he reckoned this guy, that the British public, the British people,

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:23.680
were the most enslaved nation in the world.

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:27.680
And it's the same today, we really are slaves.

00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:28.680
Yeah.

00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:32.680
My father always used to say, because he was a miner,

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:35.680
although he had different views to all the other miners,

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:40.680
he was very individual, but he used to say that the horses were looked after better than the workers.

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:41.680
Yeah, I bet, yeah.

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.680
Because they were worth more, weren't they?

00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:44.680
Oh yeah, yeah.

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:47.680
Well, he's always another worker, a lot.

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.680
You have to go and look for a horse.

00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:51.680
You know, it's a fact.

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.680
And that's what this boy's thesis was about.

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:59.680
When he was talking about it, I thought, yes, you're absolutely right.

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.680
You know, you are right.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:09.680
I think they've got a much more relaxed attitude to work on the continent even, haven't they, than here.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:15.680
You know, there's more of an exploitative element in this country, perhaps.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.680
It's the establishment.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:24.680
If we didn't have the establishment, we would be all right as a nation.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.680
I don't think that's going to change very soon.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.680
No, because the thing is, they're getting poorer, that's the only thing.

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:34.680
Some of them are getting richer, but the majority of them are getting more.

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:38.680
The old lot, the old lot that...

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:39.680
Old money.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.680
Yeah, old money is getting tighter, but the new money is just...

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.680
Yeah, on the up.

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:45.680
On the up, yeah.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:51.680
Was there anybody that you admired, either in lotteries or in RSW, anybody you looked up to?

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:56.680
Well, I know he was a rogue, but I quite liked Harry Nash.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.680
Yes, I worked with another guy.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.680
An Irish guy, an Irish name.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.680
He was lovely.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:12.680
I worked a lot with him.

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.680
I worked a lot with him.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.680
I was working for him when I started, you know.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.680
So why did you admire him, for example?

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.680
Because he was always helpful.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:22.680
Right.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:26.680
He would explain things and he'd be helpful.

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:30.680
And he didn't have a blame...

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:33.680
He wasn't part of the blame culture.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:39.680
The majority of people have got to have someone who they can blame when things go wrong.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:40.680
Yes, very true.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.680
It's a blame culture.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.680
There's nobody to blame.

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.680
Not even you, when you're in the middle of it.

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.680
It's just a fact that it happens.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.680
Things can go wrong.

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.680
That's very prevalent now, though, isn't it, blame culture?

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:54.680
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.680
More so now, I think, than back then.

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:58.680
Yeah.

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:09.680
But with, you know, health and safety, for example, if you've left something on the floor and you fall over it, it's the fault of the factory.

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.680
It's not your fault for leaving it there, whereas perhaps years ago you'd be told,

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.680
you shouldn't have put it there then, should you?

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.680
Or whatever.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.680
But there's more people out to make money.

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.680
They think they're going to make some money.

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:29.680
If they fall down, they go to litigation because they're out after the money.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:35.680
People are a lot more conscious of being able to...

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:36.680
Yeah, they're clued up.

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:37.680
Yeah.

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.680
They want to get the money.

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:44.680
So they want to blame somebody so that they can say,

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:47.680
that's your fault and you've got to pay me some money.

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:51.680
Was there any accidents that you remember?

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:55.680
Did I ask you this last time?

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.680
I can't remember.

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:57.680
Needles in fingers.

00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.680
Oh, yes, yes.

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:00.680
But they would take you to the hospital.

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.680
They sent you to the hospital.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.680
Did that happen to you?

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:08.680
I've seen him several times.

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.680
Yes, and I did once fall over.

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:17.680
They had a doctor that used to come in and examine all new.

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.680
If you had to watch him, he was a bit...

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:24.680
You know, today, when I see these things about Russ...

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:25.680
Rob Harris?

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:30.680
Rob Harris and all these others, I think you didn't know what we had to go through.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.680
So what do you mind asking?

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:33.680
Sorry, I shouldn't laugh, really.

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.680
So what would he do?

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.680
He'd always have to strip to the waist.

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:41.680
And if you wouldn't take your bra off, he would go...

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:44.680
Ping it?

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.680
Yes, ping your bra.

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:49.680
Why would you need to do that?

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.680
That was him.

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:54.680
He used to enjoy his job, he did.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.680
Everybody told...

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.680
All the girls went on about it.

00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:00.680
They'd go, oh, I've got to go and see this.

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:01.680
I can't remember what his name was.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.680
That's just as well, really.

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.680
But it was a laugh.

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.680
Everybody had suffered.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.680
That's just how it was.

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.680
Somebody told him, well, literally.

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:15.680
Nobody had complained either.

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:18.680
I don't think they did.

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.680
He was a fact of life, you know.

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:25.680
You had to go and have this medical, and he was the doctor that did the medical examination.

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.680
And that's the way he was, you know.

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.680
He'd touch you up.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.680
So you didn't take any notice.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.680
It was an odd deal by...

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.680
You didn't have a nickname for him, did you?

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.680
No, I don't think they did.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.680
They'd say, oh, God.

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.680
Especially if you were ordered to go for some reason or other.

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.680
You had a rash or anything.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:49.680
You'd still have to take your bra off.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.680
Strip to the waist.

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.680
But it was just a fact of life.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.680
I think that you had a lot...

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:01.680
But would he actually touch somebody or just have a look?

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.680
Yeah, have a look.

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.680
That wouldn't happen today, would it?

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.680
No, he'd be sued.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.680
Have a kill.

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.680
That's what I think they'd say.

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:17.680
He sexually harassed them.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.680
Or, you know...

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:23.680
I think to myself, you kept out of his way.

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.680
You never voluntarily went to see this man.

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.680
Only if you were ordered.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:34.680
So a lot of that on theirs is a similar type of thing.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:37.680
Why didn't they just keep out of his way?

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.680
How often was he in the factory?

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.680
He wasn't there full-time. He counted.

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:48.680
No, he'd come sort of once a month.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.680
He'd be in with the nurse.

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:53.680
You'd always have the nurse there, mind.

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:57.680
So what would he be like if he didn't have the nurse?

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.680
It was just a fact of life.

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:07.680
So if you were ordered to go and see the doctor, it would be about a rash or something?

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:11.680
Or something, because you get dermatitis in...

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.680
Oh, do you? In factories?

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.680
With cloth.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:19.680
Because you get mites that live in the cloth.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.680
Oh!

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:27.680
You know, it's like a mite that is living in the cloth.

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:28.680
In wool?

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.680
All sorts of things, yes.

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.680
Oh, right. I hadn't realised that.

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:36.680
You get bitten by... they're almost invisible. You can't see them.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.680
So who would notice that then?

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:41.680
Well, you would if you were itching, because you're itching.

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:44.680
You wouldn't admit to that if you had to go and see him, would you?

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.680
You didn't have any folk remedies or anything like that to sort it out yourselves?

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:53.680
No, no. But it was something that could happen.

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:56.680
It might not be anything. It might not have been dermatitis.

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.680
But you have to be careful.

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:02.680
You know, because you can become allergic to the cloth.

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.680
Oh, right.

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:09.680
And sometimes there's chemicals in it that come out when it's steamed.

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.680
So that would affect the pressers then, would it?

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:17.680
Pressers would have problems. They'd have respiratory problems.

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:19.680
Oh, gosh.

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.680
It was...

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.680
Dangerous work.

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:26.680
It could be, if you were particularly sensitive.

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:30.680
Yeah. Did some girls ever finish there due to health problems?

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.680
I never heard of anybody.

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:35.680
But there was always a big turnover of females.

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.680
Why is that then? Because it was so difficult?

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.680
No, they just... their jobs were so easy to come by.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.680
They'd get another job and move on.

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:46.680
But what type of job would they get instead of working there?

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:51.680
Well, in Newport there was Santons that were totally different.

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.680
They made water heaters.

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:56.680
But would that work later then?

00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:01.680
I don't think so. It was still the same boring old repetitive stuff.

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:05.680
You know, and there were standard telephones.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.680
Now, standard telephones was a much better job.

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:11.680
You were at market if you worked for standard telephones.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.680
Why, though?

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.680
I don't know. It's all part of the snobbery.

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.680
Was the money better?

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.680
I don't think so.

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:22.680
Better money doesn't necessarily reflect status, though, does it, with work?

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.680
No, but the thing is, if you'd worked...

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:28.680
A couple of my friends worked at standard telephones,

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:33.680
and I don't honestly know what they do, what they were doing.

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:38.680
But I think they thought they were educationally a bit better.

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:42.680
You know, you can't tell with women.

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:47.680
It's strange. It's become a fact.

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:51.680
But if you worked in the clothing factory,

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:54.680
it was something you had for the rest of your life.

00:43:54.680 --> 00:44:01.680
You would learn something which was useful and pertinent to the rest of your life.

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.680
If you were good at learning,

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:08.680
because it wasn't just piecework and repetitive stuff,

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:11.680
you could make garments for yourself.

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:14.680
You could make garments for your children.

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:17.680
I used to make suits for my ex-husband,

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:20.680
because I knew how to do it.

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.680
Is it because you worked in a particular type of clothing factory?

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:26.680
Yeah, because it was a uniformed tanner.

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:30.680
It wasn't just sewing parts of blouses.

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:34.680
Because that wouldn't necessarily have given you those skills, would it?

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:39.680
No, no, but you still have learned something that's useful.

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.680
Because if you can use a sewing machine,

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:45.680
you can use your sewing machine in your home life, can't you?

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:51.680
And then when you get to 60 and you've retired, you can become a quilter.

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:56.680
Can you remember any rules and regulations then?

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.680
For example, were there any sacrible offences?

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.680
I'm sure there must have been.

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:17.680
But if you're not sort of bolshy and causing trouble and causing fights.

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:21.680
I mean, there used to be trouble, especially over fellers.

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.680
They would fight over fellers.

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.680
Physically, obviously.

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:28.680
Physically, some of them.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.680
Do you remember seeing anybody fighting?

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:35.680
I think once, when she was over a man.

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.680
On the factory floor?

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.680
No, it was something out of work.

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:43.680
All right. But where were they fighting in the factory?

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.680
In the toilets.

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.680
Oh gosh.

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.680
In the toilet area, you know, in the cloakroom.

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.680
Yeah, yeah.

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:57.680
But you'd have had to have been sort of interested in that.

00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:02.680
I mean, I did know that it was going on and everybody was going down to have a look,

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:05.680
but I was more interested in money.

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:08.680
Who would have stopped it then? Supervisors?

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.680
Supervisors, I expect.

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.680
Or the other girls.

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.680
Yeah.

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:19.680
Were you ever made aware of health and safety then at the time?

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:26.680
No. Health and safety was nothing until, that's a recent thing.

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:32.680
What about conditions then? Were the both factories, were they well heated?

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:36.680
I know some factories were cold in the winter and hot in the summer,

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.680
just because of the nature of the building.

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.680
So what was it like in lotteries?

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:46.680
It used to get very hot in the summer.

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:49.680
They used to white out the windows in the roof.

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.680
Was it a new building or an old building?

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:54.680
It was a new factory unit at the time.

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.680
Oh, right. Yeah.

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:58.680
I remember you saying now it was a new building.

00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:01.680
It was a big, because they came down from London, you see.

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:02.680
Yes, yeah.

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:04.680
They relocated.

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.680
To get cheaper labour possibly.

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:08.680
That's it.

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:12.680
We spoke about music last time. We enjoyed that story.

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:18.680
I was in a military band and it was noisy on the factory floor.

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:20.680
It was very noisy.

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:22.680
You didn't mind that though, you got used to it.

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:26.680
You didn't hear it in the end. The only thing is you couldn't hear.

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:29.680
It was no good trying to talk to somebody right over there.

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.680
That's why everybody could lip read.

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:37.680
If you were talking to a woman where that lamp is, you wouldn't be able to hear it really.

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.680
But you couldn't get up and go over. You'd be wasting time.

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.680
Yeah.

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:46.680
Do you think any girls suffered any long-term effects on their health then?

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:48.680
Well, I think it affects hearing.

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:51.680
But they won't pay out.

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:58.680
We often have these people ringing up saying they were having a hearing test which was job-connected.

00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:01.680
If you worked in a clothing factory, they won't look at you.

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:02.680
Why not though?

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:06.680
I don't know. The government won't pay compensation.

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:08.680
It's because the bill would be too big.

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.680
Yeah.

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:15.680
And of course as you get older, everybody gets a little bit harder to hear.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:17.680
To prove that it was...

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:22.680
I know we went twice when they ring up now and I say,

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:28.680
if it's clothing trade, you can forget it.

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:33.680
And they say, oh yes, you're right, they just won't look at the clothing trade.

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.680
Silly, isn't it?

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:36.680
Silly, isn't it?

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:38.680
Because it was a noisy environment.

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:42.680
Yeah, it's bound to be. And nobody had anything to put over their ears.

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:45.680
No. Didn't give it a thought, you see.

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:48.680
Because you didn't actually have to hear.

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:53.680
After you'd been in a couple of weeks, you could read with the best of them.

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:55.680
You didn't need anything else.

00:48:55.680 --> 00:49:03.680
Everybody knew that they had to talk and make the mouth shapes.

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:08.680
And it's amazing how far away you can talk to somebody

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:12.680
or understand what they're saying if you can lip read.

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:15.680
Lip read is quite magical,

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:20.680
but you've got to understand the movement of the mouth.

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.680
Because there's no sound.

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:26.680
And it's easy. Do lose the knack mind.

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:27.680
Oh, do you?

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:28.680
Yeah, I don't think I could do it.

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:35.680
I still can to a degree, but not as good as you were when you were there doing it all the time.

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:39.680
But I suppose, oh sorry Mr White, do you want me to stop for a second?

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.680
No, no, no.

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:43.680
I suppose you get used to lip reading certain people as well, don't you?

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.680
Yeah.

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.680
It might be different with strangers.

00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:48.680
Yeah.

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:53.680
But you can understand why they can use lip readers on film when they've got no sound.

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:57.680
And understand what they're saying.

00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.680
Because it is quite easy.

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:04.680
I can't, oh sorry, this one here as well.

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.680
It's lovely, thanks a lot. Thanks.

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:16.680
So the work in a factory was five days a week with possible extra on Saturdays, is it?

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:17.680
Sometimes on a Saturday.

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:23.680
I can't remember because it was a 48-hour week, so I think Saturday was included.

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:30.680
It was eight till five and eight till one or eight till twelve on a Saturday.

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:34.680
But was that all the time or was it just when there were particular orders in?

00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:37.680
No, that was a 48-hour week.

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:38.680
Oh gosh, it's a lot isn't it?

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:39.680
It's what you worked.

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.680
Most people worked a 48-hour week.

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:42.680
Oh did they?

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:43.680
Yeah.

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:46.680
Then they put it down to 40.

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:47.680
Yeah.

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:48.680
And in fact when I worked at the hospital...

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:51.680
Well at 40 it's a day less isn't it? You know?

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:52.680
Yeah, it is really.

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:59.680
And when they put it down to 40 and I started working in the hospital many years later,

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:07.680
I just assumed that it was a 40-hour week, but I was only working a 47-hour week, a 37-hour week.

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:08.680
Oh gosh.

00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:11.680
So I always worked 40 hours, I was always there 40 hours.

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:12.680
Yeah, yeah.

00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:21.680
Because I was used to those sort of hours, 37, you know, and that's sometimes not having a dinner break or anything.

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:25.680
Was there a...there was a canteen in Lothreys, was there?

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:26.680
Oh yeah, a lovely canteen.

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.680
So was that subsidised then?

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:35.680
Yeah, and they did have, also in Lothreys, they had a works council.

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:40.680
That meant it was very...I think works councils are very progressive.

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:49.680
They had different girls from different sections of the factory who would stay behind for an evening,

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:57.680
and they would provide a tea, a substantial tea, and they'd have like a big meeting in the canteen

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:07.680
where they would discuss all the grievances from their sections with management.

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:11.680
But were they supervisors or just representatives?

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:14.680
They were representatives of the factory floor.

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.680
So who would have chosen them then?

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:17.680
Well, the girls did.

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:20.680
Oh right, that is very progressive, isn't it?

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:25.680
And there'd be supervisors there as well, a few. Not all of them, but a few of them.

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:31.680
And top management would be there. You know, Mr Lothreys himself used to come down for the workers' management.

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:33.680
So how often would they be held?

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.680
About every three or four months.

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:40.680
Gosh. So do you remember any decisions being made on the back of these meetings?

00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:44.680
I can't really remember, but I can remember there was a lot of...

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:52.680
One thing, there was always things like the long queues, not moving fast enough at breaks,

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:55.680
because you only had a small amount of time.

00:52:55.680 --> 00:53:02.680
So if you wanted a cup of tea, the teas had to be ready when each section went in,

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:06.680
and you had to be able to pay quickly and sit down and have your tea.

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:14.680
So that was always a bone of contention, the times that the canteen would keep you waiting out of your break time.

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:23.680
Then there was problems with toilets, you know, the cleaning of the toilets, all the cloakrooms.

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.680
What, that they weren't clean?

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.680
That they weren't done properly.

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:35.680
And the complaints about the girls writing on the walls of the toilets. You know, those sort of things.

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:37.680
But who would be complaining about that?

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:40.680
The girls. It was quite rude.

00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:43.680
About other girls, or just rude?

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:47.680
They don't know who did it, you see. Nobody knew who did it.

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.680
They never found out.

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:53.680
Well, it's another form of expression, isn't it?

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:56.680
Yeah. You didn't have to read it.

00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:02.680
I suppose it would all depend whether it was about you or not.

00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:09.680
No, they were really rude. Really, really rude.

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:16.680
Oh dear. Yeah, we were talking about the canteen. The food was good there.

00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:26.680
The food was good, yeah. Never ever complaints about the quality of the food. Just how slow it was being served.

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:30.680
It's very good psychology to give workers good food though, isn't it?

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.680
It is, yeah.

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.680
It keeps them happy, doesn't it, for a while?

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:41.680
Oh yeah. You know, when you only got such a little time, a lot of them took their own food in.

00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:43.680
Did you just take your own?

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:55.680
No. You had to pay for it, but I think that it wasn't extortion, it was reasonable.

00:54:55.680 --> 00:55:00.680
Were the holidays something you were desperate to see coming, you know, having time off?

00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:02.680
You were desperate for time off?

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:09.680
Well, the clothing trade has closed down fortnight, so you weren't given any choice when you had your holidays.

00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:14.680
And they were always the worst two weeks of the year, because it was the last week of July and the first week of August.

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:16.680
Worst for weather.

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.680
Yeah, the worst for weather.

00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:20.680
Nothing new there then?

00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:29.680
So unless you went abroad, which you didn't do in those days, no package to earth. I mean, I used to go abroad.

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:31.680
So where did you go?

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:38.680
Spain. I went to Holland. And I went to Spain.

00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:51.680
But I wasn't your ordinary everyday Renard Pearson. My cousin worked on the railway. She worked for the railway and the office.

00:55:51.680 --> 00:56:01.680
This is the one, I think I told you, that did sitting girls, dressmaking and design, and then went on and taught.

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:11.680
But before that she worked for the British Rail in the offices in Newport. And she used to get cheap rail fare, you see.

00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:12.680
That's handy.

00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:18.680
Yeah, she did, but I had to pay full price. So we used to go on holiday together.

00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:19.680
Oh, lovely.

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:22.680
And my mother would let me go with her, even though I was only fifteen.

00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:27.680
Oh gosh. Well, you wouldn't go abroad when you were fifteen, though, would you?

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:28.680
Yeah.

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:29.680
Gosh.

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:33.680
I went abroad for the first time. But I was with Doreen.

00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:37.680
Before your time. Obviously.

00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:38.680
Yeah.

00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:45.680
The social activities in the factory then, would you socialise much with people outside work?

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:54.680
No, you didn't have time. You just didn't have time because you were working eight till five by the time you got home.

00:56:54.680 --> 00:57:01.680
We all used to go out together. There was always a Christmas dinner dance where the management all came.

00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:03.680
Was that in the factory?

00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:16.680
No, it was in a hotel, a local hotel. So there was the dinner dance. They used to rent trips during the shutdown for people who didn't go on holiday.

00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:19.680
Did they do it in the shutdown?

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:24.680
Yeah, they'd have a couple of trips out. They used to go to Western on the paddle steamer.

00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:26.680
But you had to pay for those, presumably?

00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:30.680
Oh yeah. Go to Barry Island on a bus.

00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:33.680
Was there a sports and social club?

00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:34.680
No.

00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:35.680
No.

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:41.680
But I used to play tennis with two of the fellas in the cutting room.

00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:51.680
We had a tennis court at the back of the factory, adjacent to the canteen. They also used to let me keep the canoe there.

00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:53.680
Canoe?

00:57:53.680 --> 00:58:00.680
Yeah, canoe. My brother and I had a canoe. Of course, we were not far from the river.

00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:02.680
Oh, yes, of course.

00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:09.680
Instead of carting it back and forth on the back of the bike, on a push bike, it's wheeled back and forth.

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:18.680
There's a long way to go with this canoe. They used to let me keep it in a little room off the canteen.

00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:25.680
I told you I wanted the canoes. I don't want to be every day so...

00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:29.680
Well, at least you didn't take the canoe to go to work.

00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:30.680
No.

00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:34.680
But I used to like playing tennis. I played a lot of tennis.

00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:41.680
Were there any other teams? Were there teams of like... I mean, there were football teams in some factories.

00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:57.680
Yeah, oh no. They weren't that sort of... A lot of them used to cycle to work, but they never did anything with cycling as a sport in things.

00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:16.680
You've told me of a few instances already that you remember. Is there any other event that comes to mind when you think about your work, either at lotteries or at RSW, anybody famous visiting or taking a look at what you're doing or any event?

00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:25.680
No, you always have government inspectors for the army or the British railway.

00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:37.680
But of course they don't do that sort of stuff. There's all those big contracts and are no longer relevant because they don't happen.

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:51.680
British Railways provided uniforms for their staff. The army staff is made... Well, look, you look at it, if my son was in the army, it's absolute rubbish.

00:59:52.680 --> 01:00:05.680
When he was in Northern Ireland, he did a 12 month first, and then he did something else and they brought him back from Canada when he was in Canada.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:14.680
And that was the end. He never could go back. So I don't know what they were doing. And he never told me.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:16.680
It was good to keep it a secret then.

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:26.680
Well, they had to. And they couldn't go back. So what they were doing, I don't know. Because it was dangerous for them to go back. Their faces might have been recognised.

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:40.680
And he had a body armour and he brought it home with him because he was going to wash it. I said, I'll wash it. But he said, no. He said, I know exactly what to do with it.

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:51.680
And when I saw it, it was falling apart. I mean, this was body armour. Not like the police wear now. It was absolutely tatty.

01:00:51.680 --> 01:01:03.680
I was disgusted with the quality of it all. Made abroad, you see, somewhere. And it really wanted mending.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:11.680
And when he came home on leave, I was always bending those camouflage stuff he had. They were really tatty.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.680
Oh, were they? You would have thought they'd be hard wearing. They need to be hard wearing.

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:20.680
They need to be, but they're not. They're not quality fabric.

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:21.680
Where are they made then?

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:29.680
I don't know where they're made now. I think they still might be made. Well, I've never heard of anybody making uniform tailoring, doing army stuff.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:34.680
There might be factories in London doing it, but I think they're all made abroad.

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:44.680
Because Gareth, just before he came out, he used to drive warrior personnel carriers.

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:52.680
He didn't talk a lot, my boy. And he used to go off with his major.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:02:05.680
And before the Iraq War, he went to Iraq with his major, or Jordan or somewhere, where they were having...

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:10.680
Because you know when our boys went out, they didn't have any light uniforms. They had to go out in...

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.680
Mad, isn't it?

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:17.680
Well, I think it was criminal. It was really criminal.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:32.680
So the people in the War Office wanted to know what sort of uniforms they were wearing, these armies, the Jordanian army and what the uniforms were like.

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:40.680
And Gareth went with his major on a recce job, looking at and finding out how they manufactured them.

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:48.680
So I don't think they were manufacturing them in this country. It might have been coming from Sri Lanka or somewhere in India.

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:56.680
I know the textile factories in West Wales. They went to Morocco, apparently.

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:08.680
Well, a friend of mine who's got this company in Newport called J&B Builders is a sewing factory. He sells sewing machines.

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:12.680
He's got three factories in Morocco himself.

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:14.680
Making garments.

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:21.680
I think that factories will start coming back here though, eventually.

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:25.680
Well, the wages will be so low, they can't afford Thailand anymore.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:32.680
China, for example. Things are getting more expensive coming from there and they're getting workers' rights now, aren't they?

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:33.680
Oh, yeah.

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:42.680
Because I saw something on the telly the other day, and it showed one Chinese person saying, I'm not working for you anymore. I'm going to work for someone else.

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:50.680
Well, the thing is, Thailand and China are the fastest growing economies in the world.

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:59.680
And when people want more money, and that's what you say to these girls in the hospital, it's the money you've got to go for.

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:04.680
Because at the end of the day, that's what benefits your family most, isn't it?

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:14.680
If you've got to be out working, and most of us can't afford to stay home anymore, you've got to go where you're getting most for your time.

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:18.680
The time you're away from the family.

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:20.680
Yeah, it's got to be worthwhile.

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:25.680
And they get the same. The Japanese and the Chinese used to be Japanese tourists, didn't they?

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.680
But now it's Chinese tourists and Thai tourists.

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:38.680
And even Vietnam. They've got tourists going all over the place. Vietnamese tourists in London.

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:41.680
Because they've got the money now to travel.

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:44.680
Whereas we haven't anymore.

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:47.680
Stay put, and have a lovely weather.

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:51.680
Well, the thing is, I think it's affected Spain's economy.

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:54.680
You know, there's not so many people going to Spain.

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:57.680
Spain's in a terrible state, isn't it?

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:07.680
And because of that, the ones that do go, they go long haul now, don't they? Thailand and Vietnam.

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:11.680
Well, it's cheaper when you actually get there, isn't it? It's quite cheap in places like Vietnam.

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:14.680
Whereas the flights are so cheaper.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.680
And the weather is just the same as Spain.

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:24.680
Spain's got nothing more to offer than Vietnam or Thailand unless you get caught in a tsunami.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:26.680
Which happened to a friend of mine.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:32.680
She was out there during that terrible tsunami.

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:38.680
Staying at that pen beach, the one that was absolutely united.

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:41.680
It took her nearly three years to get over it.

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:44.680
I'm not surprised. Who was she with?

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:47.680
She was with her family. They were all alright. They were all in the hotel.

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:50.680
Which managed to stay standing.

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:52.680
But did the water come in?

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:53.680
Yeah.

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:55.680
Oh, gosh.

01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:01.680
They were on the third floor and the hotel managed to stay standing.

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:05.680
It was absolutely horrific.

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:08.680
It was horrific because the kids were there.

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:15.680
So you know, you pay your men and you take your choice, don't you?

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.680
I don't expect that though, do you?

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:21.680
No, oh no. That was hopefully a one-off.

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.680
Yeah.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:31.680
Just for me to check now, can you remember any dates for when you worked where roughly?

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:34.680
Just for me to try and pin it down.

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:38.680
Well, I started work at 15.

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:43.680
So that's about 1950, 1951.

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.680
And that's at Loutreys.

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:47.680
That's at Loutreys.

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:54.680
I worked there for three or four years.

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:59.680
Then I worked at Western Biscuits for about eight months.

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:02.680
It wasn't longer than that.

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:06.680
Then I went back to Loutreys.

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:10.680
And I stayed there until I was 21.

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:14.680
22 because I was working there when I got married.

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:19.680
And I was married in 1958.

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:31.680
And then I went back again when my daughter was two.

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:35.680
So in 1960 I was back there again.

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:41.680
Then I worked there for about another five, four years.

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:47.680
Then I was working for myself there for a couple of years.

01:07:50.680 --> 01:08:01.680
Then I went to work for Kenny Williams in his other factory in Newport, making stuff for Branson.

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:04.680
Yeah, but that was self-employed, wasn't it?

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:06.680
No, I was working for him then.

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:07.680
Oh, right.

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:12.680
He had a factory, which he was in partnership with Branson.

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:15.680
Where was that, did you say?

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:17.680
That was in Newport again.

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:18.680
Oh, right, okay.

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.680
But the other side of Newport.

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:26.680
Then I went up to Harry and worked for him for five years.

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:31.680
And that was RSW?

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:35.680
Yeah. Then I worked for myself for two or three years.

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.680
What did I do after that?

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:55.680
I did lots of things because people always thought that I could do things and they'd offer you a job and they'd keep on to you until you took it.

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.680
It was nice to be in demand.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:04.680
Oh, but some of these, you know, they expected you to do, to work miracles.

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:08.680
And you couldn't always do it because they didn't give you the authority.

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:09.680
Oh, right.

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:16.680
What types of jobs were you talking about there?

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:19.680
I worked for a security firm.

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:24.680
And the reason I finished with that was because they didn't have a safe.

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:33.680
And sometimes I was sat in the office on my own with about £200,000 in ammunition boxes,

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:37.680
and I was sitting in this little cupboard under the stairs.

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:44.680
And I thought, well, you know, someone's only got to find out about it and it could be nasty.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:47.680
I wasn't prepared to do that.

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:55.680
And what they wanted me to do as well is they were employing a fellow who was a horrible bloke,

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:57.680
and they wanted to get rid of him.

01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:00.680
And they wanted to find out what he did.

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:02.680
They didn't know exactly what he did.

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:09.680
He practically ran the place, but he was crafty, and he was crafty because he used to laugh.

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:11.680
He wouldn't tell you anything.

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:13.680
But there's no crime against that.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:15.680
There's no law against that, is there?

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:16.680
No, there's no law against it.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:24.680
But really and truly, you come across these people who are afraid to tell you because they're afraid to lose their job.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:28.680
They're afraid to give you key information in case you couldn't take their job.

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:30.680
In that case, that was what I was there for.

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:33.680
But, you know, they're funny.

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:35.680
They won't help you at all.

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:37.680
No information.

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:39.680
Oh, I see. All right.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:40.680
You know, they won't help you.

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:41.680
In case you...

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:42.680
He was obstructing your job, see?

01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:43.680
Yes.

01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:44.680
Oh, right, I see.

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:46.680
Yeah. Oh, no, that's no good, is it?

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:47.680
No, it's not.

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:49.680
But it happens all over the place.

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:54.680
See, he wouldn't help anybody, and they couldn't find out exactly what he...

01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:56.680
They knew what he did, but they didn't know how he did it.

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:57.680
Oh, I see.

01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:00.680
He was keeping his cards close to his chest.

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:02.680
Well, they couldn't get rid of him, could they?

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:03.680
So what happened in the end?

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:06.680
Well, I got fed up. I told him I didn't want to work there anymore.

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:07.680
Yeah.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:12.680
Because I would be the only person in this place with all that money.

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:14.680
Yeah. Oh, no, that's no good, is it?

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:15.680
No.

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:20.680
What do you think about some of the myths about working in a factory then?

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:25.680
You know, like the reputation of factory girls sometimes wasn't so good.

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:27.680
Do you think that's unfair?

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:28.680
I do think it's unfair.

01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:29.680
Yeah.

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.680
Because it's a job at the end of the day.

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:33.680
Yeah.

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:35.680
They've got to work hard for whatever money they get.

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:40.680
I think it is unfair. Sometimes it is justified, mine.

01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:41.680
Do you think so?

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:42.680
Yeah, well, yeah.

01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:46.680
I mean, the goings-on were goings-on, you know.

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:47.680
Yeah.

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.680
A lot of them were no better than they should have been.

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:53.680
But then that's their choice.

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:58.680
You know, I can't, you know, just that it gives everybody the same reputation.

01:11:58.680 --> 01:11:59.680
Yeah.

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:05.680
But there were girls working there who were very talented, weren't there?

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:09.680
And they haven't really been given credit for what they've done.

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:11.680
Oh, yeah. And they could have done a lot better for themselves.

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:12.680
Yeah.

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:19.680
All of them were capable of, there was a lot of them there who were capable of doing a lot better, with better jobs.

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:20.680
But the opportunities weren't there.

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:21.680
No.

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:25.680
Well, there was plenty of work, but there wasn't a variety of opportunities, I suppose.

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:30.680
No. It was very difficult to get on if you were female.

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:35.680
So what were the options apart from factory work?

01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:37.680
Shop work, office work.

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:48.680
Things like hairdressing, if you wanted that. But those sort of things don't suit everybody today.

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:49.680
No, they don't.

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:53.680
And it depends what's available in your location as well, doesn't it?

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:54.680
Yeah.

01:12:54.680 --> 01:13:01.680
I mean, I've spoken to some girls who dreamed of doing hairdressing, but they lived out in the country, so that's a point.

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:02.680
Yeah.

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.680
It all depends what's on your doorstep.

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:06.680
Yeah.

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:10.680
And just how, I mean, if you were determined you were going to be a hairdresser.

01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:16.680
But there was always something easier to do.

01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:17.680
Yeah.

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:20.680
So it wasn't worth the struggle.

01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:29.680
So do you think factory work held people back then, in the sense, because it was well-paid work on the doorstep?

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:30.680
Yep.

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:35.680
But then a lot of women haven't got a lot of ambition, have they?

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:45.680
Really and truly, they'd only want to get married, and in those days, within getting married, you're pregnant within the first year, life was settled for you, you know?

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:46.680
Yeah.

01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:55.680
Because you got married and you had a baby within the year, and sometimes you were already having the baby when you got married, you know?

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:56.680
Yeah.

01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:03.680
We'd have chairs in the factory that nobody would sit on, because that was the time you became pregnant.

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:08.680
It was a chair that you didn't sit on.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.680
It was contagious.

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:17.680
That was all part of the myth.

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:25.680
And how would you describe the humour then, in that particular type of workplace?

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:33.680
Well, I think it's great. There's a lot of camaraderie, you know?

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:39.680
You'd have a really good laugh, because it'd make the time go, you see?

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:45.680
I mean, eight hours a day is a lot of hours, nine hours at one time.

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:47.680
But you were busy for all that time, weren't you?

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:48.680
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:50.680
But you needed something else to keep you going.

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:52.680
We needed something to occupy your mind, didn't you?

01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:53.680
Yeah.

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:59.680
That's what I always think about car workers, you see? That was a repetitive, boring thing.

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:07.680
That's why they were always out on strike for more money. They had too much time on their hands, or too much time on their brains.

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:14.680
You know, they could sort of go—and you'd get the ones that want to cause trouble, and they'd all be out, wouldn't they?

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:18.680
And I blamed them for the state that the world is in today.

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:25.680
And the miners, in a way. I think the miners did themselves a disservice.

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:27.680
Oh, that was disastrous.

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:34.680
So why go out for more money? Money was no good to them. The government—so they'd get a big pay rise.

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:41.680
Go out and try and get a big pay rise. It didn't affect them all. Only a certain few would get the money.

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:47.680
And what did they do? The government would take half of it off them in tax.

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:52.680
Well, it was political, wasn't it? It was politically motivated.

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:58.680
They had aging provocateurs there.

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:00.680
Yes, they did.

01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:15.680
You see, I always say that if what the miners came out on strike for was six weeks holiday a year paid, and retirement at 55 on a full pension,

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:21.680
well, that would have been something, hadn't it? Because the only thing that money can do is to buy time.

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:29.680
It's the only thing on God's earth that buys time. If you've got enough of it, you've got more time.

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:39.680
But that's what I think about it. You either haven't got any time because you're working all the time, or you've got plenty of time and no money.

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:44.680
You know? So time is tied up with money.

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:46.680
Yes, it is.

01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:57.680
And that's what they should have gone for. They'd have had a better life because they'd have had six weeks paid holiday, and they'd have retired at 55 on a full pension.

01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:04.680
That's the things that they should have been going for. Not more money, because the government took half of it.

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:09.680
I thought it was not very productive.

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:12.680
Oh, no, it wasn't. It was absolutely destructive.

01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:17.680
Yes. So I do blame them for a lot of the things that went wrong.

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:26.680
Because if they'd got it, it would have affected the rest of our lives. The rest of us, our lives would have improved.

01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:31.680
Because they'd have had to improve all of our working conditions.

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:43.680
That's what I always felt. And especially the car workers, because they were in good. And what good to them. I mean, their industry is in turmoil, isn't it?

01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:45.680
It's gone basically, isn't it?

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:46.680
Yes.

01:17:46.680 --> 01:18:02.680
Because it's gone somewhere else. So they should have been going out for more holidays, paid early retirement. And they'd have benefited. I think they were men who were really stupid.

01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:09.680
I think you're right there. Patricia, that's it. Thank you very, very much. It's been fantastic. Thank you.
