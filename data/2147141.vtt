00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm... I'm Pathan. I don't know whether you know about Pathan.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Yeah, there's the north-western part of Pakistan.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And you know where Osama Bin Laden is hiding? That's the area.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm from Peshawar and my mother tongue is Pashto.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But our medium language was Urdu.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And we learned English as well.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And I can speak the community language, which is Punjabi.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I can speak that. And I can read Arabic.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So it means that few languages I'm capable of communicating.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I used to be a translator as well for the police station,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.000
the Royal Guant for the medical help and immigration.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I have done that, I think, for a long time.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
But after my health issue started, I stopped that.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And I was a teacher. Back home I was a lecturer in college.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Then I came here, I brought up my children.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I got seven children, two boys, five girls.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And they are, Alhamdulillah, they are all highly educated.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Five of them, they are married, two are not.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And then I started as a teacher here in Liswari.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I was working for GEMS, I don't know whether you know about GEMS,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Go into Ethnic Multi-Support Service.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So I worked for them and I worked for Liswari Comp as our Urdu language teacher.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So nearly 27 years I worked there.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I retired in 2014.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And after that, for a little while, I worked as a translator, but then I stopped.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Now I'm a free woman.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I'm enjoying myself, joining different clubs with different friends and spending nice time.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I'll ask a few further questions about that, because that was amazing, that was a lot.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Different pathways and different parts of your story.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
First things first, can you just introduce your name and where you were born in Urdu, and then in English as well please?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
My name is Jehanara Khan.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I was born in Bishawir.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I'm about 75 years old.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I have done my education in Pakistan, then I started my job as well there.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I worked for Radio Pakistan as well.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I worked as a lecturer back home.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And then if you can say that in Urdu as well?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I was an English as a second language teacher.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Oh no, sorry, the introduction.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Can you just say your name and where you were born in Urdu?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
In Urdu? Okay then.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
My name is Jehanara.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
My full name is Jehanara Khan.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I'm from Peshawar, Pakistan.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I'm from Pathan.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
My mother tongue is Pashto.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
But I can also speak Urdu, Punjabi and Hindi.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
I have also taught in different schools here.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
In secondary school 11 plus 18.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I have also done a lot of translation work.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
For the Goint police, for the Goint hospital.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I have taken part in the translation work in different areas.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Thank you.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
If we can start at the beginning.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
What do you remember about your childhood days?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
What I remember about my childhood?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So you've been a child and grown up. What do you remember?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I was the only child.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And because I...

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:55.000
My lifestyle was because my father, he was very keen in education.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And he emphasized most of the time on my education.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
He wouldn't allow me to waste my time in other activities.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
All the time the pressure was to achieve good results.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And books were my good company.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
I studied all the time different books, different knowledgeable books.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And I got few friends.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000
My one friend is nearly, I think, 50 or 55 years.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Relationship we got.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
She is my best friend. She is like my sister.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And I got lots of cousins.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And because I don't know whether you know about Pakistani culture or the Pathan culture.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
They are very isolated people.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000
They mostly spend their time and they spend their different activities,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
participating in different activities between the family.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So I used to have lots of cousins, uncles, aunties.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And on every occasion we get together.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And we don't need anybody outside.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
It's a big family, not like here.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Nuclear family, no.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
We got lots of friends, lots of cousins, lots of aunties, uncles.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And we were visiting each other's houses instead of looking outside.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
So that was my childhood.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I remember my cousins, I remember my family.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I remember all the activities, getting together on Eid.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And there were two weeks or any Saturday or Friday.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
We used to go to our Nana's house.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
We lived there for two days and coming back on Monday for school.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
So that was our lifestyle.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Was there any games? Did you play any games or what?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Games.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I was a very, you know, boy's type girl.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Because I was only a child.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And I used to play with a boy, cricket, football.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Apart from that, there was mainly in the street.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
There wasn't any grounds or anything.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
We used to play in the street.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
In the 60s they used to have it here.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
So these type of games I used to play.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Listening to the music.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And I don't remember anything else.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
I was very good at drawing.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
I was company for my own self.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
I didn't need anybody.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I used to draw and colour and make the pictures.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
So I was quite happy with that.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
What type of things did you draw?

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Pardon?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
What type of things did you draw?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
What did you draw or what did you paint?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Where did I go?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Draw. What did you do?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Human beings.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Flowers.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Natural things.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
River, tree.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
I learned painting.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Now I don't have any practice.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
So I don't think I'll be that good.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I used to love glass painting.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
I used to love embroidery, knitting, crochet.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Because in those days there wasn't anything ready made.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
So we used to make our bed sheets with embroidery, with the flowers.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
That was my hobbies.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And can you... Discipline.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
I just want to talk about also discipline.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Pardon?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Discipline.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Very, very, very disciplined people.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
My father, especially like I said, he wouldn't let me waste my time.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
He was such a lovely father.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
He never touched me.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
But I knew how far I can go.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And without their permission though,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
my mother was a very simple woman.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Not simple in that way, but a very easy going person.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
But we did have respect.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Respect for our elder people.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And still I'm teaching my children the same.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.000
In the street, wherever we live, they can't call anybody by the name.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
When I first came here, people used to call me Mrs. Khan, Mrs. Khan.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And I can't understand that because in our culture you call everybody auntie or uncle.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:09.000
So this type of discipline, not going out after 7 o'clock, staying home,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.000
don't give a setback, respect your elder, whatever they say, obey it.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
That was the lifestyle.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And I appreciate it.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
I'm in favour of that.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Though we are not having that now.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
But life is changing.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Things are changing.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000
So it was very disciplined society at that time.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And we were just talking about it.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
It teaches you respect, doesn't it?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
It teaches you respect from being very, very young.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And you carry that respect everywhere you go.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And whatever you do, whether it's work, whether it's school, whether it's play, all of that.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
But it's different now.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
It's not the same.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
How different is it now?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
How different?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
There is no tolerance.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
I think there is no tolerance.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Everybody is punching on you.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Because you are a human being, if you say something, you don't know how they will take it.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Because you've got to be trying to please everyone.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And if you think something is wrong, you can't say nothing.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Like in our society, if somebody from the next door neighbour, if they saw us,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000
we are doing something wrong, they come to us and say, listen, stop it now.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And that was enough for us.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
But nowadays, I can't even say anything to my own children, children, because they don't like it.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
So that's the difference.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
They haven't got any tolerance, any patience.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
They want everything according to their own wishes.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I agree.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000
You were speaking about how your family used to gather.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Joint family.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Joint family system.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
What kind of traditions and celebrations do you remember?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000
It is, joint family system in one way, it is excellent.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
But there are other difficulties as well.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
When I came here.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Sorry, at home.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
At home is different.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Can you speak about that please?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:42.000
At home is different because you are living in that system and you accept everything.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Because you are used to it.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:54.000
For example, if I'm living with my uncle or aunties, they are more responsible than my parents towards me.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And I know if they are stopping me from something, it's actually their duty.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And it's my duty as well to respect their views.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
So that was the joint family system.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
They care about us.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
For example, if mom and dad gone somewhere, they look after us.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
My grandmother or my aunties, they are like our own mothers.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
There is no difference between your parents and your aunties.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
I respect that.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
But there are a few things that are unacceptable in the joint family system.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Now, not at that time, because I was little and I think it's right.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Now I think it's too much because one or two people are struggling to live in that society.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
To live in the joint family system, but they are forced to live there.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
So I wouldn't live on my own.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:59.000
I find it very, because when I came here, my mother-in-law, my three sisters-in-law, my one brother-in-law,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
we were nine or eight people in the same house.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:10.000
And I never feel any difference, but there was complication as well.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Criticizing all the time, expecting you to do so much.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Sometimes you are not capable, you are not feeling well, but you've got to please them.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So there are good things and bad things about the joint family system.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
But I liked it.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
So what made you come to the UK?

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
I married. My husband was my mother's first cousin.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And I married to him.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
There was only three or four years difference.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
So I was engaged to him when I was twelve years old.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:57.000
And then when I was twenty-five, he came here in 1960s, I think.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And then after fifteen years, he went back.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
And I finished all my education and everything, so I married him.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And I came in 1975 to this country.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Did you study as well when you were here?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:27.000
I went to Bristol Uni for a couple of courses because while I was working,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:36.000
I was a teacher and then I went for different courses to improve my qualification as well.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Because my qualification was from back home.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:49.000
And there was one year course for approval of my qualification.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:56.000
So I had done that. And then after that, I was a qualified teacher.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Before that, they were paying me unqualified status.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
So yes, I went for the study.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:11.000
And then I taught in Nash College as well for two years, A level, Urdu.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
So when did you come to Newport?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
When I came to Newport, 1975.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Ah, okay. So you came straight to Newport.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Straight here and since then, I'm still here.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:33.000
I see, I see. So what was the most important thing that you had to leave behind?

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:42.000
My parents. After my marriage, three years after my father passed away,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:50.000
very young, because I think he was about 45 or something, he had breast cancer.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:57.000
And I couldn't go. After his death, I thought there is no point going now.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
I called my mother. My mother was here, but she wasn't happy here.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
So she stayed for a couple of months and then she went back.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:13.000
So yes, my friends, my status as well, because I was a lecturer back home.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
And when I came here, I was just a housewife for 18 years.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:29.000
The most thing which I missed, everybody knows me, Jimmy Khan's wife.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Nobody knows me, who I was. And that was a very big shock for me.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Adnan's mom, Jimmy's wife, that's all.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
But then I went out. I started teaching and everything.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And now they recognize me by my own personality, my own name.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
And my recognition was approved.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Thank you. How did you get here? Was it by sea or by air?

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
How did you get into the UK? Was it by plane or by a bus?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
I came from Kabul by plane.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
You know how much was the ticket at that time? 80 pounds.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
80 pounds was the ticket.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Return ticket 80 pounds.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
So then what was the best thing about the journey?

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Only having my husband. Because I love my husband.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Apart from that, I don't think I like anything here.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
At the beginning, now it's my home.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
But it was a big shock. A casual shock.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Lifestyle, language, because it doesn't matter how educated you are,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
but when you come here, the accent and the language was a barrier.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:06.000
So it took a long time for me to achieve all this.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Was there something easy? What was the easiest thing to get used to when you were here?

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
At that time, I don't think, because you're young, you don't think like that.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
I never thought of that, because I think I was much better over there.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Now it's different because my health is deteriorating and then I think,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
oh, NHS is alright, the doctor's approach is alright, because Pakistan is getting worse.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Opposite now. So the difference is now.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:52.000
But at that time, I don't think, no, personally, I wasn't happy when I came.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Nobody to talk, nobody to share your experience.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
I was very lonely when I came here.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:08.000
And because you are a man, it's different for you, but for a woman,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
living with in-laws, it's a very hard job.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:19.000
I used to sit in my room, in the window, and cry for hours and hours,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
because there was nobody who can I talk to.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
It was very, very difficult.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
So at that time, no, I don't think I was impressed.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.000
I couldn't communicate with my parents, because letter writing was,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
it took 15 days from here to send a letter.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000
And if they give me answer on the spot, another 15 days.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
So in one month, we received one letter, and sometime,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.000
this letter disappeared during the posting.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000
So it was very hard, very hard. It wasn't easy.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Where in Newport did you live?

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Harrow Road.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
But you know the mosque?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:20.000
So what started to help you getting used to the place around that time?

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
What was helping you?

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Nothing. I was so naive, I didn't realize.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Nowadays, the girls come, they know everything, they go out.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
I thought after the bridge, you know the Harrow Road bridge,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
everything is finished.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Never go out, never talk to anybody, because the language communication.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:50.000
I speak Pashto, and I speak Urdu, while the whole community, they are Punjabi speaker.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
So, and I was so scared to talk to them, because if I say something,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:02.000
perhaps it will pass on to my in-laws, and they'll say, oh, you talk to them.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.000
I didn't know if I'm in trouble, where shall I go?

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:17.000
But God helped me during that time, because my husband was a very nice, good person,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000
and he was like a pillar for me, a support.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
So I didn't need anyone. I used to talk to him.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:34.000
I know they were upside down, but nobody else was there.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:42.000
And around that time, of course, because it's early, there's not that many services and things like that just yet.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
No, no.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
So then, as you started to get older, and you're studying,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
this is when you were studying and getting your qualification, isn't it?

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
After you got your qualification, what did you do then, what happened?

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Actually, when I underestimated myself for a long period,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:14.000
when I applied for the job, teaching job, I thought I wouldn't be able to get it.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:22.000
And it was in 1992.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.000
But when they selected me, I couldn't believe it.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:40.000
I got the job, and then I thought, oh, I won't be, because, again, the language, it was accent and everything.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
And I thought, oh, it's very hard.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
I told my husband, I said, I shouldn't be going for it.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:55.000
And he said, no, go on. And if you don't like it, you can quit.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:02.000
So the first day I went, and after that, for 27 years, I was stuck there.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:14.000
And I was highly qualified, because I had got my BA in psychology, history, and Urdu.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Then I had done my master in Urdu. Then I had done my BA Bachelor of Education.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:31.000
So, in my two years' lecturership experience, everything.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:40.000
But, again, it's low confidence, because living with the in-laws, they put me under everything.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.000
You can't do nothing, you can't do nothing, you can't do nothing. And that was, I convinced myself.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:57.000
But then, it's like, after I achieved whatever I wanted, I came off to the shelf slowly and gradually.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:07.000
So, lots of confidence. But still, my husband was very, very, you can say, too much supportive.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:14.000
He never let me face the reality of the life. Whatever I asked, oh, how you could do this?

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Don't worry, I'll do it for you.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:24.000
So that was after he passed away nearly nine years now, eight years now.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Now I realize I need so many things to know, which in his presence, I never tried.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Because he was doing everything for me. And my children are the same now. They are doing it for me. Mom will do it.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:50.000
So, I think now I'm learning more than before.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Can I ask about another friend? Who was your first friend? Besides your husband, of course. Who was your first friend?

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Here?

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Yeah.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:15.000
I'm sorry to say that. They are people, I know them. I can't call them friends.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Friends are those who are in bad or good. They are with you.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:37.000
I got these different groups and joining them, but I can't call them, you know, like in English word, yes, you can call them friend.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:51.000
But our cultural background, I got only one friend, which is in Pakistan, and she lives a thousand miles away from me.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:58.000
But if I call her, I need this, she'll say, okay. I call her a friend.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:11.000
So, they are good people. We are meeting every day. We are joining our different celebrations and everything.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:24.000
But those are the people, I know them, they know me. I'm sorry, but I can't call them friends. Am I right or wrong?

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
I think you're right.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Because, you know, we can pass some time with them. I can understand that. But I can't call them when I need them.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Or they can't call me when they need me. Perhaps it's me. Not them, they are openly, but I am so hesitant to go forward and say, oh, she's my friend, she'll do it for me.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:07.000
No, I still, I got, there is a reluctant, what if I ask for something and they deny? No, so the best thing is not to ask.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:18.000
You know, because these small things which you think make you a friendship, no, I don't think so. Yes, they are nice people. They are good.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:28.000
They are good. We are meeting each other every day. We are sharing our happiness. We are sharing our sorrows. But friend is something different.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
That's my definition of a friendship. Perhaps I'm very extremist.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
No, it makes sense. I think it makes sense. Yes.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Speaking about a friend at home. I can't trust anyone. That's the problem.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000
How did you keep in touch? Are you still in touch with your friend in Pakistan, of course?

00:28:51.000 --> 00:29:04.000
I, every other, you can say every 15 days, I ring her. And if she rang me, if she won't hear from me, she phoned me. So we are in contact.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:14.000
You know, I'll give you one example. My husband passed away. We bought a house there in Pakistan. And there was installment given to him.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:27.000
And she realized and she said, Jahan, now your husband is gone. I don't think you'll be able to come here and live here.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:34.000
What's the point buying a house here? I said, yes, you're right. I said, what can I do? She said, don't worry.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:44.000
So she sold my house. She put the money on the side. When I went there, she said, here's your house money. You can keep it.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:51.000
So you can call a best friend there. Otherwise I'd be lumbered up with all that.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:30:02.000
I used to have accounts there. She closed every account. She said, look, we are the same age. I don't know how long I will live.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:14.000
I don't want after me that you'll have problem. She got one daughter and she said, here's your money, here's your only account, every detail. She said, that's yours.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:23.000
So after finding a friend like that, then you're comparing with others. It's not the same. So we are in touch all the time.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:32.000
I was in the fifth class, which is, I think, about 10 years old. And we are friends up to now.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
That's why that makes sense. It makes a lot of sense.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:50.000
If we can talk about traditions, is there any traditions that you've kept here while you're here?

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Preserved, are there traditions that you've made an effort to make sure they stay with you and you share with the younger generation, with your kids as well?

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:08.000
There are lots of traditions, but I think it's very hard to keep them.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:27.000
When I was young, my problem is I'm very open. I won't say anything which does not comply with my lifestyle.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:39.000
When I was young, I used to respect all the traditions, everything. But now, by the passing of time, the children are growing.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:57.000
I think it's very hard. It is very hard because sometimes I think other Asian people won't agree with that.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:06.000
But I think it's very hard to force my children to my old tradition.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:21.000
I'd love to ask them to follow it, but if they can't, because they haven't seen that culture, they haven't seen that society,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:28.000
expecting from them to behave in that way is very hard.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:41.000
So, for example, mixed marriages, whether you call it racist or bias or whatever it is, it's very hard.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:48.000
But now is the time you've got to accept it. You can do nothing.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:57.000
I would like to be very religious. Some people are lucky. They can do it.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:11.000
But I think it's imposing on them. It's not working or forcing them to accept something which they are not familiar with.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Religion is alright, but other things. And I don't think I'm that traditional person. I don't think so.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:32.000
You know, you have to change with the time, with the situation.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:43.000
So apart from that, it's only like Eid or our religious things, Ramazan. I follow them, and I'm a good example.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:50.000
If they learn from me, yes. If they can't, I can't force them.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Because the more you're forcing someone, the more they start hating it, because they think that you are putting something on them which they don't like.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:12.000
So giving them a good example and expecting that they will learn, respect for others, yes, definitely.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:20.000
I can't stand any disrespect. I respect everyone and I want them to respect me.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:31.000
So respect, respect the elder and respect your views, respect other people's views.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:40.000
I think by the passing of time, I'm changing a lot. I'm learning, we've got to do this, we've got to do this.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Can you talk about Eid or Ramazan or celebrations at home when you were younger?

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Oh, it's different. It's lovely over there, yes.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Because over there, if it's Ramazan, even in Pakistan, different parts are celebrating in different ways.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Like in Punjab, they openly eat everything if they are not fasting.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:21.000
In Peshawar, for 30 days, they don't open the shops. The shops are closed.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:28.000
And if you've got a child in the house and if he's hungry, you can't go to the shop and you can't buy anything.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Because they know it's Ramazan and you shouldn't be coming out for the food.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
While in Punjab, they are not that strict.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:49.000
So I think, especially in our area, they are very strict.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:58.000
In Ramazan, each celebration is you are going to your uncle, auntie's houses, different colored clothes.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000
If you wear different colored clothes here outside, everybody will be looking at you, but you're wrong.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:12.000
So yes, it's more interesting, more beautiful way of celebrating.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:20.000
But now we are doing it here as well. Like we had recently in Coffee and Love, we had a lovely party, Eid party.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:29.000
There in Cardiff, they are celebrating Eid Mela. So, yes.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000
What was it like in your grandmother's house as well?

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.000
What was it like in your grandmother's house in celebrations or when your aunties used to come over and when your uncles used to come over?

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:50.000
In Ramazan, actually, we are up before the dawn and we eat whatever we like.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:57.000
For example, nowadays the children are more modern. They are having porridge or vita biks.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:09.000
But in Pakistan, you make paratha, which is flat bread with butter in it and all this heavy food, which they don't eat.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:17.000
Fruit, tea, coffee, light breakfast.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Because if you do your breakfast, then you won't be able to sleep or anything.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:39.000
So then is the Fajr Namaz, pray, first pray. After that, we don't eat anything till the dusk, you can say, until the sun sets.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:48.000
And then, if you look at it, Ramazan means a simple lifestyle.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:59.000
But we are making a feast out of it, like making picores and making kebabs and this and that.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:09.000
Actually, it's not that. You should have something simple, food, which you can digest properly.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:19.000
So in my house, when they were young, I used to do everything. But now, it's only me and my daughter. We are living together.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:28.000
I'm not fasting because I'm diabetic, insulin dependent. And she is fasting.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.000
So she wakes up in the morning, she had breakfast, whatever, a piece of bread and cup of tea.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
And in the night, just whatever is ready, she cooks, she eats that.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:45.000
But some people, where they got little children or big family, they got a big feast.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
That's the way they celebrate their Ramazan.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:55.000
It didn't mean that they eat less, but they eat so much and then they end up in the bed.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000
But five times pray is essential for Ramazan.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.000
They eat so much that they are unable to pray.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:11.000
Not necessarily about Ramadan, but mostly about Pathan and about Pakistan.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Can you remember the music? What was the music like growing up when you were younger?

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:23.000
I used to listen to the music and my music was on a big blast in my room.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:30.000
And people next door, they were, come on, turn it down, turn it down. I was young, I never realized that.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Yeah, it's all Indian music, Pakistani music, razzle, lovely music.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:45.000
It's not the instrument, it's the wording.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
I always liked the wording, the poetry, good poetry.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000
So this type of music I liked.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000
And our Pathan, they got their traditional music.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:06.000
That is something different with the Dhaaf and Dholki.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
It's a two-sided drum type thing.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
So colorful clothes and...

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
You're singing like a Thondule?

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Dholki we call it Dholak.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000
So then has it changed? Has music changed now?

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:33.000
No, I don't think so. But in those days, every hotel, they got gramophone,

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000
and with a full blast gramophone, industry, everything.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
But now I notice there's change now. They won't do that now. I don't know why.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000
But have they got the television?

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:50.000
So instead of listening to the music, they are more interested in watching the television. Yeah.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Just this last section now.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Have you kept any kind of family heirlooms, family photographs or ornaments?

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Have we got them?

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000
Yeah, have you kept any?

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:11.000
Not few, very little number of photographs yet.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Because in those days, camera was very expensive.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
And we used to go to the studio.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Five rupees, which is I think 0.5,

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
pence you can say.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:34.000
And all these in the front of the photograph are like this, or like holding your hand.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Yes, I got few. Yeah.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Why are they important to you?

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Because those are my parents.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000
I got my dad's photo.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000
I got my mom's photograph.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000
I got my uncle and auntie's.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
My childhood photograph, when I was 12 I think.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000
So it's emotional.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Are we okay to use them as part of the People's Collection as well?

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Is there any?

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000
It's in my album.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Yeah, if you're able to bring some or arrange a time that we can take photos of them and use them as part of the...

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
Yeah, no problem.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Thank you.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000
And then is there anything else you'd like to share at all?

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:25.000
No, it's lovely questions.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
It reminds me a lot of things.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000
And good memories.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
And that's all.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Thank you very much.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Thank you.
