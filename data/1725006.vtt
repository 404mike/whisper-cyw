00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
Have you had boyfriends in the past?

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.600
I have had a boyfriend.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.040
Well, I've had two boyfriends.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.840
I had one at school, in junior school.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:28.000
And I had a boyfriend before coming over here.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.720
Do you feel comfortable to tell us a little bit about...

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.600
I still to this day really like this person that I went out with.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.440
I worked with him in a workshop.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.400
But the unfortunate thing is that my parents don't like him at all.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.400
I don't know why.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.520
They've just got something against him.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.720
And we are still in touch.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.520
Although my parents aren't very happy about it.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.760
We are still talking.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.320
Which I really like, but it's not...

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.640
We're not talking enough.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.960
And I would like for him to come over here.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:28.000
But again, my parents find out and I'll have my head chopped off.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.480
So you don't know why your parents don't approve?

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.480
No.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.160
And how long were you together?

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:45.040
We were together for two years.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.920
And I was very, very happy.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.800
It's just my parents didn't approve.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:01.280
And it took me a long time to get over him.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.360
To the point where I wasn't eating.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.360
I didn't want to see anyone.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.960
I just wanted to be on my own.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.320
I was crying every night.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.280
But I suppose that's how life is.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.280
And life goes on.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.280
Must have been hard.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.280
Very, very hard.
