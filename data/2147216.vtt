WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So you caught him here.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hmm.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Am I okay?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Yeah.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
President's fine.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Huh?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You're good.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Magnificent.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Yeah, yeah, but I want to make sure.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I don't want, because she's the first one who's going to tell me where,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
you couldn't get somebody to just do that, or fix that, or drag that, or.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Hmm.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Yeah.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We'll go start there, if you give us an introduction to yourself, please.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Yes.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Ready?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Okay.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
My name is Roy Grant.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I was born in Jamaica and came to the United Kingdom at the age of 19 years of age.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I had a wonderful childhood marred by affliction, but of a good, good parentage.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
My parents sent me here to the United Kingdom at the age of 19,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000
because after leaving school, I loved to do engineering, and I began my engineering apprenticeship.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Arriving in this country, oh my goodness, what a change.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And so much, so different from what I'm used to.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Cold wind, my hands, my fingers numbed, my body shivers.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And I arrived in Southampton by a ship called the SSB Gona, 11 days a night aboard the ship,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
which wasn't a very nice experience.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000
But when I arrived at Southampton, we got on a train to Victoria, and then from Victoria,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I went to Birmingham and there to live with my cousin.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I spent the first week getting used to the family I now become, to adopt,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and the home that is going to be my own for no, well, in fact,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.000
on my application to come to this country, I had to put on it, I'll be here for five years.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So, at that point, I would have been, all my intention that I was going to spend five years in the country,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and then I'll be going back to Jamaica.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
However, I had the first week to get used to the place as it were,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and the family that was about to adopt me as their own.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And after a week, I was taken to what they call the labour exchange in those days,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.000
which is the employment department, the job centre, which is now known as,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and sign on for a job.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And at the same time, I was purchasing the evening news to see what vacancies were available.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Anyway, between these two outlets, I saw quite a number of vacancies for apprentices for engineering,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and I thought, this is great, I wouldn't have a problem here.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:55.000
However, I would send for applications, and applications would come along,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
but in them days, the post was pretty good.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And furthermore, in some of these notices for engineers, there used to be a little write in there,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:20.000
which you fill in, and you get through to the engineer works that you seek out very quickly.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Anyway, when I received some sort of confirmation that my request was being looked at,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and I fill in these applications, send them back, they would quickly send to me and say,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
well, come in for an interview.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And this is the strangest thing is, when I remember speaking to one or two people at this job,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:09.000
at the works, and they were so enthusiastic about me, because my English wasn't any different from what it is now.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:18.000
So they wouldn't realize that I was black, and it was just a matter of Bromie English,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
because it's not really straight English in many places.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And they say, come in. But when I got there, and two words, you know, where do you live? I said.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.000
How long have you been in the country? I said, well, a month.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And then they say, well, who did you learn your engineering with? I say, in Jamaica.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I say, well, I'm sorry, but we can't have you because you have a broken apprenticeship.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And I was turned down, dreadful.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And this repeat itself on several occasions. So I was really fed up.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
In fact, what is the worst thing about this discriminative attitude?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:31.000
I remember going to the door of a few engineering places, and in those days, they had a window like a hatchet.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And like a hatchet, you slide this hatchet door open, and the receptionist or whoever it is speak to you.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And I remember walking up to the door, and the door was in a position where you could see the hatchet window.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And I could see the lady sitting at the desk looking out through the hatchet window to see who was coming through the door.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And as soon as she sees me, the hatchet went, clunk, shuts tight.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And she walked away and shut the door behind her in her room because they didn't want any black people.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:26.000
It later come to my knowledge that, you see, engineering or precision engineering in the 60s were the rose-roised trade for the poor man,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.000
those who couldn't send their kids to university or who didn't pass the 11 plus.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And for a black man to take those spaces was very rare.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Furthermore, the workers or the tradesmen who have a boy child who would want to continue being an engineer would put their names down,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.000
just like they used to do in the schools, would put their names on as a child so that when they leave school, they go straight into that engineering work.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.000
So you have father, grandfather, grandchildren, all family in that engineering.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Well, I was so fed up that I wrote to my cousin who lived in Wales, and I told her what the situation was,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and, you know, it's discrimination and nobody wants to give me a job because I wasn't intent to do anything else.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And she said, no, as far as she's concerned, people in Wales are very, very nice, they're very cooperative and so on.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
So come down. And I came to Wales.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
How old were you?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:09.000
When I came to Wales, I came to Wales on the, yes, I came to Wales, I can remember now, the last week in July, 1962, and just on my 20th birthday.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And it was what they call the two weeks shut down holiday, the summer holidays.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And the newspaper came out, which was the, I can't remember if it's the Echo or the August, came out or the early August,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
and I read it and it says, engineer apprentice wanted.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And I didn't stop to think, I just, and there was a telephone number, and I picked up and I rang.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And this gentleman said to me, yes, we want an apprentice, we want apprentices, you know, if you want to come along.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:06.000
I went and I saw the form and because at this engineering work, which was grinding engineering,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and he said to me, yes, but I can't give you the yes today.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.000
You have to come back a following week and see the owner and they will give you yes.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Well, I went back the following week and you wouldn't believe it.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I was on top form because they said yes, I, they would take me on.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
I was so pleased.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And that was the beginning of my future as an engineering, position engineering apprenticeship in Wales.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000
So I am grateful to come into Wales because I succeed in doing what I set out to do.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Now you have been working in engineering, you have grown up.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:09.000
When did your wife or your fiance come over?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Well, in those early days, what the government, the government was stopping everyone from coming.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
But if you have dependent relatives or your fiance, they could come.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:36.000
However, for fiancees, fiancees could come with one premises that you have to get married within three months of arriving in the country.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:46.000
And so it wasn't long before I put everything I could together to send for my fiance.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And the following year in 1963, she came and we got married in December of that year.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Well, it wasn't long after we made our life together and we ended up having four kids, wonderful children.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:14.000
One girl and three boys, well, plus one other boy, make five kids.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And yes, however, I don't know if this interview is the right place to do it, but I have to tell you this.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Whenever everyone who succeeds, every black person who came here during the 60s and succeed in doing anything that is very important,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
they have to sacrifice something.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:13:04.000
And unfortunately, my family, unwittingly, I sacrificed my family to develop my engineering skill because I have to work twice as hard as the white man.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And I had to be twice as clever as the white man because within a short time, the introduction of nylon to the manufacturing industry, especially textile,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
create the need for wrapping cutting tools.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:38.000
And I was the man who was rushed to develop that wrapping cutting tool in tungsten carbide,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000
which makes the company and a lot of other people very rich.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:58.000
But I was a nobody to the English. I was black. I wasn't rich.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Furthermore, I have no right to say, to have any say in the development as what would I think in saying I could take ownership of the fact that this is what I've done as evidence.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:29.000
No, everything was pointed out to the ownership of the owner of that engineering.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:47.000
So I can only say it with conviction that I've done it, but I cannot embrace a certificate to say, well, this is what I have done and I can be and I am satisfied that I've been compensated.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:15:03.000
No, but I feel good because engineering is what I love and I have done it so no one can take that away from me.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
When you say Wales, where are you?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Wales, well, I say that I talk about Birmingham carries a lot of treated me with resentment and discrimination.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:28.000
It doesn't mean to say that there is not there wasn't discrimination and resentment in Wales.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:40.000
There was, but it was undermined a lot different from in Birmingham.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Birmingham, it was on the doorstep. In Wales, it's under the carpet.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And the different was a subtlety because, for instance, during my engineering work and I was developing this stuff so rapidly and to compensate me and to keep me within that work environment so that I wouldn't be poached or go anywhere else.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:20.000
I was rapidly promoted from charging to foreman to production manager.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:31.000
And I remember, you know, one of the men who made friends with me and he was the one who gave me the first cup of tea.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And he said, he went to the, this is what the foreman told me after the event.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:59.000
And he apparently he told the foreman, he went to the foreman and asked the foreman if this black bastard come to give me authority, a job or what should I do?

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:06.000
And the foreman was looked at him and this is what and I quote what they are saying.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:14.000
The foreman said, when I give you a job to do, what do you do?

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:23.000
And he answered, he carried it out. So he said, you know that I'm a Polish man.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:30.000
He said, yes. So the foreman answered and said, well, what is the difference?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:38.000
And the strangest thing is I did not know anything about this that went on.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:52.000
It was only when the foreman then took me in his confident and advised me to be very careful and to be very straight with everyone.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Don't give anyone the right, the chance to build up any resentment against me.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:14.000
And he start to share out all these things that might affect me, might affect my project, my progress, you know, in becoming a good boss as it were then.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
When was then the next turning point?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000
The next turning point is I reached a production manager.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:32.000
I've been having to and this is the this is this is the underline of the discrimination comes in.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:41.000
They brought in five different other people to take on the job that I have been doing.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:50.000
In other words, to to manage me in the work and set them up as production manager.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:58.000
And then I had to teach those guys what to tell me what to do.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:07.000
It was ridiculous. So after a time, I just got fed up and I said, well, I'm changing my arm.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:20.000
I'm changing from engineering and I went into into taxi proprietary and I was a taxi proprietor for over five years.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
And and, you know, it was very successful.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:45.000
But there again, to make it successful, I sacrifice a lot of time building it because I was black and no one wants to to call a black taxi man to take their their daughter to church on the way for their wedding and all like that or to take them out when they're properly dressed.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
No one wants a black man to drive them or.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
And it takes a while to build up the business.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:05.000
And do you and during that time, I sometime have neglected my children because when they want me to take them to sports and so on.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:12.000
So I was busy working to, you know, and helping somebody else or something like that.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:21.000
So I have I have a lot of regret in the fact that I did not.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
I did not equate the important.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
And this is what I'm telling you guys.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:45.000
No matter how much you want something, when you have a family, try to mesh what you're doing that is equally divided between what you want and what your family is required of you.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Because it can come back to bite you on the ass.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:57.000
And I'm not saying my kids resent me now, but they could, you know.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:04.000
They they they it's hard to forget.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
You know, I was speaking about the blindness.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Yeah.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Well, I've been being a taxi propriety.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:22.000
It wasn't long after, you know, people take advantage and they smashing up the vehicle left, right and center.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:32.000
And I decided to take a change and that change led me into into.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Develop catering a mobile catering business.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.000
And this mobile catering business was was supplying.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Break break meals, break snacks for the workers, because in those days is very few.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Companies, manufacturers have a canteen whereby, you know, people could go into and.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
And get something to eat.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
They would have to send someone to up to the shop.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:15.000
So it's a it's all, you know, the company would be we would be losing at least three quarter of an hour for the person to go to the shop.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
At least three quarters of an hour every day.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
It's a lot of time over the week.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:29.000
And I was going in and I was taking in all these snacks for these people so that they could stay within the workplace and have their snacks and so on.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
And that went on for a few years and I was very successful at it.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
However, like.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:44.000
The overall of over 20 years of of hard work and and.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Stress.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Create diabetes.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
And the diabetes.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Become so great taking over my body so much that it caused hemorrhage in my right eye and rendered me blind.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Completely blind. Oh, you heard me say my right eye.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000
So what about my left eye? Well, like I said in the beginning.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
I had a good childhood, but it was flawed.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.000
And that's when I was two years of age, I lost sight to an accident in my left eye.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:36.000
So I only had one eye, even though I was insistent on being an engineer and was successful at it.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:44.000
So diabetes cause hemorrhage on the optic nerves in my right eye.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
And I was completely blind.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000
And my my mobile catering business went.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
I could no longer drive.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
And I lost my license.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
I lost my business and.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
I lost my head because the shock.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Look at me and he explained something to you.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
I just I just finished having my Sunday dinner.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:24.000
And we sat at the dinner table and we were all happy having a laugh and a joke.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
And I pick up my pipe because we smoke a pipe.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
I smoke a pipe by then.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
I clean the pipe and in them days, you know, you smoke in the house, you smoke around the table.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
And and I clean my pipe.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:48.000
And no before I could fill my pipe and bend in my head like this, cleaning it out.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:59.000
It's as though I'm looking at a piece of glass like this and somebody drop a tip of well, I didn't know it was blood.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Something red.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000
And it was just flowing over this piece of glass.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000
And it flows and until all I could see was.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Blaring light around the square ends of this glass.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000
And that was it. So I ran in the bathroom, washed my face and all that.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
And there's nothing happening.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
I was so shocked. I don't know.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
How the hell did I get into the bathroom and I couldn't see? I was blind.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
How did I get there?

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.000
But I got there to the bathroom, washed my face and nobody will my aunt.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Until this day, I can't tell you how I got there.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Well, the trauma and that's where the trauma began because I went to the hospital and there was no one there to tell me.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
How am I going to see again or if I will ever see again or they can do anything.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
So I was sent home.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
The following day I went back.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Same thing.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:11.000
And it took three days until the specialist came back from where all the day where he were.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
And he came back and then they begin to panic.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:23.000
And start to phone up all the different hospitals to find out who was the best person to clean.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:32.000
To take away this sort of mushroom thing that left on the optic nerves from the bleeding.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Anyway, it took I think about three weeks or so for the hospital to make an appointment when for this procedure to take place.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
And it did take place.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:59.000
And the first time I went and they done it, which was Moorfield in London.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
It didn't work.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
So disappointed.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
It didn't work.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:15.000
It took another six weeks for them to do this surgery again, once again.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:23.000
And that time this time, the minute they took away the bandage and off my eye.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:30.000
What I can only describe as pink balloon, pink jelly.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:37.000
I was looking through a glass of pink jelly.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:52.000
And from there on, my sight began to get stronger and stronger.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:01.000
And you know, I was discharged and went home.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:08.000
However, I couldn't remember how to pronounce a word.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.000
My brain, I was like, I couldn't write, I couldn't do nothing.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
I couldn't remember things.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
I was like a vegetable.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000
However, it took, it took months.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:41.000
And the advice was to do as much as you can with your eyes so that you will train it to, you will exercise it.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Keep exercising it and get it so that it becomes to strengthen it so it's stronger.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
I don't know whether they were right or wrong.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000
But I was doing it.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:01.000
And I did all the things that they asked me to do to strengthen the muscles in the eye and the eye and all like that.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Until I could see what was happening on the television.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:14.000
And that was, you know, after a few months, that was really, really good news.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
But my brain was something else.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:29.000
However, my children didn't say to me, well, see what happened to you now.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000
They didn't.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
They were there for me.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
And my family were there for me.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
And I'm so grateful to them.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:50.000
So that was the beginning of my, of the real change in my growing, in my life.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Because I have to learn to start living off pension and not able to work.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000
In fact, I can tell you this.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:07.000
1996, I have learned, since 1996, I have learned a pay packet.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
I have learned my hand out for a pay packet.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:29.000
1996 till 2000, till 2000, I was, I was, 1998, 1998 till 2000, I was literally blind.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:43.000
And I was registered blind in 2020, in 1998, because I could no longer drive a car.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
My license was taken away from me.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
I couldn't go anywhere by then.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
I couldn't see in the dark.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Anywhere I go, I have to have someone in me.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:18.000
However, as the site began to develop, my friends, the initiative, Community First Initiative was playing a big role in Wales.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:26.000
As they identified Dufferin, where I live, as one place of high deprivation.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:37.000
And a few people were creating a group to meet, to help, to meet those needs.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
And they asked me to join in.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Now, my speciality is in engineering.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:54.000
And as I have been walking the street before I went blind, and even with the little sight that I had,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:04.000
I used to see those kids take anything they could get all of, whether a piece of iron, a spanner, or a machete.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Well, not so much a machete, but the kitchen knife.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:17.000
And they were hammering and cutting and doing whatever they liked to these precision pieces of engineering.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
And it really grieves me.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:36.000
So I set about and I developed a community psych-care club that teaches the children how to repair their bikes in a safe environment.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:45.000
And also create a psych club to take these kids riding, take them out into the countryside.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
We said, take them out into the countryside for bike ride.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:33:02.000
The council was on board, the police was on board, Alford was on board, and Youth Service was on board.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
So much so.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.000
And then I put a, and this is the big thing, I put a big ad in the Argos to say that if you have an old bike

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000
or something that you no longer use, we will pick it up.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
And we used to pick up these bikes from all over the place.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Furthermore, the police used to have a lot of bikes that people steal and no one claimed them.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000
We used to get those bikes and we used to strip them and use the good parts of them and build up good parts.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
So it was really, really good.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:44.000
So that's where my volunteering service began.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Yeah, alongside volunteering, of course, when, like I said, I was encouraged to exercise my eye.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:12.000
And of course, by exercising my eye, and of course, my brain was all over the place.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:19.000
I couldn't remember things, I couldn't even remember how to pronounce a word and so on and so on.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:27.000
I went back to, I take up the option of going back to the high school during the holiday to learn how to read and write and all like that.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:35.000
And because this obsession to see again, to be back to where I was,

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:45.000
I create an obsession to write, to strengthen my eye and to get my brain into gear.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:52.000
And this becomes, or it became a real obsession to write.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
I just could not stop writing.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
And the more I write, well, the better it became.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:09.000
And today, I can tell, you know, for those who don't know,

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000
if you were to look under the heading of Roy McPenfield,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:21.000
you will have some idea of the number of books, novels that I've written, plays,

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:37.000
plays that have been performed in Pill Millenium, New Seasons Church, Burleigh Academy, Riverfront, Doleman Theatre.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Yeah. So quite a number of plays and quite a number of magazines,

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
quite a number of books I have written.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:36:06.000
However, again, once the obsession take hold, family gets squeezed.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:18.000
And so I don't know if I never learned, but was I selfish?

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:30.000
But there was no one there to point and say, well, either you never learn or you're unselfish.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000
I just did what I felt I had to do.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:52.000
And so, whilst I'm doing all these, whilst the need to write, I began, and like I said,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:59.000
they said to write a story of my journey.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:07.000
I wrote that story. I was so pleased to do it in the first place.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:20.000
And then I've been joined another group, which was the Black Heritage Association,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Kumere, which is an offspring to the Southeast Race Relations Council,

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:40.000
and sister to Gabo, which is a grant association for volunteer.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:48.000
And at the time, there was a then chair.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Usually at the end of each year, they would have a celebration function,

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:04.000
or so many times a year they have a sort of what they call a concert, and people would tell stories.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:11.000
And Lester would record these stories.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Now, being as I was in that state of obsessive writing, I went to Lester and I said,

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Lester, I will write, I will record and write these stories,

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
regardless of the fact that you are doing it on tape.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Because if we are doing these stories for the generation in the future,

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.000
it's not going to be easy for them to get to the tape that you are keeping there,

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:48.000
because you will be only bringing those tapes out once a year.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Furthermore, those tapes, if more than one person is using those tapes, they get broken, they get, you know,

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:05.000
and only a limited number of people could see those tapes at any given time.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:16.000
If you have it written, it can be seen by a lot of people more often,

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:25.000
and it can be easily transported, and mothers and parents can read it to their children,

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000
you know, their stories, or the children can read it to their friends,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:40.000
and it will be better transportable, and it will serve for a longer time.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
And everybody agreed with that.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:51.000
And I set about with, what do you call it, is it Omega? No.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:40:06.000
I set about with a little handheld recorder, and I managed to do 16 recordings.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000
However, let me tell you something, bro.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:18.000
It was very difficult having people to tell any stories at all.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
People did not want to tell their stories.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:30.000
You see, black people have been so down-beaten and trod,

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:38.000
that they didn't want to start raking up any stories of how they might feel, or how they were treated,

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:47.000
or the situation from which they came, because they want to pursue a different life.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:55.000
And it's not like today, when nobody is ashamed to say, well, my parents are poor.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Years ago, you don't want to tell anyone that your parents are poor,

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.000
because they would treat you worse than how they should have.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:12.000
So therefore, in those days, people didn't like to talk about they were poor,

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:20.000
or their life story, or they didn't get the education that is now people take for granted.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000
So therefore, it was very difficult.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.000
But anyway, I persist, and I did 16 stories.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:36.000
And the 16 stories created the first literature exhibition in Newport

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:43.000
for the 2010 celebration at the library.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:56.000
The year when the Ryder Cup and Newport celebrate the most prestigious event of all time,

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:06.000
you had, because it was the year when Barack Obama becomes president, and he visited Newport.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:13.000
So you can imagine, it was a wonderful time.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:22.000
And all these stories, and all these books, and all the things that I've done, don't forget, they are all in the library.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000
You can go there, and you can see them.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:41.000
And my story is packed to the rafter within all the establishments, like the Aberystwyth and so on.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:51.000
So that is the highlight, as it were, then.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:43:01.000
However, at the same time, like I said before, the Welsh government bringing the Community First initiative,

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:11.000
at the same time, there was no provision for black minority ethnic, 50 plus, all minority ethnic people.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:18.000
There was a little bit of provision for what they call a Young People's Partnership Board,

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000
which was primarily dealing with the Somalis.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:30.000
But there was nothing for black people, especially Caribbean people.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:47.000
And at that point in time, when it was Giavro who was the lead in presenting the case,

00:43:47.000 --> 00:44:06.000
that achieved some funding for both the Somali people and with the church and other groups trying to get funding,

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:13.000
or some recognition for the plight of minority ethnic people.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:23.000
They were lucky, and the Welsh government decided, yes, we will recognize minority ethnic people.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:29.000
And they wanted evidence.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000
And David Phillips.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000
No, first of all, it was Omar Ali.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:55.000
He did a study on the Somali people and the situation and their condition and the need for some sort of funding and help.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:09.000
And then when the Welsh government decided that right overall, Community First is needed to acknowledge these people need some help,

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:27.000
David Phillips was asked to present a study, and he used the Omar Ali present survey plus the survey of Newport as a whole and minority ethnic.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:45.000
And that was presented to the Welsh government by Robert Lenbeck and Brian Hadash and Willem, is it Willem?

00:45:45.000 --> 00:46:13.000
The then manager for Giavro, and they successfully had five people to carry out seminars, five workers to carry out seminars to identify the shortfall, the need.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:22.000
That was the need that was created for help for people in community.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:30.000
And so you add in health, you add in housing, you add in education and so on, make five people.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:53.000
And like I said, whilst I was carrying out the writing of the 16 storybooks for Caribbean people, I had an application.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:05.000
I was given an application from SUREC at the time and the BBC wanted application for membership to their council.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:24.000
It was called the BBC Broadcasting Corporation.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Anyway, it was the governance unit and I was in the governance unit, I was in governance for five years.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:46.000
And within that five years, there was discussion about people with least voice.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:53.000
And I thought this is something new and this is something that I like to do.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:14.000
And so when the seminars take place and the search for the different bodies of different people who needed to have a voice, I joined the seminars.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:23.000
And 50 plus network was created in 2008.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:34.000
And in 2008, the black minority 50 plus network was created through GAVO.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:40.000
And I was a part of that, I was part of that group.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:49:09.000
And we done the training and we done the introduction and they given us, because what the Welsh Government wanted, the Welsh Government did not want a support worker or what you call worker to lead people.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:29.000
They wanted people to lead or to carry out what their main, to address their needs, to say what they want, to give people a voice.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:37.000
And so I was very interested in people letting their voices heard.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:45.000
So then how do we get from the black minority, I think, from the 50s group network to the black minority?

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:59.000
Yeah, and this is the heart of this conversation here, is that in 2008, like I said, the group was created.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:10.000
And in 2009, but 2008, 2009, I was still working on those 16 books for the 2010 thing.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:21.000
But in 2009, I was elected chair for the group, even though I was still working on a, didn't mean to say that my eye was better.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:29.000
And I was back to square one. I was still doing damage into my eye, but I was obsessed.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:42.000
And the problem is all the people at that time, nobody had the experience of running a group except for Vanessa.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:51.000
All the other people, they were all people who have interest in the community or in business also.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:57.000
But to run a group, it was a different matter. So I was elected chair.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:05.000
And of course, being elected chair, I had to create all the paperwork.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:21.000
Everything was, I created everything in the first, between, well, while I was doing the exhibition and all that,

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.000
I was still working on the creation of the group.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:45.000
Because you see, if you were to look at the 2010 celebration, that will be the 2010 celebration, it's booklets, an exhibition, which you find in the library.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:57.000
It plays a big role in the group creation, because the same, most of the people within the group were part of that exhibition.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:05.000
So was the Somali young people. And so they both grew up together.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:24.000
And age alive come into force in 2012, because after the 2010 exhibition, and black minority ethnic 50 plus people begin to like what they see,

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:32.000
all of these people coming together each week and discussing what they want and what they don't want.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:40.000
What happened is that we decided, well, it was probably me.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:59.000
I put it to the membership that already you have five different groups, which is black minority ethnic, so and so for health, so and so black minority ethnic for education, black minority ethnic for.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:12.000
So I said, this is too complicated. It's going to cause mix-ups. So let's change our name. Let's model our name and give ourselves a brand.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:23.000
So all sorts of names, I put all sorts of names, all sorts of names comes up and we opt for age alive.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:49.000
Age alive, two little word, which means respect for the individual, regardless of religion or ethnicity, preference, black or white, brown or whatever.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:54.000
Yeah, doesn't matter. Respect for the individual is what matters.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:05.000
If you can't respect the individual, you cannot accept the individual as an individual. You have to respect that.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:11.000
And so that is age alive was born on respect.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:20.000
And so we created age alive. And that was my. That was my.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:33.000
That again is another obsession. That was my obsession to make it successful.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:42.000
And I am. And again, once again, I have to be thankful to my children.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:49.000
They didn't run the street and say my dad is not my dad because he don't do anything for me.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.000
He do it doing it for other people and not for me.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:03.000
You know, and I am so grateful to them for putting up with me doing so much stuff for other people.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:08.000
And they didn't get what they supposed to have.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:18.000
So age alive has got the best of my the best years of my life.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:32.000
And age I have I have with a few other with a few other dedicated people carry the membership through to a very successful end.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:42.000
Well, not a very successful end to a very successful place where we can sit down and we can talk about our stories.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:52.000
Age alive have created the platform where Asian people can tell their story,

00:55:52.000 --> 00:56:02.000
knowing that their their contribution to society is being given a worthwhile platform.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:12.000
Well, the one thing that the one thing that I think is very important to me,

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:23.000
and I think it's very important to me, is that the age of age alive is very important to me.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:38.000
Well, the one thing that the one thing that I I I feel I failed in,

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:49.000
I failed in not being able to have more of the male group within the male within the group.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:59.000
I failed. I I feel I have failed because although we started with four male people in the group,

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:06.000
we it's gently petered down to just me.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:22.000
And what the real cause for that is it is too young to tap that cause to to to to the dismantle

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:28.000
the philosophy behind the reason why male don't that too much in depth.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:35.000
You know, it's a cultural thing for which I which I would not want to interfere.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.000
It does for another generation.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:45.000
But that is my only failure as far as I'm concerned.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:57.000
But I am also thankful to the old souls, the family for giving those people who are members of age alive

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.000
the opportunity to have their voices heard.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:13.000
This is the the the the biggest triumph of this group for those people to have their voices heard,

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:23.000
because no one no one of those people in age members Asian men in in in can have can speak out

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:28.000
unless the family accept that they will do so.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:33.000
So, you know, so I am very, very young.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:42.000
I am very pleased that the work that I have done and the and what I have introduced the group to

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:59.000
to does not detract detract these people from their cultural beliefs and and practices.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:13.000
Speaking of voices and stories, can you tell us about some voices to project?

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:29.000
Today, I can with with I can with pride say to you that to celebrate our well,

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:40.000
well, it's more than 10 years, but to celebrate 10 years of what the skeptics said, it will never work.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:50.000
Today, we can we can lift our heads I and said, yes, we have surpassed those remarks.

00:59:50.000 --> 01:00:03.000
And those remarks are labeled that not as reminders, but for the next generation to add to to to take note of

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:19.000
and to realize that we have overcome those milestones because this project have created the platform for people to set to give this story

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:27.000
in in silent voice. It didn't it didn't take me to do it.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:35.000
It take a lot of people, a lot of time, a lot of convincing to to make it happen.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:52.000
But it is it is it is about to be explored in on the scene for everyone to to see and to read and to enjoy.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:04.000
And silent voice will help the younger generation to understand a little bit more about togetherness.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:17.000
And and then you have the full story of the building of Age Alive in It Will Never Work.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:32.000
That is a comprehensive story. Newport and and Newport, how it manages to not surrender,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:54.000
but to incorporate needs, requests and the right for their voices to be heard in the society that they're trying to develop.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:05.000
We are also thankful to their help in making this this this project a reality.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And we are grateful for every help that is being given by many people who thought this will never happen.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:35.000
We are thankful.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Personally, personally, my for me, I have given it I have given I have given it my best.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:08.000
And like I said, my greatest regret and when I say regret is not regret in saying that I've done something wrong and I need forgiveness.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:22.000
My greatest regret is that I did not have someone to point out to me a if you continue to to be obsessive and to give everything you've got to this or to that.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Your children are going to be upset in the years to come.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:51.000
I did not have that person because I could see doing something that makes someone else that bring happiness to someone else or to be or give justice to someone else or to or to make someone else's life.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:04:04.000
That less stressful or to help someone to find their way through.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
It makes me happy.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:13.000
But little did I know that it wasn't what makes my children happy.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Because in me, I feel that what I know what I do, it was for me and it would be for my children.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:33.000
And I I don't know, but I regretfully think that they could read my mind and to be understanding as I have been.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:49.000
But those are my final words and I hope that as the years go by, someone else will come along and make age alive.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:05:08.000
And I hope that the next year will be the cornerstone that brings more people together so that people recognize the ones who did the work.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:31.000
People like Brian, Brian Lenbeck, people like Griffiths, people like even David Phillips, people like Vanessa Cyrille.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:43.000
You know, those people are grassroot people who have done so much for our community.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:06:01.000
And we and hopefully age alive, what age alive have done will help the younger people to make up their mind and to be understanding and to to help their generation to grow.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Thank you.
