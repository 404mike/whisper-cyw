00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.540
Well, the images of the miners marching and some of the women, the wives marching.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:23.260
And I can recall Arthur Scargill obviously being there and encouraging the miners.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:30.220
I understood that because I remember going to Carmarthen Town with my husband and there

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.060
was a person stood on the corner asking for donations.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.020
And I went into my purse straight away and gave money.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.340
I think it was five pound at the time which is quite a bit but I really felt strongly

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.740
about the miners' strike.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.900
And the women having to get donations of food and making parcels up and taking them to

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.020
a certain centre and handing them out to families.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:13.340
I also remember the convoy of lorries that Maggie Thatcher set up.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:22.100
She was behind all this of hauliers, getting these hauliers to drive these lorries, paying

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.820
them very good money.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.700
The police were paid extra money because they had to be doing overtime I suppose.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.460
I remember all that and I can remember driving on the M4 because this is where I saw the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.860
convoys of lorries going back and forth, back and forth.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.620
I said to my husband, I don't know if I should say this, I'm going to put my fist up to

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.220
those lorry drivers.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.420
He said don't do that, they might jump out.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.980
But I'm laughing at it now because I get so worked up you see.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:11.820
I am very emotional and I get a strong feeling for the miners because I'm from a mining area

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.500
and lots of my relatives were miners.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:24.060
My uncle died in one of the falls in a pit called Wiley in Gwent you know and my father

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.260
and all his brothers went to the pit and they had to try and dig him out and he died there.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:40.180
So there's a lot of, I got a lot of feeling for the miners and if only the union of transport

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.260
or whatever came out to support them they might have won that strike but of course they didn't.
