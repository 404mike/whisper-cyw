00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I left school at 14, I went to a primary school, secondary modern school in Markham.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I left school at 15 years of age, I was 15 in September and I started in the mines in 1962,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and I started in the mines Christmas Eve of the same year.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I started underground, did my training, went to college, did some training,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and then I went to work on the face with some men. Within a year I broke my foot.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I was still only, I think perhaps just coming up to 16 or 16.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
How did you break your foot?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I was what they call withdrawing, getting timbers out,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
whole timbers out that had been supported in the roof and letting it go out.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I cut this one up with an axe and actually the stone fell and it rolled over and it went over main step,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
it went straight over my steel choke up and into my main step.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The funny thing about it was that they took me straight to my house in the ambulance,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
called my mother and said, do you want to see him before we take him out?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I was frightened to death. Yeah, they did that.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Then I came back, I worked on the face for a while and then I was asked to go to work with the splices.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So I went to work with the splices and I worked with the splices for about two years.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I was a striker, when they were cutting steel ropes I was the guy with the armour, the sledge.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:57.000
While doing that, a piece of steel went up through my eye and I was in hospital again and I was still only young.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
They took me, the eye was alright, they saved the eye, everything was okay.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The thing about that was that they took, as soon as I did it,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
they sent goggles down the mine for everybody who was using anything that afternoon, everything went alright.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So I did that and then that was okay.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I worked for a few years in the mines and decided that I'd go out to the mine site.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I was in roads working and repairing and on the coal.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Then I went outside to work and I worked for Wyn's Heavy Aldridge in Newport, massive company, big, carried heavy stuff.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I was a stiersman, finished there, went to work in a foundry and I thought, no I don't like this, I'm going back to the mines.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So I went back into the mines, went to Markham, Colleray and was a repairer and I worked on a coal.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Then the manager came to see me one day and said, I heard you were with the ventilation officers in Auckland when you were training.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I said, yeah, I'd like to train to be a ventilation officer here.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:14.000
So I did and I went and I passed the exams and everything and I think they were pretty good and I worked on doing that.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Then my marriage broke up after a couple of years and the manager stopped my lamp one day and said to me,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
listen Glen, there's a place in the Rhondda, in Dinas, in the mines rescuization, full time.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
If you're interested in going, I'll put your name forward.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:45.000
So I did and that's where I went to and I was there for about 10 years and then I had an accident with my leg, not underground or anything,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:56.000
but I hurt my foot and somebody came to see me and it wasn't fair to go down there, then a problem with walking.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
If I had to carry somebody, I would be a liability in case something went wrong.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
So I decided it was time to go out.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So then they came and they offered me redundancy and I took the redundancy and went outside.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Since then I've started up my own business and I'm still working today.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Did you enjoy working in the mines?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Loved it, absolutely loved it.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
It was hard work and it was dangerous work, but I like to come regularly.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I've been around everywhere and there is nowhere that I have seen a camaraderie like that.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I would imagine the only thing near that would be a soldier.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I wouldn't think anybody, I've never seen it anywhere else.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
It was kind of you were all in the same position.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000
We were all in the same position and if somebody, if he was working in the face and somebody had a piece of rough ground, it was bad,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
then you would finish your work and go and help him and the other blokes would come and help him and make it good.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
He was watching out for one another all the time.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
That was the thing. It was good.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
They looked out for you and that was good.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I really enjoyed that camaraderie.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Proper teamwork as well.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Yes, it was. It was always teamwork.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Were you taught teamwork? Was it just a natural thing?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
It was a natural thing, I think, that it just carried on.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:33.000
I went to work in the foundry and this is why I finished in the foundry, was that sometimes it was aluminium we were using

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and sometimes you put an ingot in and if there was water or it was cold, he would explore and go up in the air.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So everybody would run and whatever.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I went up one day and some of this molten aluminium spurted over and went down into his boots.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Nobody, but nobody, stopped working and just kept on and he was screaming on the floor.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
My brother was doing brass and I was doing aluminium. Only me and him ran two miners.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I put my notes in the afternoon and my brother and we both finished. I said, I don't know what you would be like that.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
There was no camaraderie at all and I was in Cavalier and I never forget that.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
I really finished me towards that. I finished that day.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
So there was no looking out for each other?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Not at all.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Were in the mines?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Yes, in the mines. If somebody got injured, they were on a stretcher and they were taken out.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
People were there and they were always reassuring them.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Was it always in the back of your mind that you could get injured any day or was it good knowing that you did get injured?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Every miner knows every day. He's always looking out for things you knew it was instinctive to know that there was danger there all of the time.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000
If it wasn't the roof, it could be a journey coming or it could be a walker moving.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
There were many, many different things underground that could catch you out.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:13.000
But I think miners were quite vulnerable. Although we did get caught out, we did get killed and were some people.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
There were some of these things.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So moving on to your first injury with your foot, you mentioned you will steal toe cap boots.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Yes.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Unfortunately, your accident missed the steel bits.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
It went into my toe cap and broke into my toe cap.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:46.000
How were you injured? Was it a permanent injury? Did your employer give you any kind of compensation or did they help you to get back into work?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I was just on the sick end.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Did you get paid on the sick end?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Yes, I got paid until my foot was okay and then I went back to work.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
You were able to go back down in the sick end.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:12.000
I was only young and I was very, very young. Today the kids are a lot older, I think, and advanced than we were.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I remember going down and I remember when it hurt so much. It was my first break.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:25.000
I had tears in my eyes and I remember the bloke I was working with, Tommy, Tommy Grasses.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
He looked at me and he said, is that a tear in your eye, boy?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
I'll never forget it. I said, no.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:40.000
He said to me, because you're a man now and men don't cry, you're a miner.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:49.000
I remember him telling me that and I didn't cry after. He'd do it a lot, but let me tell you, I wanted to.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Fifteen-year-old is a child, because you were a child at that time.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:05.000
That was the way it was. It was okay after. I had compensation. We used to get compensation.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000
They'd pay your wages and all of this. I didn't get any money for it because they broke my foot.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
So you had sick pay?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Sick pay and everything like that. They paid me. I went back to work and that was it. That was the way it was.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
How long were you off?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Oh, you know, approximately a month.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And they paid you full wage or was it a lesser wage?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
They paid me full wage.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
They paid me full my year.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:45.000
When you had the accident with your eye and you mentioned after that that everybody had goggles, how did it go from not having goggles to having goggles?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Was it simply your accident?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Well, the goggles must have been there. They must have been in the colliery because they were straight down the mine.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:06.000
They just didn't give me any goggles. I didn't know anything about it. They just closed my eyes and went straight through.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
So you think the goggles were probably available?

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Yeah, but they never...

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Did the other miners wear them?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
No, not many people were wearing my goggles at all.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Right, but after your accidents?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Yeah, they were totally having to wear them on.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Was it a case of if you don't wear them and you get injured then you won't get sick pay?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:46.000
I don't know. I don't know what they did but I know that I got... from my eye. I know they did it and then I had to go for a board with my eye.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:56.000
They gave me so much for life. I can't remember how much it was. They paid me up.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
So they gave you compensation?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
They gave me compensation for my eye, yeah. They did have compensation for my eye.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Were you paid sick pay as well?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:11.000
I was paid when I was off, yeah. But then they paid me a couple hundred pounds I think. It was like perhaps about £300.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Which was a lot of money.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:20.000
It was a lot of money then, but yeah, and I had that. And then I supposed to have had a pension for it.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And then the government came in and said, no, no, anybody under 3% or whatever is... you know, they stopped that pension. You've got to have 7%.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
It didn't matter, but that was the way it went.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:41.000
But you had compensation. Did you have lasting damage in your eye or did it leave you right?

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:52.000
No, no, no. It hasn't affected my eyesight at all. They were worried about cataracts, but I never even had a cataract.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:01.000
But it was the steel span and the corneas of the eye, the covering of the eye, and spread it, but it stayed there.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
So they had to turn it and pull it back out. Yeah, not nice.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:14.000
But yeah, they did that and they put two stitches in it. As you can see if you look, they put two stitches in my eye.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And then after a couple of weeks, they said to me, you're going to go on with your eye, you need stitches out.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
So I went down to the theatre and I drew the stitches out and that's the worst pain I've ever had in my life.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I passed out about three times. They just picked it off with a tweezers and pulled it, but it was pulling it off, you know.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Pulling it out through the eye. So that wasn't nice, but yeah, I passed it about three times. I don't remember that.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
But yeah, that was the way it was, you know.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
But you were a man.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
I was a man. No, I didn't cry.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
You'd listened to your father who advised you when you were 15 not to cry.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. He taught me how to cry.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Yeah, that's the way it was, you know.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:19.000
But I think when I was in the mines since coming out of the mines, I had tests for my hearing aid, for my ears and I like.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And they said, oh yeah, you've got a little bit of hearing loss.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And I went about 12 months ago and they said it's a little bit progressive and my wife said you better go because you're not listening to me.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And I went and I went and I got apparently a severe hearing loss.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
But I can hear you, you know, but it's too what it is, severe hearing loss in both ears.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And she said you had that for a long, long time.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Do you think it's to do with working in mines?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was boring, boring holes and I know boring Europeans, it was, yeah.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:05.000
So if it was eight or ten holes, you know, and six inch, six foot long, you know, boring that.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And he had, if anything, then with that and he said well you heard it straight after he had trouble with my hands.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And I went to have an operation, I had to go and see about my hands.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And I saw a doctor who said to me, do you usually work in a mines, do you?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And I said yeah.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
So you go away and get it?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
I said no.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
He said no.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
He said did they test you for it?

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
I said no, not really, they just let me in.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
He said well you've got a carpal tunnel in both hands, he said and that's from vibrating.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
So I did a conversation for that, you know, as well, with my hands.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
From the coal board?

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
From the government.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
So right finger is another name for?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
No, no, no, white finger and carpal tunnel are a different thing.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Oh right, so what's a white finger?

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
White finger, your fingers go numb, you know, they will go white everywhere.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And it's something in your hand for a while.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And then it goes white, that's what you think, like white finger.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
So it gets very painful, it's not nice.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:11.000
But what I had is your veins, they twist around your veins, sitting with whatever.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
So they had to operate on both my hands to get them right.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:22.000
They're not right now, but you know, I get penchant for it, so yeah, that's okay.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
You know, I can put up with that.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
That's the thing, you know.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:36.000
So apart from your mishaps, were you aware of any other accidents or anybody with any kind of disability working in the mine?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Was there anybody who had lost a limb or?

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Yeah, I remember my own dad died at 48 with emphysemia and they said it was nothing to do with the cold, but it was, it worked out, it is.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Something to do with it.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000
But when I went to put up a conversation with my mother, it was too long ago, he didn't live long enough, he only died at 48.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
So where did that go?

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000
I don't know whether, you know, she should have got the compensation, not him, but they never paid her anything.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
I thought that was really, really bad and I've heard a lot of stories like that since.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Yeah, I remember a bloke called Ronnie Bishop.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
I think he caught his foot in the Panzer chain.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:33.000
He was like, he worked with a limp or one, he still worked underground, he couldn't work on a face or anything anymore.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
But he still worked there, he worked on a corrie.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
There were lots of hellas and bad accidents, you know.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And was allowances made?

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Oh, they were, yeah, they were definitely allowances made for people, you know.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:17:04.000
And even too, I won't mention names, but when I worked in A Corrie, there was a man there, I would say he had autism.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
I would think autism.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Norah, a lovely bloke, really good.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:19.000
But he really could make radios.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
He'd make a radio app from scratch, a really good guy.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000
I'll never forget it, but he was so, if you talked to him, he was not with it, you know.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
But the manager gave him a job cleaning the toilet.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
So I always remember, he went for a job and the manager said, yes, you can have a job.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
He couldn't put him underground, no way, he'd be too dangerous, couldn't, you know.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:56.000
But yeah, I always remember him and he had this going and one day I was with the manager walking down because we were going together to see something.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
He said to me, what's that noise, Glen?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
I said, what noise?

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
That noise, he said.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
And I said, oh, it's the radio, it was music playing, you know.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Where's he coming from?

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
I said, toilets.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
So he walked over to the toilets.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
And I always remember him and he said, this fella was in there.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
And he said to him, why have you got that on?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Why is that on in you now?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
He said, I'm going to do my engineering work.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.000
And he said to him, I refer to him as Mr. Man, I don't want to get this guy in.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:40.000
He said, it's on, he said, because you told me that I had a very important job.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:49.000
And you told me that I was to lag the pipes if there was any icing and things to make sure there wasn't any bursts.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
And he said, yes.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
I said, I'm listening if there's going to be any snow.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
So the manager said, OK, he said.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
He walked up to Tony and he said, it's time for me to finish now, Glen.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
He said, isn't it June?

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
It was the middle of June, he was boiling up.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
He just passed on his pipe, he walked away and he just said, oh, leave him go.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
It was funny, but you know, that's what they were like, you know.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
They weren't all bad.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Managers weren't all bad.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
I found some of them really good, you know.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Some of them were hard.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
But yeah, good ones, you know.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Was there many people with learning disabilities?

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000
I didn't see a lot, but I remember him really well.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Not everybody, people.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Not that he was diagnosed.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Not that he was diagnosed.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Yeah, not that he was diagnosed.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Let's say then, some people weren't suitable to go underground.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Or to work on the surface in certain areas.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Where you have machinery and other safety if you want to.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
But they did work in other areas, you know.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
I mean, they could help on the timber yard.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
You know, with supervision they could work different places, you know.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Yeah, there were other people in the mines with disabilities, you know.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Do you know if they were paid the same or were they paid for the job?

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Well, they were paid the surface rate.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Whatever the surface rate was going, they were paid exactly the same.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
You know, it doesn't matter whatever.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
I mean, they were paid the same.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
There weren't any discrepancies to my knowledge anyway.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Yeah, there were some really good people about them.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Some people who understood that there were difficulties with some people.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
And it was good to see.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000
And I noticed that miners were very tolerant of this.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
And always nice to these people.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
I treated them not as less, but as equals.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
And always laughing.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
How are you going?

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
So, you know, it was good.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
That was good.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
I like that.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000
The more I talk to people, the more positive things are.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Even though it's a really hard job.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
But the camaraderie, that word, is mentioned every single time you interview somebody, isn't it?

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
The camaraderie and the teamwork.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000
It does sound like such a good place to work apart from the danger and the lies and everything.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
It does seem very difficult.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
It was hard and it was horrible in places.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
And he's the same.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000
I've heard people saying, you know, you're miners, you're money for a rope and all this nonsense.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
But when you take him to the camaraderie, like I had an uncle who said,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
you're getting too much money, you people are always on strike.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
And all this.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
He said to him, well, come with me then.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
I took him to the pithead and I raged to the manager to take him down.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
He looked over the top like, I'll be studying going on ahead.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
And I said, come on, we haven't started yet.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
That's only going down.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
But no, he wouldn't go down.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
He changed his mind a bit quick.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
But it isn't, you know.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
It's not about that.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
It's about...

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
But everything, you know, that was good.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
There was positives, you know.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
There were positives.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
And the positives were good.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Yeah, we didn't get a lot of money in the beginning.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
But I remember, I think it was £22.50 they paid us.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
£12.80. £18 was in the second.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
That was a top of £18 second.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.000
When I started, I think I was on...

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
£6 a week.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
What's that?

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
You went morning, you started down below.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
I went morning, you went...

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
I went £6 a week, I think I started on about £6 a week.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
But yeah, you know, I mean, the Tardic kids, they only go one.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
One half of the money, don't they?

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
And the times have changed and things have changed, the values have changed.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Yeah, it was, you know.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000
It was hard.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
I really enjoyed my time in the rescue service.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Because, you know, the camaraderie there was really, you know, it was a god.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Really good.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
We saw some things, done some things.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Saw some things.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Worked together regularly.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Had a laugh and I know, you know, I can always remember.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
One of the funniest things of all that.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Nobody liked going into the old drift mines.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
You know, it was shut because they were full of cold water, you know.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
And everything, and when they went in, they were dating in bits and pieces, falling.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
And you ought to be careful, you know.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
And we had a call one night, and I'll never forget it.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
So anyway, we ran up the station and got up the station.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
And the boss said I was a volunteer, as he said, to go into an old drift mine.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
So everybody started to sort their off, you know.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Walk away like he said.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Come on now, boys.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.000
And it was a 26-year-old woman, I think she was 26, that stripped off naked, took her two kids.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
And stripped off naked and went into this drift.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Walked into this drift mine.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
But you couldn't get on the band, right?

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Nobody could get on the band.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Who was Jock?

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
They were up there, but gee, apparently the kids had run away.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
And she had backtracked.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.000
I don't know how right this is, but I know the army, everybody was looking, but nobody could find her anyway.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
But I think she had backtracked and gone in a vehicle and disappeared.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
With somebody.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
End of story.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
I have heard she's been seen since.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:14.000
But I think if they ever caught you, she'd be doing a jail term because it cost thousands and thousands of pounds to turn out a team and get everybody looking for her.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
And I know how her boys dived in there, you know.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
So they risked their lives.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Well, they would have, yeah, because when you go into somewhere like that, I mean, apparently when they went in and walked around the corner, there was a ledge.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Now she wouldn't have been able to see that in the dark.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
I suppose she would have walked into that.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
But it was so cold, she would have gone unconsciously.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:44.000
But they went, we had some officers there who used to do the skid diving, you know.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:51.000
And they went in and they never found anything, you know, when she went in there.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
But yeah, you know, how dangerous just to...

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
So what happened to the children?

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
They went to sleep with their grandad and their grandma, I think.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
And I don't know what happened.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
I did hear she had a boyfriend up north or something, and this is what had happened.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
She'd gone in, to make like if she'd gone in and died.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Oh, right.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
But she'd backtracked and gone in a circle.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000
That's what I heard.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
I don't know whether it happened.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
I don't know.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
That's what we were told.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
But yeah, but they were good men to work with.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Some of them I worked with were in Six Bells explosion, you know.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Some of them were in Aberfan.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
They were all from different things, you know.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:43.000
What was the worst kind of rescue mission, the deadliest rescue mission you went on?

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
I never went on many deadly ones.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
But I went on more or less in Bryn Llyw.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
We went there one morning and there was a fire.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
And on the way, they said it was...

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
We'd listened to the radio, you know, and it was like port control, port number one.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.000
And they were telling him that this fire now is timber and coal, you know, spontaneous combustion, right?

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Then he went from coal and then he went into belt.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000
And he went from that to being coal, to belt and oil burning.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
You know, and we thinking, oh, here we go.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:32.000
But when we got there, there was two inspectors there, Gifford, I think, and he was, I'm not sure, Gifford.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
And I remember the one.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
One was a coal board and one was the union guy.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
And we went into it and Lachy were the one side fight, you know.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
And we were the other side with the smoke coming towards us.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
So we were in there and we were closing down, you know.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
And he said, can you see a door?

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
And we said, yeah.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
He said, what's the cover like?

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
And there was nothing there at all, no timber.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000
It all burned away.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.000
There was no timber down, so we had to put steel over the top, which is a no-no, you know, because steel slips, not steel, do it.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:13.000
But anyway, we put it there and I was with a fellow, a school field, and he collapsed, me and him, it was all right.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:19.000
But then we got in and we eventually got past this place, into where this door was, you know.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
And he said, what is it like?

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
And we said, well, it's red hot, like.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
He said, well, cool it down, you know.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
So we cooled it down and he said, well, go in there.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
He said, it's a powder magazine, which was, you know.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:42.000
And we went in and he said, right, can you get, so he said, we're the captain, can you undo something and tell us what it's like?

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
So I don't know what happened, but I know some of it was sweating and whatever, and we didn't know.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
It was daily jacks, daily, but all different types of stuff, wasn't it?

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:58.000
And he said, so tell us then, what's it like, Leo, did this go in?

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
He said, I don't know.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000
He said, I've never, ever, never, ever had it in this state before.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
He said, he could have gone puff, he said, or he could have left the top of the mountain, you know, but I'm asking him to bring it out, like.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
But we did bring it out, you know, sorry.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
But I think the best one I ever went on was up the partag.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000
And we was up there and we went in.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
And these two guys, they tried a machine from the top.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
They were in a private mine.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000
And we worked out the length they were in.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
And there was no air going in there, but we could talk to them because there was a phone line in there.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
And there was two blocks trapped.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:53.000
And when we got there, I always remember the mother, the wives and mothers were there, and the kids, and the kids were saying, go give it a go, you know, really, really upsetting.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
They never were allowed to come too near, I suppose.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000
And everybody assumed they saw the vehicle, all the rescue boys, they'd be all over, you know, in two seconds.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
They were going to wave a magic wand and everything, but it's not that easy, you know.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
And there wasn't much hope to getting them out.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
But on digging in, you know, the teams, the different successive teams had worked.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
And apparently their own men had dug a lot, you know.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
And there was no way, you know, they'd distance in.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
But apparently we hit the journey in the road.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
And we went at the site of the journey and got them out.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
They were digging out, we got them out.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
So we did get them out.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
Well, that was a nice one, you know, that was a lovely one, you know.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
But yeah, it was nasty.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
The first one I went on was my own Caldry marker.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
There was a fire in the shaft and I had to go down on top of the cage with another rescue man.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
And they said, you can't put any harnesses on it because you've got to wear your armor.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
So we had to stand on the top and he just slung a chain around and we went down.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
I had to walk across this narrow, narrow thing, frightening to death.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
But there was, yeah, there was other things.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
But yeah, that was the way it was, you know.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000
It was good and I enjoyed it.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
I enjoyed my time there.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
I liked the boys I worked with, you know, the officers were good.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
We had good fun together.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
It was a good community because we all lived.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
We had our own tennis courts.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
There was a training pool lesson.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
We had our own swimming pool.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:26.000
We had our own rack, rack nation room where there was no cup of tea, table.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
And we had table tennis, I think, and all different things like that, you know.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000
We used to do all these things.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
They had tennis courts and we used to do all of that.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
But when we lived there, you know, bumping out, we did everything ourselves, you know, and everything, you know.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:46.000
But we would challenge the local rugby team or the local cricket team, you know, to play our women.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
I remember that.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
And then they came down.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
We played them in rugby.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Well, I mean, I think all our boys were 35, 40 and they were about 20, you know.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
We had three steps, but it was good, you know.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
But we said to them, you ought to come and play our women and cricket, you know.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
So they said, yeah, right, oh, we'll play them.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
And I said, oh, we got a cracking cricket team.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
So they came down, I was fully expecting them to see all these women coming down, you know.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
It was all the boys dressed up when there was women, like, you know.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:22.000
But the funniest thing is, this one Alan, he was going away the next day to Benidorm or somewhere like that.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Poor old boys dead, you know.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000
But I remember him and we played and he had a strap thing on.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.000
And of course, when we changed, he had straps and bras that could be used, you know.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
He said, I'm going to go away, you know.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Oh, the sun.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
He had a sun tan of a bra.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Like, he had a bra and everything.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
So everybody laughed at him.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
But that was what he was.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
But good, good, good.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
And good camaraderie.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:58.000
You know, when, if something was on, one of the boys would go and knock on the women and tell them what was going on.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Everything's OK.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
You never say, oh, no, it's a big fire.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
You know, it was just without a safety day.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Ah, the boys were all right, they're great, you know.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
But I can remember going on one early in the morning.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:16.000
And when I came back at six o'clock until Sunday morning, I think I came back at six o'clock in the evening.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
We'd gone about four or five in the morning.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
I came back about six.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
And my wife and children were there, you know.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000
And they had that dinner and they wouldn't eat until I came home.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
And it was, you know, it must have been horrific for them, you know.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:40.000
But, yeah, I mean, you know, when you think of it, it had happened by the time we got there mostly.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000
I know sometimes it could be a bit scary, but it had happened and was all over by the time we got there.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
If it was an explosion, it had happened by the time we got there.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
We had to go and pick the bits, you know, so the things happened.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
It always picked bits happened, you know.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000
But mostly, yes, we'd gone to a fire or something like that.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
But, yeah, that's the way it was, you know.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
It was a good money being on the rescue team.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000
It was good money.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
It was good money.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:14.000
But, you see, having said that, you'd be on crew from eight o'clock in the morning.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
Until, say, half past four.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
And then you'd be on crew from the time you finished.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Till morning you'd be on call.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
And you'd be doing that four days a week or five days a week sometimes, you know.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
One of the chefs was 24 hours.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
The fireman was 24 hours.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
You'd be on in the morning, you know, you'd go home.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Somebody'd come and relieve you for an hour and you'd be back on.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
You know, you'd do it.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
So that's the way it was.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
But, you know, it was a lot of waiting time, a lot of time in the house.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
You couldn't go out because if something happened, you had to move.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
And they did pride themselves on quick going out there, you know.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000
Really, I think it was about just over a minute from bed.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000
You know, and our vehicle was leaving the yard.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
So you had to be quick, you know.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Yeah, it was good.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
I enjoyed it.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Felly, ond unrhyw beth oedd ychwanegol eich bod yn ei ddweud amdano?

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000
