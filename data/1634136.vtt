00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800
I was diving with the Sea Search Volunteer Survey Group back in 1999, looking at the

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.600
seabed to the east of the St. Tudwell's Islands off Abersach in Traumatic Bay when we found

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.320
mantis shrimps for the first time.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.600
I've always been interested in sediment burrowing fauna, having looked at mud communities in

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.680
Scottish sea lochs, where you regularly find various species of mud burrowing crustaceans,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.440
fish and even giant fireworks and enemies that produce characteristic burrows and tubes.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.400
But I didn't recognise the thumb diameter vertical holes we started to find in the muddy

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.200
gravel on that sea search dive.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.360
I couldn't see anything down the burrow, so I poked a finger down and didn't find anything.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.900
Pushing harder into the sediment I could feel that the burrow went vertically down for about

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.640
20cm and then levelled off.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.400
I could also see that I was pushing water through the far end of the burrow by the small

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.240
plume of silt coming out of an exit about 40cm away.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.920
It was then my ungloved fingers were stabbed by something sharp and shortly after a prawn-like

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.760
animal shot out through the silt plume and started running off across the seabed.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.360
I grabbed it, got stabbed a few more times and somehow managed to get it into my sample

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.720
bag that I had stowed in my drysuit pocket.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.420
I could now see that what I had in the bag was clearly a mantis shrimp.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.880
It had the characteristic long serrated forelimbs designed to snatch prey animals, very like

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.080
those of a praying mantis.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.520
It had two twin lobed compound eyes and a heavily armoured tail.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.800
But what was it doing in this part of Wales?

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.760
Back on dry land, the old Hamlin guide described Squilla desmoresti as the best fit for this

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.440
species, but the distribution seemed to be limited to the Mediterranean and only as far

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.200
north as the English Channel.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.560
Further investigation confirmed that its current scientific name was Rhysoides desmoresti,

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.580
and this new record extended its known range much further north and it was also a new record

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.120
for Wales.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.800
This news went well beyond the scientific community and the mantis shrimps were even

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.020
featured on the national news and mainstream TV.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.340
Since that dive I have been back regularly to get a better idea of its abundance and

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.880
distribution.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.920
Once you get your eye in, the burrows are easy to discriminate from the burrows of other

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.600
species in the area and you can tell whether they are occupied or not by the intact lining

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.220
of fine silt at the entrance.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.560
We found them around much of Cardingham Bay, around the 10-15m depth zone where the suitable

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.980
mixture of stable muddy gravel and sand that supports the formation of the burrows.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.700
At their most abundant there is as many as one burrow every 5-10m2, so that's a lot

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.120
of mantis shrimps overall in this area.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.880
But until recently I have never seen them occurring naturally out of their burrows.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.140
In 2020 I was lucky enough to be involved in the filming of a natural history programme

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.200
about the marine life of Wales, and that included diving at night on the mantis shrimp beds.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.440
In the middle of a warm summer's night we waited on the seabed next to a group of burrows

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.560
and watched and filmed them as they emerged.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.360
They are nocturnal.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.960
We saw a couple of animals travelling across the seabed and also tracked one as it disappeared

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.360
down a burrow.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.560
But we still don't know whether they leave from and return to the same burrow, or whether

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.560
they might even use multiple burrows.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.560
A good excuse to dive this area again at night.
