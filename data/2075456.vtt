WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.240
yourself okay and tell their names. Okay good afternoon I'm Mrs Christina Roy. Today we are

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:21.760
going to organize an oral history interview with Mr and Mrs Majumdar for the Wales Puja Committee

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:35.560
for taking the past memories and the history of heritage of Dugga Puja in Wales. Good afternoon

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:46.440
Mrs Majumdar. How and when did you get involved in the festival for Wales Puja Committee? Okay I

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:53.240
think to be honest you know to remember because it's such a long time ago but as far as I remember

00:00:53.240 --> 00:01:00.280
I got a phone call one day I think from in Cardiff you know there were two gentlemen Mr Goddok and

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:08.240
I think Mr Shambu Dars all of a sudden they saying that the Bodhi I need you we need your help I said

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.880
what why what sort of help my husband was busy at that time you know he's a single-handedly

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:21.080
practitioner he was so unfortunately he was in you know not home so I had to answer the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.000
phone and everything so he said could you please we're going to start the Puja in

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.280
Cardiff but we need some stuff for the Puja have you got this Kosha Kushi Chandan card all the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.080
Puja thing you know utensils for Puja, Allah shak all these things so I mentioned whatever I

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:46.800
got and this decided the day I mentioned that all that was fixed in any way at that time there

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.080
was no committee no meeting nobody only few family the initial started Mr Goddok and Mr Shambu Dars

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.560
but they invited few family I think you will know already you know perhaps Mr. Miseskaw,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:11.000
Mr. Mishro, Dr. Animesh Dars, Mr. Palit, ourself and Dr. Barsak all this family the only the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:21.440
whole estate and if I were Mr. Mishro I told you so a few family they invited and I think Dr.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.280
Mrs. Haldar whether they were there as well isn't it Amadar so they were involved in the beginning so

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.400
few families came and they said that whoever the Bengali or Indian you know you tell them we are

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.480
doing the Puja so instead of family oriented Puja only few families started so we didn't know anybody

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.480
how is what's going to be like that and all so whatever I thought I saw the Puja in our house

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.440
in India my mother or grandmother whatever they used to do a Lohi Puja or any other Puja Sharswati

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.880
Puja we had in our house Durga Puja also in our Desh so I remember all the things you know Puja

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:09.440
fruits cuttings and what sort of things we need five fruits and sweets and things like that so

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:17.520
that was arranged few people took Shardar but most of all arranging and telling everybody what to do

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.960
not to do those two gentlemen was doing and we are sort of working whatever but it was nice good

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.840
experience and we're excited that we're going to have the Puja there and we had the Prithima the

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.960
first one someone came I can't remember the name the gentleman you might know after what Mr.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:43.840
Parth she had a picture a painted picture the first one I think you might have in our old

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:54.160
pictures that the first Prithima was painted they brought it in parade and we started the Puja there

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:05.520
first memory what she has done she has jumped few stages yeah but there are other things happen

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:12.600
yeah whatever is in the school and other things then you can't get parade like that you have to

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:26.120
we did series of places then came the back it's good art come again okay the same so what were

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:33.000
the major challenges you faced while arranging or organizing the Puja around those times I

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.640
think the the beginning it was the main factor that when we started finding that you know we

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.400
spent quite a lot of time in the morning and in the evening time the first thing obviously everybody

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.480
gets hungry so food was the main thing factor we get the Prasad fall and fruits and everything

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.400
but gradually we started you know thinking in the evening time a lot of people started coming I

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:04.560
mean outside Kadi the Bristol Newport so the audience was coming up so then everybody thought

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.880
the collection was also coming up so we thought we better give the order the food and with the

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.800
few family member that we were paying more contribution at that time for the meeting the

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.960
cost so the food was coming and then gradually when the member came quite a lot and we decided

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.760
to you know make up you know the formative committee was formed is the main factor was

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:35.040
beginning you know the food that started with that then you need money so there how to get

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:49.760
about that so everybody had a decision ask him community was not formed so easily there are always

00:05:49.760 --> 00:06:02.360
a controversy that and one person I don't want to name he doesn't like the committee so

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:13.040
he said no we are doing puja and we are collecting money everything they let the people come and

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:21.000
enjoy it and whatever confidence and this is only we will control not the committee

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:37.680
so whether there is issues of money then the some or other that gentleman is gone out and then came

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:47.080
to other people they said yes there is a committee to be formed and especially Dr.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:54.440
Banerjee was came without how can you and how you can handle public money and the public has

00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:01.240
every right to know how you spend that money so you will have to give a chart after the puja

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:08.800
and let them see what you have spent so everybody thought it was a very rational and reasonable

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:22.800
judgment so some or other the conquevers and that's it so what collecting the money what would

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.720
you think like the money came through like did all the members put in the money or was there a

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:39.880
policy to get money in our fund whatever we got the fund at the end you will see there was always

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:50.440
a deficit so we managed the deficit ourselves so at the end they decided that you you better go

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:59.480
everybody's house and collect the money initially you can see that who are the people who has much

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:08.760
interest in the puja and come with a much more reverence and what you call Bhakti they are the

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:18.680
people they are with us so we go first and then you go other people so we started so we form a

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:29.560
group three or four four or five and in the car they will go and the response was that nearly 50

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:39.880
50 I don't want to say anymore because few checks are bounced so so we don't want anymore

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:48.680
and somebody may say by check I can't see it finally any check book so these are the experience

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:57.800
we had somebody said well next hour another puja is our puja that is number of three their food is

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:06.800
better than yours so no so these are the experience we had and we have to say when you get your check

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:15.560
book we'll come again so this is our experience but there are people who lavishly give the money

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:24.440
without any question so there is a two contrast between the two anyway this was the collection

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:33.200
started but at the end when our fund has grown up gradually and people are coming and coming only

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:44.560
20 people started now there is 50 60 70 80 people then he said we stop collection let them come and

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:53.280
whoever like to give money collection of the whole yeah so that's and we should appoint

00:09:53.280 --> 00:10:02.560
chairman vice chairman account accountant there is a controversy whether you should

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:10.200
appointed accountant some says there is no need the treasurer will do the job both and you must

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:21.400
show that that there is account to be shown to the public and let the public have the say in the

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:33.040
annual general meeting then the conception of the registration of the

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:53.560
friends one or two friends they started with solicitor and with a discussion with him but

00:10:53.560 --> 00:11:02.560
ultimately it was rejected in the car the registration of the sink in Liverpool they said that it doesn't

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:11.800
comply with the regulations and others so it can't be registered then at the time one member of that

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:23.360
committee died and that is lost work to me was that I can't do it and I'm going now in

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:33.840
within that hospital so you take this charge and do the registration as you can so I said well when

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:44.200
you fail how can I how can I do it how can I do these things all right then I I took it and he

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:56.680
died next day then I thought very much then I went to the country so much they registered then

00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:04.440
the other those who were registered I took a note from them these are the way to proceed and then

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:17.000
same solicitor then I invited Dr Sharma and we had a meeting in our house here number of times

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:30.960
and again with the row mr. Rowan row solicitor's name Roger Walter he said oh well it can't be

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:39.320
done I said yes it can be done this is the way to go through so he had a thought about it and he then

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:46.680
he corrected all the forms and applications and everything then there is a covenant that you got

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:55.440
to pay contribution to any earthquake already anything you got to show that you have given them

00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:03.600
and you want to show cultural things something cultural going on and you must keep accounting

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:13.440
or accounts and then it will be passed then ultimately passed. Ask a question. I think the

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:19.480
constitution here I think we told already about constitution all the things here okay I know the

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:25.800
committee was formed after a while but did you have to form a new constitution to run the

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:36.960
When the this question of charity when arose and deeply we thought about it the first important

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:45.680
part of the charity in the registered office in Liverpool they will ask the constitution so we

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:58.080
got to run up constitution and as Sandeep has said the meeting was first arranged in our house

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:10.280
and we started drawn up all the process and back to this solicitor and then we sent to Liverpool

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:19.160
for their consideration. Okay we are starting now. How do you think Durga Puja and festival

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:29.720
has evolved over the period? As you know the lot of people come from UK and other parts of the country

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:38.800
like Middle East and others they didn't have much place to go there and offer their offerings to

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:46.560
God and this is the place they find apart from London Liverpool Glasgow they're too far from

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:57.000
them so they came with their own mind that after all God will bless me if I attain and if I get

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:09.280
some holy water then it will be prosperous in my life but that is the fall and everybody some

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:15.600
friends have gone there and attended the puja they liked it very much they attended Pushpanjali they

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:24.360
attend prasad and meet so many people introduce themselves and they go back and to their place

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:32.520
and talk to other friends but have you seen all this yes we will also go with you this is the way

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:42.360
it evolved. So what do you think brought the group together and were like able to hold together now

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:51.520
like how it's been able to sustain till now? Because the group has developed a confidence and

00:15:52.480 --> 00:16:03.040
strength in their mind that after all the God is there and God will bring us together this is the

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:10.560
main theme not that the so many people coming introducing ourselves and making friends and

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:20.160
go up is not that it is not seeing the prithima and the image of the prithima and all the

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:32.000
paraphernalia of the offering and anjuli and then home then the fire after the puja and putting

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:42.520
fire on the head these all the things evolved and joined together harmoniously rather than anything

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:50.160
else no criticize to each other no nothing no this is the main thing and after that whatever you

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:57.080
think. Would you like to comment anything about the overall feeling about the festival?

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:07.200
My feeling is this the puja will prosper you cannot stop I cannot stop it is God who will

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:16.160
move the wheel over the head and doing everything in their own way so that the people come and give their

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:29.080
offerings and to them and she or he will bless us that is she is there on the heaven and the

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:38.880
come for one day in a ostomy and they look each other what we are doing that is the

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:48.280
conception people come and offering their medications and everything and puja and

00:17:48.280 --> 00:18:00.160
anjuli and that is the way people are coming and coming and also you can see the other part of

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:09.520
this cultural side lot of people like songs lot of people like dance lot of people like chandalika

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:17.440
and all these things they never seen this ago in UK I can see what a great pleasure that is the

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:23.560
Ravindra sumi and not only that the puja brings all the big artists from different parts of

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:32.120
Calcutta or any other parts and they hear their songs they enjoy themselves and that is the cultural

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:45.360
part side of it and not least good food food to morning and lunchtime and night that is a great

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:54.240
enjoyment and all are ready-made and hot they say oh lovely food we are getting that is also

00:18:54.240 --> 00:19:00.320
attraction that's it are there any other things which you would like to share yeah that you

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:08.480
want to come back again on it here so would you like to comment anything else on all your overall

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:16.440
feelings about the festival within Kharif yeah I think as I said it before you know the you

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:21.520
heard the first part of that how we struggle but gradually when we had a lot of member came in

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:29.920
youngster got interested then the committee was formed everybody got there took their

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:36.120
responsibility doing the frame but then one person had to do a lot of thing so the variety

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:43.360
program was nice the we have a catering officer who talked about good things and doing that

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:49.640
obviously it's a group activity not individual so everybody worked very hard I wouldn't say

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:59.240
on that gradually gradually it's sort of homo shape and main thing we kept it one thing that

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:05.560
will do the puja as we have done the religious part should be kept it wasn't the change you

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:12.040
know that religious part was done the same but we added doing the cultural program and encouraging

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:19.000
the children to take the part they are also took the responsibility and the decorations and all

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:26.200
a different activity which they more interested you know then to take part otherwise they would

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:32.280
have been bored so those are thing you know gradually gradually we sort of people thought

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:40.480
how to improve the committee's activity to part in it so the youngster came up so the older people

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:46.080
also little bit took little bit backside but they were there to give the advice through the

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:52.560
double collection in the hall came up money came up now now we can it's nice to see that

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:59.960
committee going stronger people are more interested outside of Cardiff I think in Cardiff people

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.400
outside of Cardiff when we see the picture in computer people phone from London we saw you in

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:13.080
the puja that's nice to know it's coming up and all this so that at that time we think that few

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:19.600
family worked very hard beginning that's why we kept the puja going and it's now rewarding to see

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:26.520
the younger generation is following keeping our tradition and I hope at least you know they won't

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:32.560
forget about the puja part as much as they can I know you have to time to time with the time you

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:38.800
might have to change something perhaps the time exact time we can't do but as long as we can keep

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:44.760
some of the parties right then I think people won't lose the interest you know that's the main

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:51.040
part of the younger generation now to keep it together not to have a division anymore what I

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:58.000
find myself that I always used to tell that to be a good committee member that you always must

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:05.640
think that we must agree to be thought to you know to have a disagreement if we agree on that

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:11.560
point everybody will have to be agreeing in all point you know but we have a right to disagree

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:18.640
some of the point and contribute our you know comment on that keeping in mind that we are all

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:24.120
doing voluntary job it's not a big job so we shouldn't bring any conflict in ourselves

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:29.440
whenever we are there in the puja committee meeting or doing about the puja everybody giving

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:35.040
their time free everybody thinking about the puja nobody is paid it's not a paid worker so

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:40.640
nobody blamed to every one of the people if somebody fight is wrong very politely they said

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:47.600
that if I were you I would do like that not commenting criticizing and backbiting I think

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:53.720
that is now got to think that if we want to keep up going on next 20 years to what we have done

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:59.480
before we should learn from our mistake I know we haven't done all correct things we have learned

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:05.560
from our mistake every year to year how to improve the thing how to you know get the sweet how to

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:12.160
cut the cost-cutting thing when we started cooking our food on premises we started saving money

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:17.800
previously we used to pay the money for the caterer but a lot of money then remember thought

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:24.200
how to collect the money so this sort of thing came up and now the people are thinking they're

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:29.880
thinking how to improve the youngster doing the same thing now the computer age has come is much

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:36.400
easier previously we used to pay a lot of phone charges phone call we invited people to our own

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:41.800
phone call so we also paid a lot of money from our own but we didn't think about that we thought

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:49.040
we're doing something you know that for our own enjoyment and that is I think kept us going on

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:56.880
which we I think there were some good day bad days but well at the end you know to see mother

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:02.120
got still in Cardiff and now new images being formed new image coming up to the put him up being

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:08.320
built and the card for the children's you know this country's children also know you were all

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:14.360
working very hard for the school project it's nice to see and I'm sorry we are getting older

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:20.760
obvious that we can't help physically be there but I think we have done our share and I think we

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:25.640
should leave it to the younger people and I always salute and I always respect what is there doing

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:33.040
because I we can't do now much so we shouldn't resize but at least we can say time to time

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:41.200
whatever we feel better sort of notice advice I'd say that if you feel it will be nice or if I see

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:47.320
something going wrong I can politely say that that liberty should be that should be given to the

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:53.720
older generation I mean younger people think that all the world they are gone the we won't take

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:58.600
their advice that shouldn't be that would be for the younger generation part that that the older

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:04.200
generation are there if they need some any advice they have to give it they because their

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:10.600
experience is important whoever maybe who have worked very hard I know this is how the

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:18.240
Mrs. Chaudhary is not the number five and number 11 I wanted to say that Mrs. Chaudhary they are

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:24.040
the people who are there in the beginning they also very hard with us so I'm sure they will be

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:32.280
so all the members were not there that doctor I said either not there this is a Mrs. Acharya

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:37.400
I said you will be managing the energy body all the members were really in the beginning they

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:44.220
quite hard who just write and advise and working and Dr. Shambhu Pata passed away who else now

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:52.040
our friend I think we'll mention after and Shambhu Pata I said Dr. Shambhu Pata that one he was our

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:58.480
member so he worked and he passed away so all the members who were there Dr. Ganguly was the

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:04.720
beginning and the member not long he stayed actively but he was also the founder member one

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:11.120
of the Mr. Siendars they were all not actively but in the beginning they all passed away so

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:16.880
with you know you always remember them and whoever did it little bit of contribution I think we

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:23.800
should remember I think we all are human being obviously we'll have a different opinion everything

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:30.680
but at least we will try and that is my prayer to everybody pray to God that everybody in Bengali

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:37.800
group should not only Bengali group or Indian group here they will sort of share their views and

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:43.520
walk together that is the only thing that's the way to prosper I think whatever we are doing and

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:49.880
we are doing we are doing very well so I hope we haven't got any complaint on that I hope

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:56.880
we'll stay a few years more to enjoy your festivity the things you do that's all I think

00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:13.120
that I would say at the end number 11 anything else you like to talk about yeah number five

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:27.000
is the what major challenges you faced while arranging or organizing puja the these challenges

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:38.400
are really very controversial as we are very old and afraid and we can't do physically lot of work

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:52.480
for the puja which we did before lot of challenges and criticism come and to say a few words what

00:27:52.480 --> 00:28:03.200
challenges are coming major challenges those who are religious and Brahmin and doing puja they are

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:14.760
telling why you were out the we do person to do vogue we do that's not our sastra that not our

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:22.720
sastra written that they will go I said look don't criticize this thing we short of people we can't

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:31.360
get any people and she's religious she comes and does these things so forget about it no we can't

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:38.880
forget these things second thing is this again they said that their widow why you allow in the

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:50.680
presence to touch the bit and the ingredients and all the pots and everything I said there they came

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:58.600
they they offered their offerings so the religious people also forget about this with a mature and

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:07.000
intelligent judgment you will have to proceed and console them that forget these things these are

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:18.000
the these we listen as long as all are offering our puja in the same manner so let them do it they are

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:25.480
also human being unfortunate their widow so you can't send them there you can't do it you just

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:34.160
you put a fight shall you with a black border and side one side don't touch any and make

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:41.560
matrimonial affair don't touch it because this is auspicious the war auspicious doesn't come here

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:51.320
so forget this thing so these are the preliminary challenge we always listen and console them in a

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:59.400
proper way so that we could work together in a harmonious way and sustain these things so

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:08.520
that it can continue for a long long time and now the 11th anything else you like to talk about

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:19.520
well as Krishna you always you mentioned about the venue venue we talked time and again some

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:30.960
people are willing to give quite a bit of fun to buy land but land is not the only answer you

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:40.640
will have to prepare the whole building then comes it and their building is done then electricity

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:49.760
then rate rain then the priest who will where you stay these are all these things come sing and

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:57.840
it is a very difficult task as we see in Indian culture there is a priest and they have been

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:06.920
permanent they are so all these things are very difficult as so deep says the puja pretty by is

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:17.240
now been making so the priests come from India they got to think where they will stay where they

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:25.440
will eat where they will they apart from their journey from going from Calcutta to UK UK to

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:33.920
Calcutta back all these things suppose they are ill who will stand together and do all these things

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:42.400
you got to think a lot of things so we love to have some our own venue so we can say that

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:52.400
well as Pujya Comte has this venue we never had to think separate kitchen separate venue for the

00:31:52.400 --> 00:32:01.760
for the home another kitchen and the long waiting room and stage where the cultural function will

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:10.000
be dressing changing room from one actor to the other actor so many things in a minute so it is not very easy
