00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, we are quite keen to.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I am Sandip Raha from OSH Puja Committee. I am the Chair of OSH Puja Committee at present.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I am at Kamal Daya and Sikta Bodhi's house in Cardiff, Mr. Kamal Ghatok.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Mr. Ghatok, I heard and know that you were the first few people starting Durga Puja in Cardiff.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Can you tell us how and when you got involved in the festival?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Okay, in Bangla, there was no Durga Puja before.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I was a friend of yours, my flatmate was Sambudars.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
He said that there was no need to do all this.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We started the festival.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We thought that we would get a good result.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Mr. Mooliram, we were very happy.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Then, we started Durga Puja without the festival.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:34.000
First, we went to the temple from Cardiff, London.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Then, I was challenged to be a Thakur.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I was a Thakur in many places.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Then, I became a Saraswati, a Kathipa, a Durga.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
You had made a Durga Puja in your garage, right?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Yes.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
You had made five Pujas.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I remember Madhugga, Lokhi, Saraswati, Kartikeyan, Ganesh.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Yes.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Tell us about that.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
How did you start your business?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
How did you manage to make money?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I came from the office and started working.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I was able to make money by hand.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I am still working.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
You had made Thakur yourself.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
You had made the soil, soil, and the wood.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Yes.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I used modeling clay to make Thakur.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
The film is still there.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I will show you the film.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Do you remember the year?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Which year?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
1978 or 1979.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
No, no, no.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
It was the beginning of 1982.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
After the beginning, the soil was very slippery.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Okay.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
It was the beginning.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I was only three or four years old.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
It was the beginning.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
It was 1984, 1985, 1986.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I remember that I saw your first Puja in the Kadi festival.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
In the Kadi festival?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Yes.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I remember it was 1988, 1989.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I was in the Kadi festival.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
But the Puja was in the Kadi festival.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Can you tell who were the people at that time with you?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Who were the people with you at that time?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
There was one, Ravi Shaukal.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Dr. Ravi Shaukal.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
There was Benraj Jidya.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Dr. Asad Jodha.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Dr. Asad Jodha.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
He helped us a lot during the Puja.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
What about Rama Chaudhary was there?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Rama Chaudhary was there.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Okay.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
When I left him later,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Okay.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Then Rama took over.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Rama was...

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Rama was...

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
He was a part of the cultural program.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
He was a part of the cultural program.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
He was a part of the cultural program.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
He was a part of the cultural program.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Who was the first person to perform Puja for the first 3-4 years?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Dr. Asad Jodha.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Okay.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Then there was Benraj Jidya.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
He started performing at the parade.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Okay.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
He was doing Puja for the Upatala Nishthala.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
He was doing Puja for the Upatala Nishthala.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Can I ask you something?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Okay.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Where did you perform Puja before the parade?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Before the parade,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Before the parade,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Dr. Sen,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
He performed Puja once at Sen's house for a year.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Okay.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Then,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
We performed at the parade.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
We performed at the parade.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
It was a very successful Puja.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
It was a very successful Puja.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
At that time, at the Puja,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
You can say it in Shikhtabodi,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
How did you arrange food for the Puja?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
The food was...

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
...for the people.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I cooked once at the parade.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
I think.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And all the boys did it.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Girls couldn't do it properly.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
There was a kitchen downstairs.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Basement.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
And the sister-in-law made sweets.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And you...

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
...at that time,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
What was the Puja's date?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Do you know where it was?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
The Puja's date?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Oh, that is...

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Father,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Debasis,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Guha Niyalgi.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
No, that was the Kali Puja.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
In Kali Puja?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
The Puja's dates were in the second Puja.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
The fruit was brought from the market.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Flowers, fruits,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
From where?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
From the market.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Yes.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
I brought it from the market.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I brought the fruit from there.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Yes.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And what was the date?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
The date of the Puja's date.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
It was in the month of the month.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
It was in the month of the month.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
It was in the month of the month.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Then they gave us something.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Then, why did it happen?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And where did the money go?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Where did the money go?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I knew that

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
In the village,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
No Puja could run the business.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
No Puja could run the business.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
I see.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
I started that

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
in the Hindu village.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
I started that

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Then I asked, what will happen?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
I said,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I will pay the money.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
I will pay the money.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
But, the rice,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
It will not be taken.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
It will not be taken.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
In the Puja period,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
The rice

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
It will be taken and packed.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And did you collect the money

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
from the houses of the people?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Did you collect anything?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
No.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I did not collect anything from the houses of the people.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
I gave whatever I could.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
I did not collect anything.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And you

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
What you remember,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
What you remember,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
There is a specific event

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
During Durga Puja,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
What you remember,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
There is a specific event

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
What you remember,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
What you remember,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
I remember

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I remember

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
When I made the potima,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
There was a group

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
There was a group

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
There were seven or eight children

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
They said

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
The potima does not need any help

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
The potima does not need any help

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
But

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
But

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
The potima does not need any help

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
That is what I remember

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
There is a hole

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
There is a hole

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
So I still

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I still do not go to Puja

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
I still do not go to Puja

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
That is what I remember

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
But I still do not know

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Because of the game

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Because of the game

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
You made the potima

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
You made the potima

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And that image was

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Worshipped by West Puja Committee

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Worshipped by West Puja Committee

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I knew

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
That was

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Worshed for nearly

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Six, seven years

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
