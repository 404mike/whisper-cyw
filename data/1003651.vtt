00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Well, I've been asked to introduce the children, and I got most, because last year I was asked to, and I totally forgot all their names. I was so nervous, even my grandchildren.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So anyway, this is Michael and Jason Lehmann, and Adam and Oren Hunt, they're my grandchildren.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Donna McDonald and Ryan Ducey, Donna's mother is Dr. Jessica, and Ryan's mother is Jennifer, who's in our choir.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And I think you all know that in Wales, children singing is so much appreciated. They start early, and they're included in shopping services, concerts, and in the store.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And many of you remember singing this in in the chapel, and we want to carry on that tradition.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And I think you can all imagine the work and effort that mothers put in.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So we've got, this is the most difficult children's song that we have really realized, but it's so familiar to us.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So all the children go very high, and such is their power. And so they're going to sing, and they look far.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I'm just keeping a plan.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I am not just what I'm doing.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I'm just one easy man.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
There is a risk of fun and noise.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I'm hot when I die.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Oh, I'm a young good drop soul.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
