00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
I'll ask you a little question to keep the narrative going.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.160
Somali, you said your father was a self-made man.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.480
Can you tell me, when he came to Uganda,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.800
did he come to work on the railways,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.400
or did he come for other purposes?

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.640
And then how did he create his wealth?

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.200
So he came to, it wasn't the railways.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.840
My father came with setting up his own business idea.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.960
So he had like a retail business,

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.240
and he would import products.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.160
And every time, you know, my sister and I went to the shop,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.640
he had a great big black chair, the boss's chair.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.800
So I used to love twirling around in it.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.600
It was very special to sit in his chair.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.400
And he would either give my sister and I a pencil

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.080
and any of the female cousins who went, talcum powder.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.800
And I've still got the talcum powder box he gave us.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.360
So he would always give us a little bit of something.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.240
And he had loads and loads of products.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.600
And he would do like wholesale type work as well.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.480
So he would supply other people.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.600
And incredibly gifted man.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.960
So he became very, very wealthy through that way.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.200
But the good thing about my dad

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.040
was he helped other people as well.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.520
Like he would say to my young uncle,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.800
who I always used to call him cacu cacu,

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.240
the youngest cacu cacu I used to call him.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.000
My youngest uncle used to say,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.280
oh, when the girls are 20, you know,

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.680
think about finding a suitable match for them.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.200
Don't leave it too late.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.840
And he would always advise.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.840
And he would always try and find matches for people.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.120
Or he'd say, my brother's son is, you know,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.120
getting his this age and we're looking for a girl for him.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.200
And you know, he would always help out

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.680
because you had to marry in the community.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.680
And it wasn't like how it is nowadays

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.520
with Facebook and social media.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.480
So it was all connections and he was highly connected.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.160
But very kind person.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.720
And he also used to lend money to people.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.920
And everything was done on trust.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.000
So people would respect him

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and he would help people set businesses up.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.400
So he would lend money and then they would,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.240
they would always give the money back.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.360
You know, it was always respectfully done.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.360
Right, so with regard, my community that I come from,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.920
it's the Luana community,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.920
which is like the business people really.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.080
Mainly they did business type of work.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.160
So all my, everybody I knew were either in business

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.840
and a lot of my cousins were in medicine

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.360
because in Sanskrit, you know,

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.960
it's a great honor to work in medicine

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.760
because you're serving humanity.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.080
But of course, nowadays it's not seen like that.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.000
It's more about status.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.920
But that was the original Sanskrit thinking

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.320
about humanity and looking after,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.880
looking after other people.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.880
So with regard, the family, there is family in India.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.240
So I did go back to India because mom couldn't go.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.040
She was a bad, poorly controlled diabetic.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.040
But I did go and see my auntie, who's her older sister,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.280
in Gujarat because mom couldn't go.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.120
And I went and I also went to see the house

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.160
where mom grew up and I was really shocked to see

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.920
that it was literally a grain store.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.440
And the shopkeeper opened the house up for me

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.360
and it wasn't a house as such.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.880
It was a downstairs and an upstairs open plan.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.560
That's all that was there.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.640
And it was literally a grain store now,

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.200
but they lived there.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.280
So many brothers, sisters, her mom and dad,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.960
and two brothers and four sisters.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.000
So that sister, my mom's older sister,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.640
always stayed in Gujarat.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.680
So it was a great honor to meet her.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.760
She's passed away.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.760
My youngest auntie from my mother's side lived in Kenya

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.240
and I went to visit her years later.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.560
And then subsequently she moved to London as well.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.520
So, and there is some family still in India,

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.800
but because my mom's parents have died

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.400
and her sister has passed away,

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.240
the connection's a little bit loose.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.920
But I'm sure if I was to go and introduce myself,

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.320
you know, people would be thrilled.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.320
And I also went to Singra where my dad's family came from.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.320
And I went to the farmhouse and I explained who I was

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.320
and they remembered me, not me, they remembered my dad.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.880
And they gave me a piece of wood

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.960
because the door that had been there for hundreds of years

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.640
was actually coming away.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.840
And I said, can I have a piece of wood from this door?

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.560
So I had that piece of wood.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.080
My mom's town, my mom's village, Ravel,

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.880
she remembered a clock tower and that's still there.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.480
So I was able to take photographs and show mom,

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.360
you know, and I showed photos of her older sister.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.320
So she was thrilled.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.920
And mom always missed India as well,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.480
but she said when my sister and I were born,

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.520
she said she missed her parents and the village is less.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.760
And so she said, I don't know what I'd have done

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.640
without you two.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.080
If I hadn't have had you two,

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.240
my life wouldn't have been worth anything really.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.360
And no, my mother never went back to India

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.560
because, you know, it's very difficult really

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.520
to go back there.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.240
So for example, my auntie, when she lives there,

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.000
she's literally living in a,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.760
they've got a courtyard with lots of families living there.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.320
And basically it's one room, you know,

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.520
it's a lot of poverty there.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.840
And even her son couldn't come to meet me

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.680
even though I'd gone thousands of miles

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.520
because he was running the shop.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.280
And, you know, if you lose one deal in the shop,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.080
it could be one less mouth you could feed almost, you know.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.280
So it was just lovely to see my auntie.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.240
And I was able to give her some money.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.280
And, you know, she cried.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.680
She didn't want to accept it,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.600
but it was what my mom would have wanted as well.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.880
And it was good for her to know that, you know,

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.520
that I'd gone, you know, it's my older auntie

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.760
that I'd gone to visit.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.680
So I was able to show mom the photos.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.720
And people remembered my mom and my dad.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.600
And one of my mom's friends actually came up to me

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.000
because everybody finds out when you go to India,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.320
everybody wants to know who is this stranger,

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.800
who is this person from England, as they say,

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.280
because they don't know much about other parts

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.520
of the country, Wales, for example.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.160
And people just gather around.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.720
And I found my mom's school friend.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.200
She said, I remember I went to school with your mom

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.240
and the tree where they used to study, that's still there.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.480
So it was just lovely to be able to say to mom,

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.240
I saw these people and take photographs and show her.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.560
So it was nice to do that.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.200
So then going back to the military coming around,

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.800
my mom never did the suicide threatened again.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.640
And she gave my sister and I food.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.960
And we, my sister and I sat together and we held hands

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.760
and everything was fine.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.320
But the white dress she was wearing was never seen again.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.840
So we didn't want any of those memories.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.520
And mom, I think, realized and had a shock.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.520
And I look back as an adult now

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.600
and I realize how depressed she was.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.800
And she was trying to keep a house over,

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.640
you know, my dad's house really.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.000
And she's trying to keep a roof over our heads

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.560
and how difficult it was to keep that.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.040
And then the night the military came,

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.680
we were absolutely petrified, the three of us.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.000
And the news was sent around because they come with guns

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.400
and they can assault people.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.520
They can't just fire.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:47.520
And there was a lot of, you know, trucks going up and down,

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.560
all sort of tree branches, you know, through the trucks,

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.800
trees hacked down and to make things look more threatening,

00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.120
frightening with guns and guns being fired.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.680
And Mrs. Manick has said to mom, the headmistress next door,

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.880
don't open the door, just stay quiet, you know,

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.680
because some families had left.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.920
So obviously there wouldn't be an answer on the door.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.480
So we were well advised really, but mom was so petrified.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.600
And out of 50, 60 people, extended family,

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.080
male members, male cousins,

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.000
Suru, my brother, we rang around,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.240
mom rang around and said,

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.880
can one of you come and stay with us the night?

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.520
Because obviously we weren't going to be able

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.040
to relax or sleep.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:41.040
And not a single male person came to stay with us that night.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.560
Nobody wanted to come.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.480
And obviously you look back and you think,

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.080
yeah, every person would have been frightened,

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.320
but what about an uneducated widow

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.240
and her two small children and the man?

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.040
And the man being obviously always been credited

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.400
with a lot more strength.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.400
And the man having always promised dad as well,

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.360
we look after them, we look after them.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.680
They all said that to a dying man even,

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.640
we will be looking after the girls and mom.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.920
So there was no problem, no worries.
