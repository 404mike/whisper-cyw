00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280
The Photo Search This particular episode in our life illustrates

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:12.160
the strange forces of coincidence that seems to centre on the island of Crete. One winter

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.200
evening in Greek school at home in Sussex, Christina, one of our class members, handed

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.600
us a large A3 black and white photo. It showed a typical small Cretan fishing boat complete

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.280
moored close to the shore, with a corner of a stone building in the background. My husband

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.120
took this when we were staying in Crete in the 1970s. He thinks it's your village. We

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.920
thanked her for the photo and took it home. Later in the year, when sorting stuff out

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.240
in the house, the photo resurfaced and we thought we should bring it with us to the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.720
island to see if we could identify the location or the fisherman, although this seemed quite

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.840
unlikely after all this time. A few days into our next stay, we remembered to take the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.480
photograph into town with us and tried to tie down the location. We didn't know whether

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.840
the places that were used for moorings had changed over time, but there were a couple

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.960
of likely places where stone buildings were near to the shore. A brief discussion in the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.440
first cafe suggested the road towards the causeway by the old carob factory. We knew

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.840
this location as it had recently been opened as a lovely restaurant and had quickly become

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.080
one of our favourites to eat at. When we arrived there, Dimitri, one of the co-owners, became

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.760
very excited and took a photo over to the edge of the building that butted onto his

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.120
restaurant and pointed out to us that the wall shown in it was the same as in the photo.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.440
He asked if he could borrow it and copy or scan it to display on the wall of the restaurant.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.680
We readily agreed and said we would collect the original the following week, but asked

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.960
him if he knew or could find out who the person was in the photo. A few days later Dimitri

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.000
called to us as we were walking past and returned the photo, but admitted he had not been able

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.880
to find out the identity of the mystery fisherman, perhaps he was no longer in town or even no

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.480
longer alive. It was hard to exactly put an age on the fisherman, he appeared to have

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.320
a good head of black curls and was probably between mid-20s and mid-30s, so if the photo

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:25.480
was taken in 1975 we were looking for a 60-70 year old. We walked back to the town square

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.480
and settled down to an iced coffee in our favourite bar. The owner was a local lad,

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.800
like so many in the town, but probably far too young to recognise the mystery fisherman,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.000
but when we told him the story he quickly entered into the spirit of the quest. I don't

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.720
readily recognise him, but my father might, we'll ask him shortly when he calls by.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.960
When his father arrived there was a close scrutiny of the photo, with the necessary

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.120
swapping of reading glasses from distance ones. It could be George, he normally walks

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.560
this way most mornings. In a moment of pure coincidence George was spotted on the other

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.920
side of the road carrying his shopping and walking next to the harbour. Nictalius ran

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.960
towards him carrying the photo, followed at a more sedate pace by his dad. As he approached

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.920
the suspect he slowed and after a short conversation over the photo they returned to the bar. No,

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.240
it's not him, but there is Manolis who is the right age and has curly hair, maybe we

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.920
should ask him the Caffeineon. This was a good suggestion, but a little intimidating

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.760
as the most popular Caffeineon in town was certainly full of potential suspects on a

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.280
daily basis. Although we used the Caffeineons in the village, the two in town had always

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.960
looked too Cretan and full of local men, smoking, playing backgammon and drinking their thick

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:53.600
black Greek coffees and rackies. Also conversation was conducted at high speed and high volume

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.320
with gesticulation bordering on violence. It was still rare to see obvious non-Greeks

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.440
I'm sure we would have been made welcome. The idea of trying to identify a stranger

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.000
from 30 plus years ago with the help of 20 plus Cretan pensioners fuelled on nicotine,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.080
strong alcohol and caffeine was not an immediately attractive prospect. Wisdom suggested we would

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:24.160
defer the task for another day. A few days later our curiosity again got the better of

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.920
us and we tried another approach. The shop next to the most popular Caffeineon is owned

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.360
and run by a couple that we have chatted with over the years that we have visited their

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.560
town. They are English as far superior to our Greek and we wondered if George would

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.600
be a good interpreter to attempt the extension of search of the Caffeineon. After exchanging

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.280
the use of pleasantries and inquiring about families, business and progress on our house,

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.040
I produced the photo. After a short scrutiny there was a feeling that he was familiar.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.040
Eleni suggested that her mother may have a better idea so she was summoned from her chair

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.680
outside for her opinion. This suggestion provided something of a breakthrough. Eleni's mum

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.080
took one look at the photo, laughed and said, Michalis Mathiakis and something else which

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.240
George translated for us. She says it's not a recent photo. So he was still alive,

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.240
still in town? Where? It was suggested that he lived somewhere off the main road south

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.800
of the town, opposite the Causeway Road and in a house somewhere behind the restaurant

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.640
with a pizza oven. Pretty specific directions then. We would follow them up before any other

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.960
theories on identity were offered. That afternoon we drove to the south end of town, parked

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.760
by the nearest restaurant opposite the Causeway junction and went inside looking for a pizza

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.040
oven. Once we established that one of the three staff appeared to be decorating the restaurant,

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.680
that we were not actually in the market for a mid-afternoon pizza, in fact looking for someone,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:05.280
the now familiar photo scrutiny ritual began. After a few moments the trio broke into laughter,

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.720
eventually explaining that yes it was Michalis, he lived nearby, the last house up the hill at

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.160
the side of the restaurant. No need to drive, it's nearby. Again the comment was added,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.680
it's not a recent picture, followed by more laughter. We walked up the hill and around

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.200
two corners and came to a large two-storey traditional style house with a wraparound balcony

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:33.600
and blue shutters behind a metal gate and high railings. This must be it, so we opened the gate

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.280
and walked through a beautiful garden full of vegetables, flowers and fruit trees.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.400
We rang the doorbell and waited but there was no answer. Some brick steps led around the side and

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:50.160
upstairs to another door with a bell but again there was no response. Disappointed we left,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.920
was it the right house? As we came out a woman walked by who we recognised as someone who led

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.040
her sheep past Maria's apartment when we used to stay there. They were taken to graze up on the

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.640
hillside and brought back in the evening. We asked if this was the house of Michalis Mathiakis,

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:14.320
yes of course, we planned to return and try again. It took two more visits before the evening that

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:20.880
the door was answered by a man with a smiling but puzzled face and receding curly grey hair.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:26.000
The brief conversation was curtailed by Michalis laughing out loud at the image of a very much

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.600
younger self in the photo. His wife was called and introductions were made with some confusion

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:37.520
caused by our very haunting Greek and their virtually non-existent English. Nevertheless,

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:43.360
we were ushered within. Please sit down, what would you like to drink? We settled on orange juice,

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.320
partly because we knew the word for it in Greek but also because clear heads would be needed for

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.920
the conversation. The house was large and cool with a polished marble floor and comfortable

00:07:53.920 --> 00:08:00.080
furnishings in a typical Greek style. We explained that a friend in England had given us the picture

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:06.560
and we believe it was taken over 30 years ago in Elunda. He pointed out the window to the part of

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.680
the coast where the photo was taken. It was the building next to the old carer factory and we

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:17.600
think he said that he still had the boat. The conversation was interrupted by Mrs Mathiakis

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.560
who was stocking up the coffee table with methesdas in between laughing again at the photo.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:29.280
These included chopped cucumbers, olives, daikos with tomatoes and peppers and it wasn't long

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.920
before the inevitable carafe of Raki and a tray of small shot glasses appeared,

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:40.320
so much for keeping a clear head. The conversation slowly arrived at where we lived and after a

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:45.360
diversion to England we explained about the small holiday home in the village above the town.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.720
I have a house there as well, explained a surprised Michaelius. Where is yours?

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.160
This part always proved difficult as we had to give directions to a house without a number

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:02.000
or a name in a street with no name. We gave our normal description of the turning between the two

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.680
cavernions and down. More surprise. Mine is also there, much laughter. We appear to be neighbours.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:16.400
Conversations continued in a combination of our halting Greek and hand signals supplemented by

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:22.720
photos on my iPod. All the time Michaelius and his wife, both of whom had beautifully open faces and

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:28.560
ready smiles, asked the usual questions that are quickly asked in creep to the surprise of more

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.840
reserved northern Europeans. How old are you? Do you have children? How old are they? What do you do?

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:40.000
This revealed that Michaelius was 65 and he reckoned he was 30 when the photo was taken.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:46.080
Eventually our Greek vocabulary exhausted and our stomachs full we attempted to leave.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:52.800
You must come up and see our house in the village. We believed his reply was positive but were

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:58.400
surprised to hear that they were visiting in one hour's time. We must leave and prepare some food

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:04.880
to welcome them and tidy up. This was easier said than done. Eleni disappeared into the kitchen and

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:10.720
quickly re-emerged carrying two bags. One was full of fresh lemons from the garden and the other

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:17.360
full of large brown eggs. As we left the house we made the mistake of admiring the flowers in the

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:22.560
garden and our leaving was interrupted by the cutting of a huge bunch of flowers to take.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:28.320
They were pink and white amaryllis, the sort that had grown at home one at a time indoors in a pot

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:34.480
at Christmas. Here they filled a flower border. As we left through the gate laden with gifts and

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:40.160
said our goodbyes a young man got out of his car and walked towards the gates. Michaelius called

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:45.200
him over and introduced him as their nephew who turned out to be a civil engineer working at one

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:51.280
of the large new hotel developments just up the coast. To our relief he spoke perfect English

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:57.120
and understood about the photo and his uncle coming to see us. He also corrected our understanding of

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:03.200
the return visit. It would be tomorrow at nine o'clock not tonight. So much for our Greek what

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:09.120
else had we got wrong? The next morning we were up early and tidied the little house after our

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.880
breakfast on the roof terrace. The flowers were in our largest jug. We'd yet to acquire a frown of

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:21.120
ours and we were ready to receive a visit from our new friends. They were on time and also not

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:26.560
empty handed carrying a large bottle of olive oil, their own pressing so we believed. There was more

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.760
laughter and pointing by Michaelius to the other side of the street across the two metre wide

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:38.400
alleyway. Eventually the penny dropped. The house opposite was his. While the building work went on

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:43.360
the architect had arranged the use of a store room for building materials in the house opposite,

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:48.240
a sort of basement room. It wasn't clear to us where the front door of the house was and whether

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:54.320
it was part of the occupied house that backed onto it. We knew that house lived in by yet another

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:59.520
Maria. Some time ago we'd asked the architect whether it was possible for us to continue to use

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:05.280
this room which seemed separate from any other house. It would be useful for storage which given

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.320
the size of our house would be a great help. It appeared that through a distant coincidence we'd

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:16.400
blundered upon the owner ourselves and he was our new friend. Coffee and orange juice was offered

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:21.600
round with biscuits and we showed our new friends around the house. The bathroom tiling and the glass

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:28.320
floor caused the usual surprise but all in all the house was judged as au rea, as beautiful.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:35.200
The view from the roof terrace with the panoramic distant views was enthused over and we tried to

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:40.480
explain that this has provided the design stimulus for the house with the need for access coupled

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:45.840
with the requirement to get light down into the house. Having shown them around our house it was

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.240
indicated that we should look around the house opposite so finishing our drinks we followed

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:56.720
Michalis around the corner where he climbed a small set of stone steps and produced a key unlocking

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:02.800
the door into the upstairs of the house opposite. The house was still furnished though the cobwebs

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.880
suggested that any occupation was not recent. It was a series of upstairs rooms leading one from the

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.680
other, four in all with the window that was blocked in the third one that would face our house.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:21.120
The last one, the kitchen, had a window towards the sea and a door onto a small balcony. Furniture

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:26.800
was the traditional creedner style including a tablecloth still on the table. The second room

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:32.240
had a round brick wall in it that was apparently a well. It was an education and strange to think

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:38.000
that our own house was the other side of the wall across the narrow street. Our grief recovery

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.520
didn't allow extensive discussion of interior design details so after hopefully showing the

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:50.080
right amount of polite enthusiasm we all came back out into the street but the house view was not yet

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:56.080
over. Eleni led us back up the street towards the church and after exchanging greetings with

00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:02.960
Zambia outside her caffinier and I think a promise to return she directed us up a set of stone stairs

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:08.800
and unlocked the first story door. We believe she said this has been a house that was used to belong

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:14.480
to her aunt but wrestling with verb tenses was proving one of the greater grammatical challenges

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:20.320
of the Greek language. She opened up and we went in. It was a large room and once she opened the

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:26.720
shutters we could see a table and chairs, a 50s style kitchen unit, several large trunks and a full

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:33.360
size weaving loom. The electricity was still connected and she said it was for sale but before

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:39.520
we got into negotiations or worse any commitment to buy we quickly explained that our one Greek

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:44.560
house was plenty for us. There have been moments in the previous years when that seems a surplus

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:49.600
to be honest. Stephanie was particularly taken by the contents of the trunks that had been opened to

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:56.400
show rolls of fabric and pieces of embroidery. This was the second house in the village that had been

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:02.160
found to have a loom in it. Perhaps this was typical or were we in some textile centre of the

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:07.760
island. We were also shown up downstairs and a throwaway remark was made that seemed to suggest

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:13.440
the ownership of several other village houses. We suggested beating a retreat back to the safety

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:19.360
of the cavernion but concluded that the sales pattern was very low key and almost incidental.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.800
We were also selfishly thinking of a way to bring up the subject of the storeroom opposite

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:30.720
but felt it wasn't the right time and concluded it should be left until a later visit as currently

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:36.480
we only had the pithery, one old wooden box and a few old wooden shutters that needed storing

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.000
and thought we would probably leave them out in the alleyway until our next visit.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:46.720
A few days into the next visit we were walking out from the house to the hire car to drive out for

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:52.400
the day when we were called with the cheery calimera and it was Michaelis and Eleni getting

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:58.160
out of their car near the church. We explained in our best Greek that we were back again for a few

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:03.280
weeks and agreed that we would meet them again. Come to my house again when you're next in town.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.600
We agreed that we would with some slight trepidation at the thought of trying to

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:12.400
discuss rent in the storeroom and wondering if our phrasebook or dictionary covered the

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:19.440
correct terms for storage and old junk and other useful terms. Later that same week,

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:24.240
after a few hours resting with the Greek dictionary and our phrasebook, Stephanie announced that she

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:30.240
prepared a letter in Greek to explain our request to rent this small room having discovered the

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:36.640
Greek word for a storeroom, an apotheke. Fortified with this new information and bearing gifts of

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:43.040
wine and biscuits, we paid an early evening call on Michaelis and Eleni. The welcome was warm and

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:48.720
chairs and tables were pulled out onto their large balcony, whereas the sunset we engaged in

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:54.880
mutual misunderstandings in Greek and broken English. Less naive friends had already instructed

00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:00.160
us in the art of Greek negotiating and we'd been given clear advice on not settling on the

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:05.520
first price offered and to be tenacious including the need for essential hand and head gestures.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:11.440
Of course this became less clear once the wine had been opened and poured along with the inevitable

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:17.600
raki in the veritable freest of Ms. Eddard's. Michaelis was invited to read the letter which

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:23.040
he did accompanied by some smiles and chuckles. We awaited the response while we tried to summon

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:28.400
up the Greek negotiating secrets that had been supplied to us earlier. They proved completely

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:34.000
unnecessary. If we understood Michaelis correctly he was saying we must just use the space

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000
for free. We were friends and no rent was expected. This was very generous and completely

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.600
undermined our negotiating strategy. Our only concern was whether we'd completely misinterpreted

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:51.600
the response but concluded this would have to be cleared up another time as the wine and the raki

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:58.160
were already conspiring to make clearing anything up a bit tricky. After several hours our Greek

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:03.840
and drinking capacities were exhausted and we made our goodbyes and headed home but not before

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:09.200
a date was made for morning coffee in the village Cafferney on the following Sunday morning. Perhaps

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:14.800
this would be an opportunity to confirm our storage arrangements. Who knows? We walked off

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:20.160
towards our house not entirely clear whether we were Greek shed owners or not. Things were

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:26.320
never straightforward or predictable here. Maybe that's what we liked. We decided to avoid moving

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:32.000
any items into the neighbouring stone shed until the arrangements were possibly confirmed

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.880
and hoped to do that on Sunday over coffee. When Sunday came we made our way up into the centre

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.760
of the village which is only two minutes from our house. There seemed to be a hubbub of conversation

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:50.560
coming from inside Zambia's Cafferney so we went inside. The single room was packed and as our eyes

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:56.080
adjusted to the more subdued light compared with the bright light outside we were hailed across the

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:02.960
room. Jeff, Stephanie, Parmé. It was Michaelis and as we squeezed across the room towards him

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:09.440
others greeted us. Calamara, Calamara. It seemed that knowing Michaelis was an instant popularity

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:15.920
ticket. Zambia came over in a newly laundered pinafore and took our orders, a coffee and a juice.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:21.600
Cheeks were kissed, hands shaken and shoulders patted. Biscuits and cakes were offered by Michaelis

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:26.560
as we squeezed onto the table next to him. Introductions were made but we arrived in the

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:32.160
middle of a number of quick fire Greek conversations and they were far too rapid and complex for us to

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:39.440
follow so we just sat and enjoyed the hospitality, drank our drinks, ate our biscuits and smiled

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:46.400
probably idiotically at anyone who looked at us. Occasionally we heard Michaelis mentioning Greek,

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:52.240
Maria's house and the word for English and new friends but mostly the talk was more sombre

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:57.760
and as people slowly left they came and shook Michaelis's hand. Shortly afterwards Michaelis

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:03.360
rose and pulled some notes out of his pocket and handed them to Zambia. Then he said goodbye to us.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:08.720
The words apothecy and okay were used again but we'd still failed to confirm the arrangements

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:15.360
completely to our satisfaction. Another time perhaps and later we understood a little more

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:20.880
as the same afternoon or one of the obituary notices posted at points around the town we

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.640
noticed the name of Matthiakis. Did this mean that Michaelis was marking the funeral or anniversary

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:32.080
of a relative when entertaining people to food and drink at the Caffe Neon? We felt guilty that we'd

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:38.560
not understood the situation so that we could at least pass on our condolences. In the village a

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:43.600
day or two later we thought of a new tactic. One of the neighbours, a Belgian lady, was something of

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:49.520
a linguist speaking enough Greek to work in one of the hotels. Over a conversation in the Caffe

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:54.480
Neon we explained our dilemma and how we wanted to be certain that the arrangements were all right

00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:00.240
before we started moving stuff into the room. It transpired that she already knew Michaelis from

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:05.920
the church and the Caffe Neon and it was agreed she would ring him up on our behalf. That same

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.880
evening we were walking down to town through the olive groves and stopped to admire an old net at

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:15.840
the side of the path all bundled up but complete with the little cork floats that we'd started

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:20.800
collecting when we found them washed up on the beach. I was just lamenting the fact that my

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:26.720
pocket knife was not with me when we were hailed in Greek by a woman's voice. A woman wearing an

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:32.000
apron emerged from a gateway in the stone wall bordering the olive trees. To our surprise it was

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Eleni, Michaelis's wife. Our pleasure at seeing her again was tempered by the memory that she spoke

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.960
no English at all and that our attempts at limited Greek conversation convinced her on

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:48.640
past experience that we could understand her Greek especially if she spoke to us at 80 miles an hour.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:55.040
Once we'd got beyond good evening and established that all of us and absent Michaelis were well and

00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:01.360
that the weather was still good we were lost. Whatever she was saying was completely lost on us.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:06.640
Was she relaying the content of its discussion that had taken place with Katerina? Who knows?

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:12.320
We shrugged and apologized and tried to leave but she became more agitated and gestured at the land

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:18.720
beyond the walls under the trees and spoke more rapid, dense and sadly unintelligible to us

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:25.120
Greek reminding us again how much work was needed on our language classes. We finally said our

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:31.440
goodbyes and beat a retreat into town for a welcome evening drink. The next development was

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:36.560
when Katerina called to say that she'd spoken to Michaelis and as we'd first thought he was

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:41.680
happy to let us use the apotheke for free we thanked her and mentioned that we'd encountered

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:47.520
Delaney and not understood what she said. Well he may have a chance to clear this up as Michaelis

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:53.120
has suggested that you call round their house in town one afternoon or evening as he's worried.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:58.880
What about? We asked a little angrily. Apparently he'd expressed concern to Katerina that our

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:04.960
belongings may suffer damage from damp or mice if left in store and he would like us to use the

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:11.040
empty house upstairs and give us a key for us to use as it's a safer and more secure store.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:17.200
This presented us with something of a dilemma as we wanted to store some old shutters and original

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:22.640
wood from the building works as well as some outside chairs recently rescued from the municipal

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:28.640
tip. Being concerned that we would be reintroducing rot or woodworm back into our house and damage the

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:34.080
new timber in it but we certainly weren't planning to damage Michaelis's house. The subject would

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:40.000
need delicate discussion. Later that week we were due to leave the island to return to England.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000
We knew that we must meet Michaelis and Delaney before we left and before we placed our treasures

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:53.520
in the storeroom or infested his house with them. We couldn't delay any longer so we found ourselves

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:57.920
early one evening climbing up the hill to his house and walking through his well-stocked garden.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:03.280
There was no need to knock as Michaelis was sitting on his veranda reading the paper.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:08.080
Calamera, hello my friends. We joined him and admired the view of the bay,

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:12.880
glimpsed through some gaps in the neighbouring houses, entered each other and exchanged

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.760
embraces and Delaney disappeared into the house as we sat down and braced ourselves for our Greek

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:22.800
language workout. We'd come prepared having researched with a dictionary and a phrasebook

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:28.480
a prepared statement. It was along the lines of we thank you for your kind offer of the use of your

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:34.080
house for our possessions but they will only be old things and items such as paint ladders and

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:40.720
outside furniture that we have no room for in our small house. Are you sure you don't want to be

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:46.480
paid any rent? We skirted around the fact that we were worried about introducing Greek woodworm

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:51.520
into either of our houses and felt that this had not been an issue in the storeroom as we'd already

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:57.760
noticed an abundance of existing woodworm and my strop is there. Michaelis laughed and as far as

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:03.280
we could tell after putting on his reading glasses and examining the note carefully he seemed to

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:08.800
confirm it was okay to use the apotheke as we were his new friends. Now we will eat.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:16.880
Alaney reappeared and introduced a range of delicious medettas, salads, tomatoes, garlic paste

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:24.080
on rusks, calamari, hard cheeses and boiled eggs. This was accompanied by raki for Michaelis and me

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:29.840
and more gentle wine for the ladies. We sat eating smiling at one another and admiring the

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:36.160
garden and the evening view of the bay and the mountains. Suddenly Alaney became very vocal and

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:42.000
said something that made Michaelis laugh. We didn't understand any of it apart from what sounded like

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:49.200
the word for eggs. Slowly Michaelis asked us whether we liked eggs. As we'd already eaten some that

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:54.960
evening with him we confirmed that we did and said that these were very good. He explained they were

00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:00.800
eggs from their garden in the hills and he and Alaney laughed again. After several wrong turns

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:05.360
we eventually understood that the earlier encounter with Alaney was when she was up at the small

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:12.080
holding feeding the chickens and we had unbeknown to us refused her offer of some eggs. We could

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:18.640
only apologise both for our rude rebuttal to her kindness and for our poor Greek. Michaelis explained

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:25.040
it was of no consequence and all was okay now. So now we were not only homeowners but also enjoyed

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:29.760
storage rights in a Greek shed. Life was good.
