WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.600
We got along in work and although like we're doing very different things now and that has an impact like on when we can meet up and stuff, you've got kids and I'm studying.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.720
You'll have kids soon.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.600
I'm gonna have kids soon, yeah, which will change things again.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.100
Yeah.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:27.040
Which has made it difficult to stay in like close contact because we were kind of operating in different like...

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.240
And I don't drive as well. I think if I drove it'd be easier.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.200
Like because I could just bring you and Shyam and go all you two up to.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.700
Yeah.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.360
Come down for an hour like but it's not viable to come down for an hour when you don't drive

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.600
because this journey is what 20 minutes from where I live in a car but it's like 45 minutes

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.080
on a train and then it's 20 minute walk so like it doesn't work out.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.200
So if we see each other it's like on the weekends.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.520
Yeah and it's for a couple of hours isn't it?

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.920
Yeah we like do it we're doing a thing like seeing something or going somewhere

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.240
because of the practicalities.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.960
Yeah.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.440
But yeah no well I guess that we've stayed in contact because we enjoyed each other's company

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.360
and we we both valued the the friendship and the things we got from that.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.520
And plus you're the best god whatever.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.980
And that.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.100
I'll be honest you know she loves her Auntie Jen.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.660
My godmother.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.900
Yeah she you'll be living with her now carry on.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.460
Tell her that all the time.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.300
She's like I will move there.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.820
I'm like yeah I bet you would as well.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.460
I'm waiting for her to knock on the door.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.460
Come for email Vee.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.460
She ain't living with me then.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.660
Not doing teenagers.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.380
Give her a four-ed.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.220
I think she'll be in teenage years before.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.500
She already is.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.860
She already is honestly.
