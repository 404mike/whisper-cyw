Steve stories. My name is Steve Fletcher and in 1990 I founded Swickr Carnival who have

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:16.880
organised Cardiff Carnival ever since. Steve story number seven. Cardiff Carnival finales

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.880
on the steps of the National Museum of Wales. The highlight of every Cardiff Carnival over

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.360
the past 25 years has been a spectacular costume parade featuring hundreds of flamboyant paraders,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:36.320
dancers and street musicians. However, over the years once the parade has finished there have

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.800
been various opportunities to present finales in different locations around the city.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.280
In the mid 1990s the Carnival camp was hosted at Cateys Youth Centre and the parade route included

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.120
passing through the Civic Centre, past the doors of the Welsh office which was then the seat of

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:03.280
government in Wales. The site chosen for the finale presentation of the Carnival after the parade

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.720
was the steps of the National Museum of Wales. The various landings, levels and ledges of these

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.840
massive steps offered multiple layers of stages and platforms on which to perform and present

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.960
all the many different costumes and dance groups with great sight lines for our family audiences.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.960
Here against the background of the Museum's towering classical pillars and overhanging ornate

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.680
portico, Cardiff Carnival would culminate with a crescendo of massed performance, dance, drumming

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:44.880
and singing. However, our first use of the National Steps Museum steps for the 1993 Cardiff Carnival

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:54.400
which was called Nightmass was almost the last. A key part of that year's finale presentation

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.400
involved a dramatic fight between good and evil. A troop of horned and leering, blood-red, body

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.040
painted devils were armed with powerful pump-action water pistols filled to the brim with scarlet dye.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.640
Their adversaries were a group of singing and dancing angels with large wings

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:21.040
all dressed in purest white. So as the sun began to set the devils proceeded to attack the angels

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.200
and appear to mercilessly slaughter them all. The angels' glowing white costumes were completely

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.960
splattered with fake blood and they collapsed to the floor, much to the horror of our audience.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.720
Naturally the angel dancers were shortly resurrected, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil,

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.880
much to the relief of the younger children in the audience in particular.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:54.000
However, the horror for me was not over. As the next day while passing the steps on the way to

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.840
help with the get out at the carnival camp I realized that the museum steps themselves

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.080
were still splattered with fake blood now disastrously absorbed into the stonework itself.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.200
So whilst our earlier dress rehearsal on the steps had gone smoothly and stain free,

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.200
it was the case that one over enthusiastic devil had mixed a blood-red dye of a stronger brew.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.680
Our agreement with the National Museum of Wales was that the steps would be returned as found,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.160
not tappled with fake blood. Fortunately the museum director kindly agreed to wait three months

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.040
to see if the stained steps reverted to their original condition and, as luck would have it,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.360
lashings of Welsh rain did indeed remove the offending red coloring and all was forgiven.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.840
As part of these finale presentations on the museum steps there would be fireworks and

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.920
pyrotechnic special effects including smoke bombs of every color and the very last moments of the

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.560
finale would be marked by the title of that year's carnival picked out in giant fiery letters

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.320
up on high on the portico roof. These fiery words marked the very last moment of that year's carnival

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.680
and were the cue for all of the hundreds of costumed carnival revelers to return to the

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.080
steps for a final dance and drum whilst the very large family audiences which were normally over

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.080
5,000 strong went absolutely crazy and showed their appreciation the best way possible by

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:39.120
cheering, whistling, clapping and whooping until the last firework had burnt out and darkness

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.120
resumed.
