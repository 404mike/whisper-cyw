00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
He had found work in Hatton Garden and you know how it was with the internment.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If they found the people in, they took them. If not, they often didn't come again.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
That's why a lot of the refugees who had no work would spend their day in the park.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now my father was working in Hatton Garden and my mother said he came home one day at lunchtime

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and she said she went quite pale and said, what are you doing here?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And he said, I've just come for some tools. And that made the bell ring and they came and said,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Mr. O'Hanlon, I'm afraid you have to pay the bill.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And he was taken to the Isle of Man. And just now when my mother died,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I discovered all his letters from the Isle of Man. I didn't know they existed.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
He must have written more or less every other day in German.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And he doesn't complain, but he must have suffered terribly.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Because to have escaped from the Nazis and then to be locked up and away from their mother

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and she in the blitz, it must have been absolutely dreadful.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I know they made some sort of a life for themselves and they played music and they had lectures

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and all sorts of things, but it must have been dreadful for them.
