00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I left school when I was 15 and I started working in the pit when I was, you know, in September.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I was 15 in June, I went to the pit.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
September, because you know, you want to space the time when you want to apply to go in the pits.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
My class to go down the pit.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I went in when I was 15, I went in a couple of months.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Then my training in Boggard, or gallery it was called, and we had blocks there, you know,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
learning us what was going to happen when you go down the pit, eventually get down the pit.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We done a bit of parking and we done road work and things like all the rails and different things

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
before we actually went underground.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Did they teach you a lot of health and safety things?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Oh yeah, they did in a way, yeah.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
There was a lot of, well, because we was young, you know, you had a lot of young boys with us,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000
they didn't want to know, but they were saying we had to rely on each other, you know,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
to get on with it because otherwise if you didn't, you could have an accident, you know,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
which I remember one time he was doing a thing and this boy was just throwing material about

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
which he should have been doing, you know, and when he was told he wouldn't listen,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
so they sucked, they were like, you know.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And do you agree with that?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
You have to listen to what you were told otherwise, like when we eventually went underground,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
it would be too dangerous to do things like that.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And when I went then underground and in the old school and it was called in Bargur itself,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
like and he started to work and they had two different things like again,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:14.000
like learning about safety and all and, you know, and that's how we went,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
we went from there then, we did 16 weeks in there, we also went to college in Aswad Manak,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
at the time he was the first, not the trainee, to go to Aswad Manak College.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And of course because we were to do with the mines, people in Aswad, the other students,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
they would want to do different things, like someone's going in for lawyers,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
someone's going in for to be a doctor and things like that, but because we were miners,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
the teachers didn't like us a lot, to be honest.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Was it because you were miners or because you were disruptive?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
No, I think it's because we were miners, to be honest, and you know.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Did they not think that, you know, you should be in college?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
They more or less favored the other people rather than ourselves, like you know.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So did you manage to pass the college course?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Well, what it was, we wouldn't, like we had boys with us, and it was from the other valleys,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and all, they couldn't even sign their alphabet and all that, they didn't know it, to be honest.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I wouldn't call them dull, but they didn't care because they didn't want to learn like, you know.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Of course they learned their math when we were in college, we didn't do such a thing as,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
like we wouldn't have to be educated as such, like, you know, with them, like to their standards,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
like we were just there as miners because we have to go there and learn a little bit, like you know.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And, well, we went from there then, I went early in scholarly, went down to get there,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:03.000
went into training phase, got on with it there, like you know, and working with this bloke,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
like you know, and he said, you know, he's good fun, like you know, in the long times, like,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
but he was a bit strict, like, and he said, you get him with it one day, and of course,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.000
like he had his accident on his foot, I had an accident on my arm, like, you know, a stone fell and stuck in my arm.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And of course, it was a bit deep, like, and then this fellow come, the other miner come up,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and he had a chewbacca in his mouth, and just spit on it, like, he said, I'll do it.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And I was in, like, you know, I was in, like, you know, but he just laughed it off, like,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.000
but I had to be able to work for a couple of days, like, because I was young, like, I was only 15 at the time,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and he said, you know, you've got to stay home, like, for a couple of days, like, you know.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And did you get paid?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Well, yeah, you get paid, you know, compensation, no compensation, but...

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Sick pay.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Sick pay, yeah, I said, yeah, and, you know.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
So did it heal completely?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Oh, it was alright after a day or two, like, but there was a funny part, like, when he spit the bacca on it,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
like, you know, and just look at it, oh, it did get better, you know, I take the thing, like,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and he just laughed it off, like, you know.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:34.000
But I went from there then to the face, and I ended up as what he called a pick-boy, like, you know,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000
but I was there, punches in the ground, like, and I was, my job then was to look after him, maintain him,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.000
fix him up for the man that was actually on the call in the face to use, like, alright.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.000
So anyway, that was my first job, and when I come out the train and face, I was a pick-boy, like, you know.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Did you enjoy it?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Oh, yeah, I enjoyed it, like, you know, but then you go, well, I went from there then,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I went on the timber for a couple of years because, to be honest, because I was good on the timber,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
they kept me on the timber, right?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
I could have had a job, say, in the face, but they said no, because, like, I just do,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000
they said to get the timber what I wanted, I just go and do it and make sure they had the supplies to do it,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
like, you know, and they paid me the great end, the great end for great ones,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
they could do a not job, you know, because they didn't want to get rid of me as a timber boy,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000
like, I didn't like it, but they didn't want me to, you know, go into the face, like, because...

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Because you were too good at your job.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Yeah.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.000
You know, and of course I was in it, and then I actually went into the face, and I, you know,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and Doubtedheazen bars they was calling, you know, Meetebars and Doubtedheazen, you know,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
they had machine cutting all the coal in, I didn't have to actually dig one of them,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:16.000
because stents as they used to call them, you'd say a 12 foot or 18 foot or 24 foot stents as they did on,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
the better he was, the more you could do, like, and then so they would pay,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
but he was on it, but the machine was cutting the coal, and we'd just put them bars and Doubtedheazen up,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
like, you know, and we had pushers, and he was calling, and he just pushed the machine over,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
it was a lot easier, you know.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And did you...

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Well, it was years before, like, you know, I was lucky I got in at the right time,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
when you did have to really work hard, like, on the coal, see.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And then I went from there then into the road work, like, you know.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
So that was harder than what I was doing on the Doubtedheazen bars, like,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
because you had to use a shovel and you had to pack four things,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and things like that, put the rings up, lock them and things like that.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
This sounds like a hard job in the minefield.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Yeah, but I enjoyed doing it, like, you know.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Then, of course, we had different grades, and he'd come in,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
and when you had different grades, and he'd come in, grade one was 22 pounds,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000
grade two was 18 pounds, and you'd have a bit less if it was a grade three in the road,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
which I didn't agree with, because we still all had to do the same amount of work, really.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And they changed it in the end, and then you all had the same amount of money, like.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
But we were doing different things, like, like, I was in the road,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and then we were doing different jobs, like.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Like, you know, Dr. Cooley was in the team, and they'd say,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
oh, come up the road today, you know, we're going to the face, and then from there,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
then you're going to do other things, like, even sometimes they tell you to go

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
park out and drive things, and things like that, you know,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000
when anything keeps the cold coming out, you know, and that.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Did you know of any people with any kind of disabilities,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
whether it was a learning disability, a physical disability working in the mines,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
or had a disability from an accident?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
I knew some I couldn't read and write, you know, but they got on with the job,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
as long as they could do the work, they didn't care about the education side of it, you know.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
I had buddies that couldn't read and write, they didn't care.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Well, I wasn't too clever myself, you know, but they got on with the job, like, you know.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
As long as they could do the work, they didn't mind, you know,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
they didn't worry about whether they was educated or not, really, like, you know.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
I knew people, like my friend, he had polio when he was young,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and he came into the pit to work, like, you know, and we used to limp a lot,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
like, they gave him a good job, like, you know, he just got on with it and all.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Did they make any allowances? Did you have anything to help him?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Well, you know, they allowed him to work at the ground with us, like, you know,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and we had had polio, like, and his one leg wasn't, you know, right,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
he was limping all the time, like, and as long as he could get on with the work,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
they didn't mind, like, you know, like he did do.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Was there any kind of discrimination against people who did it?

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
No, not really, no. We didn't discriminate things from people.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
The thing is that, as long as they could do the work, and, you know,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
they just got on with it, like, you know, they didn't bother about anything,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
as long as you've done your work.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
It does sound very... Yeah.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
...equalities, you know, everybody's equal when you're down the pit.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
The only thing is, like you're saying about different things that happened

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
when I was here, like, one of my friends got killed in the pit, like, you know,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
he got buried and he died like a stick.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
How did he die? He was not killed. He was winning.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
He was a measuring boy, like, he went into measure,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and the men was having their food outside,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and he went out, and we got all the way, he got tied up in the air,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
and they just clapped, you know, and he got killed that way.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
The friend of mine, he lived in the same street as him, and all that, like, you know, and...

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And was his family compensated?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Well, I don't know why, but we never went into it.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
I know what I mean in them days, like, they did,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
but money meant nothing, like, our compensation really did it, one.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
They lost their son, like, and we lost a friend.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And then another friend, then he got killed in there.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:55.000
One time, like, we played and all that, and he got killed in a nasty way, like, you know.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000
He was dragging rings, he was working on, and he'd been on the electrician

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000
with the outside doing something to the parlance for the, like, cut down his big wheel

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
with the cutter, like, and he'd run down the parlance, and then chopped him up, like.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
You know, well, you know about that now.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
But you know what I mean.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And then I had another friend, then, he was the one of me, got killed with the cutter and all that, you know.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
So I was all in Elliot's pit, like, you know.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And were things changed after these terrible accidents?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Yes. The thing is that really when, what happened was there's, like, you know,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
they were saying it wasn't an electrician's fault and it wasn't nobody's fault, really, like,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
but you know what I mean.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
He shouldn't have, he shouldn't have been working, you know what I mean?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Yeah, they kind of said he shouldn't have been there.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
He didn't know. He didn't even know anybody, even his friend.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
You know, working on for a couple of accidents, you know.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Of course, I was at the place.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Oh, gosh.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
So how did it affect you as a fellow miner? How did it affect you?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Well, it's terrible, isn't it?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
You know, with your friends, like, you don't know.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
You don't want to, well, your neighbour, especially when Les got killed, like, in it,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
because he was so well known, wasn't he?

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
No, Les was, like, in there.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000
They, well, I can't say, you know what I mean, how the family felt, like, you know what I mean.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.000
The way, you know, what happened to him, like, there wasn't much left of him, like, you know what I mean.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Oh, it's terrible.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
But with the other two, at least they had a body, too.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
You know, one body, the other, like, you know.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:08.000
It seems like the amount of tragedy that happens in a coal mining, the camaraderie is kind of, they go hand in hand, I think.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
I think you have to have that kind of camaraderie to cope.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:22.000
You still have to work, you know what I mean, like, you want to work even that up, like, you know, and you know, it's so sad and all, like, but you have to get on with it, like, you know.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
That's really sad.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Well, you know about it.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
See, just get on with the job, like, you know, and always sad and all of it.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Yeah.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
When it's up, then nothing nobody can do about it, like, you know.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Yeah.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And we went, you know, and we went from there and down to Elliot's Clothes, then I went to Bedford's Pit down there.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Down in Bedford's Pit it was different to Elliot's. Elliot's Pit was more like a big family, because we were all, when we went to Bedford's Pit there was a lot of foreigners working, like Poles and Missouanians.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:16.000
They were like, oh, he wasn't the same as us, some of them, you know, because they were more selfish than us in a way, like, you know, like, where we'd say, be doing a job, we'd say, oh, I'm having so much.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Oh, and I am, but they wouldn't tell us how much he was earning, see, you know what I mean? That type of thing, like, you know.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
But if there was an accident, would everybody...

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Oh, if it was an accident, we'd be all together like that then.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Yeah, good, yeah.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
But, like, they'd be selfish, where they wouldn't tell you how much you were earning, like, you know what I mean?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Yeah.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Why not tell us, like, you know, they'd give them rates, they'd get all the work.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:50.000
When I went to Bedford's Pit, I suppose they didn't include one turn at a later point, like belt turning and all that.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:16:06.000
I didn't know nothing about that, because we had to learn on the spot, like, you know, went there, we managed with work, and I like, you know, some of the foreigners, they had to show us what to do, because we'd never seen, like, the other, like, the Kunchum walker machine, it was called.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Like a jigger, you know. I'd never even seen one, I know, I know, tuned it.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:22.000
And they'd have to learn us what to do. And they had to learn on the spot, like, when they would tell us how to do it, they could work on it.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:36.000
And they would do, in fact, they'd say, like, well, they wouldn't finish the job, we had to do other jobs before we turned out, like, get an extra call-off to make sure we could get the machine opening things.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Well, that meant then we'd be late doing it.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Of course, these folks didn't mind, because they knew they could work on, we couldn't work on, because we had to catch a bus to get open up.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:58.000
But they were local, most of them, like, you know, and we didn't mind, like, we still got on with the job, still got on together, like, you know, they were doing all right.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000
But it was good days, like, a bad day, you know what I mean, like, you know.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Your whole experience, would you say, was enjoyable?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Oh, fantastic, I wouldn't change it, but, you know, it was just things that were happening, like, you know, in it.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:37.000
And, like, I had another friend, and he just dropped dead in the ground, like, because I was in his old man to me, like, you know what I mean, and he was just on a switch, as they'd call it, and we went to catch a bus, and he said, oh, where's he gone, and he wouldn't tell us what happened.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Well, by the time he got on, he said, oh, he must be working on, like, you know, and he must have had a lift home, but he had died, like, and he wouldn't tell us.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:18:06.000
So, of course, my friend then, like, he said, oh, I've got to go past his house, and his wife every morning used to be on the door, and we found out in the end, like, that he had died, and they wouldn't tell us anything, you know, before we went.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:16.000
And, you know, the bus started, like, someone slipped up, and oh, he died, you know. He didn't know what to say to his wife.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:34.000
So, one thing, like, I like, you know, it's sad, but, you know, but they get on with it, and then you do different jobs, and, like, you know, you just go back to work the same day, and all, and get on.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:50.000
You have to like it. You can have fun to say, oh, well, he died, so he can't go to work, and you're into the funeral, and things like that, but, no, he don't say, I will offer some of the mine, the pit might turn out in the morning, and say, oh, you can have a day off.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:58.000
But sometimes they turn out and say, oh, you bet you're going to make out, I want to, or whatever, like, you know what I mean. So.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Well, thank you very much.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:16.000
And then, when the pit finished, then, like, and then started off, and we started off with this, he was saying, oh, do you want to come in business with me? He said, what are we doing, Billy? He said, putting toilets down the pit.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:30.000
And then, when we were done with the job, and the bed was picked after the strike in the 1950s, about 55 strike, and we were the first pit to close, and we got a super idea, this was a job anyway, you know.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:50.000
So, we had done a lot of work before we went back into the pits, like, carry on with it, putting toilets down the pit, but they come out there and help in safety, so some pits are to have them put in, you know, you know, you went up to Yorkshire and you said, I don't have them.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:20:05.000
So, we also worked in private mines and all, adrift mines and all that, you know what I mean. When it was for mines, it didn't just in coal, it was the coal, but it was various mines, you know what I mean.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:20.000
And, well, we had the money for it, you know, but the pits closed so quickly, so we had to go into, we were with film companies and stuff like that, you know what I mean.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:38.000
And they were saying, oh, do all the money, but they didn't give us money to do it, we had to pay all the money we borrowed and off of board and all to set it up and all that, we had to pay it all back, they didn't give it to us.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Right.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:47.000
So, which, well, you know, money to do it like that and different things like that.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Okay, thank you very much. Glen, have you got anything to add?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:06.000
The man he was saying about foreigners, Poles and Lithuanians mostly worked for Tysons, which were contractors to the coal board.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:16.000
That's why they were on different rates of money to us. They were on better money, a lot better money, because, yeah, a lot better money than we were on, but they worked the downside out of it too.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Right.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:26.000
They worked, they would do anything, they would do anything, you know, and they worked, like, long hours, but they were, you know, Tysons were...

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:34.000
No, when I done it, when I'm saying this, when we went from Elliot's pit to Bedford's pit, they were supposed to be the same as us.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
They wasn't working, they was working for the board, they wasn't working for Tysons.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
No.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:48.000
They was working for us, for the board, you know, the ones we were, I'm on about that, you know.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:58.000
And, you know, like we're saying Tysons or other, they was hard working and they did do, they deserved their money, because they would do anything, you know.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:05.000
We had a woman, they say they'd be one in junctions and saying, like, which big curders and all that.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:15.000
They knew the work and they knew how to do it, they was working like Tysons and all that, which they did deserve their money for it, you know, and I'm not saying they didn't deserve it.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:22.000
But what I'm saying is, when we was there, when we went from Elliot's to Bedford's, it was a different thing, you know.
