And I will call on them.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Another day in August,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I will call on them.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And I will pray that all of you

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
will come and see me.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
But I will pray that all of you

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
will come and see me.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And I will pray that all of you

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:04.000
will come and see me.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And I will pray that all of you

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
will come and see me.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
That Mary, I love you, the Lord,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
see all what one must want.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
In all the love that I could be,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I will pray that all of you

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000
will come and see me.
