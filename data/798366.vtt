00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.800
So, pear is pear. It's made out of special peri-pears, which is the pear equivalent of

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.720
cider apples. So they're not nice tasty ones. You can't make peri out of conference pears.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.600
The taste is totally different to cider. It's a bit of a love-hate. Some people love it,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.800
some people say, no. I think in recent years it's got very confused by words like pear

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:36.400
cider. Pear cider is a totally different product. It is a sort of appley type cider with a bit of

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.560
pear essence in generally, which is not the same as peri, which as I say is 100% pure pear juice.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.080
Peri is very special to Monmouthshire. Monmouthshire is known as the Peri county

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.400
of the whole of the UK. It's also quite special to sort of areas like Worcestershire, which is where

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.240
my husband comes from, which is I think where his original interest in it evolved. We did have a

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.880
couple of old pear trees. Sadly the original ones died, but we have taken some grafts and they have

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:17.360
been DNA tested, so we will find out what they are hopefully in the next few months. I don't know why

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.880
why do we make so much peri? Because we have access to lots of different pears, I sort of find it more

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.920
interesting to make than cider. You tend to make ciders by blending apples before fermentation,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.000
different types of apples to get the balance. With peri you try if you can to make it as a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.640
single variety product and you do get very distinctive flavours from different types of pear.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.720
I just really like that. I find that very interesting to find out how it comes out. It's

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.040
sort of become our USP in many ways is peri and I'd like to expand on that.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:02.000
So one of the most well-known peri pears is the Blatene red. It originates in Gloucestershire,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.200
but it is widely found in Monmouthshire and I guess other parts of Wales as well. Pairs sometimes

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.800
have quite a lot of unfermentable sugars in them, natural unfermentable sugars, particularly

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.160
sorbitol. The Blatene red has quite a high level of this which means when it's fully fermented it's

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:28.880
still naturally sweet which makes a nice rounded flavour. We also have pears around here known as

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.360
Monmouthshire burgundy pears. There is some debate about whether they're different pears to Blatene

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.840
red or not. We will find out with the DNA results I hope, but they definitely taste different. I can

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.000
say that the peri tastes different, not the pear. The peri is more of a sort of wine class of peri,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.480
slightly drier. Then we have lots of different ones. One of my favourites is the potato pear

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.720
which is quite difficult to use and make good peri out of, but if you do make it well the peri

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:06.880
tastes a very citrusy, it's quite an acidic pear, but it tastes of like limes, really limey. It is

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.640
quite hard to make but it can be beautiful, so that's one of my favourites as well. Probably the

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.400
Blatene red peri which we sell under the name Snowy Owl, that's probably because you tend to

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.720
find that the general public like something slightly sweeter. I use a variety of different

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:30.160
pears for the dry ones. We use quite a bit of thorn pear which ferments very quickly usually.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.040
I think because the pear rots from the inside and it'll actually start rotting while it's still on

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.400
the tree, which means it's pretty much got going with its fermentation before you've impressed it.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.880
And that makes a very light, easy drinking peri which I sell as a dry or possibly a medium,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.400
depending on the year. The sugar levels, the natural sugar levels in the pears will vary from

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.920
year to year, so you can get one product one year that will be really bone dry and the next year it

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.600
will be quite a bit sweeter.
