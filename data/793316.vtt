00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that Mrs. Gale introduced what you called the stage turn.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So, in between the main film and the supporting film, there was an interval.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This was put on and the stage turn was always one of great movement.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Men doing, well, gymnastic jumps and leaps and bounds and climbs and all sorts of things.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And then sometimes there was perhaps wrestling on or something of that kind.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
But it was never, you felt that was a pretty tough job and you got tired of that very interesting.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And there would be straight drama, little scenes of well-known pieces of work down on the London stage

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and extracted and she was very good like this, she was very good.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And who would perform these things?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Well, these are parties, groups or theatre groups from away.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We saw them for three days a week and then they'd gone somewhere else doing their thing, whatever it was,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
on stages in different cinemas.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Because it was again Mrs. Gale introduced this idea as an attraction for her cinema and it caught on.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And they always had this extra, so if the film turned out to be a bit dreary, as some films did unfortunately,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
you always had this attraction of a very good stage show.
