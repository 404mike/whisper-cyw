00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.040
Okay, Kadev's and Nicholas Church, 22nd of March, 2019, George Arrakas interview.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.520
That's interview number five, I think.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.520
So, let me put some light there to see what's going on.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.520
Yes, tell me, where is the light?

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.520
Here it is, there are the lights.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.520
Yes, put it there.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.520
No.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.520
No.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.520
No.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.520
Ah, we saw how it was.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.520
Here is our church, here.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.520
So, our church.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.520
It's two different churches.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.520
This one is from 1960.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.520
That's St. Mary's.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.520
St. Mary's, so that's our church is there.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.520
So, behind the church is the canal.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.520
Yes, that's it, canal.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.520
And this way is Bute Street.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.520
Exactly, yes, Bute Street.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.520
That way, okay.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.520
Now then, about here, the first place that I know, there was a cafe called the Global Cafe.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.520
There.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.520
Global Cafe.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.520
Okay, that's it, they had it in Cyprus.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.520
Okay, they had it in Cyprus.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.520
So, let me turn it around a little bit.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.520
So, this is Bute Street, this is it.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.520
That's the canal.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.520
There was a bridge there.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.520
Here, about here, these shops, most of them were Greek.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.520
And here were two Greek shops.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.520
Here was, let's say, the Lambro, the bakery.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.520
Lambro, I guess.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.520
Yes, Lambro, it was Spiros Lambro.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.520
Okay.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.520
Next to it was Maroukos, which had a cafe.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.520
Yes.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.520
The one that made the bakaliko at the end of it.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.520
There I learned, there I first walked there, to Maroukos, to the cafe.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.520
So, where are we now?

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:13.520
Here, at the end of the block, here, it was again, Lambro opened it in another bakaliko.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:23.520
These bakalikas sold olives, Greek products, I don't know, pasta, which didn't exist then, these years.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.520
The eggless, I don't know what it was, spaghetti, you understand?

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.520
I called it paschetti.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.520
So, in this block was Sofia's cafe.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.520
Here, let me tell you, about here, was Sofia's.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.520
Okay?

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:51.520
There, Sofia went to the cafe, all the sailors were gathered,

00:03:51.520 --> 00:04:05.520
and in Maroukos, all the sailors were gathered, and they went, I don't know, and they were saying, I don't know, their own, let's say, the sailors, I don't know, the others.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.520
Where am I? Here, this is Sofia's.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:20.520
So, there, all the sailors were gathered after the church, all the captains, those who came, instead of being here in the church, they went there.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:26.520
And it was Sofia and Christos. I think it was her daughter.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.520
I think.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:45.520
A little further down, there was a fish and chips restaurant, which had it, a boy, a boy, had it, and then they took it, something, I think, I don't remember his name, I can't tell you.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:05:01.520
Yes, after that, there was another cafe, which was owned by George, and all the Cypriots went there and played poker.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.520
I remember my father's village.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:13.520
And next to it was Michalis Asprou.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.520
I don't know if you've heard of Asprou Travel?

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.520
Yes.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.520
That was his father.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.520
George Asprou, what's his relationship with him?

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.520
His son.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.520
Michalis Asprou.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.520
Michalis Asprou had a small shop there, and he sold various things, it was like a con-shop.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:38.520
And he was married, my aunt was married, a cousin of my father, who was still alive.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:47.520
And they had this shop, I don't know how many years, I don't know, since 1952, they took this shop.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:55.520
And all the other shops were before and after the war, Sofia's war, I'm telling you.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:06.520
And yes, that was it, then they took the next shop and did it twice, but the next shop was a newsagent, who bought it.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:17.520
So we said, there were the cafes, this is this, and here was the channel, where is the channel?

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.520
There is the channel.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:26.520
I remember it, that's the bridge, there is still this bridge there, and I have a photo there, I can send it to you.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:37.520
And there was a pilaria, and opposite was a pilaria, and you go down, and there were the back parts of the church here.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:48.520
And when we got to the church, what is this place, here was the West Canal and the East Canal.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:54.520
Here, here was water.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.520
Yes, yes, that's the Clamorca Canal.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:05.520
So the West Canal, the wharf, was, you came here and you came to pass from here and you went down to the church from here, you didn't come from there.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:18.520
So, here, which is called Crichton Street, and I don't know, were some houses, which were, I tell you, all the Greek community was there, they lived there, around, you understand?

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:27.520
And here were the houses, which I told you, that had a camera in a ship, I don't know, this, you understand?

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.520
This is it, here, here on Crichton Street.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.520
And the same thing was happening in Paris.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:44.520
There were also, how do you say it, boarding houses in Paris, because in Paris, Greeks were gathering, there was something like this.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.520
That's it, that's it.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:08:01.520
And down here, in George, there was another, in James Street, another church, which had it, Jimmy the Greek, I don't remember his name.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.520
Yes, James Street.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:14.520
And in George Street, there was, yes, there was the Calhounic, there was the, how do you say it, the Ship's Channels, which was also in George Street.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:19.520
Okay, I got, when I found Calhounic in the bibliography.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.520
Okay.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.520
He was once a president, many years here, and he was also a famous poet.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.520
Yes.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.520
What can I say?

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.520
Down here, in the lower part of Bute Street, where are we, James Street.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.520
That's West Bute.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.520
West Bute, another.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.520
That's West Bute, and that's the actual Bute Street.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:56.520
And here, this part here, I think, I don't know exactly where it was, but before 1950 and the war, because the war was very Greek here, very, very Greek here, and they left after Greece was liberated.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:16.700
Here were the Ship's Channels, the messengers who, I don't know how you say it in Greek, were the dissidents, the messengers, the

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:22.880
Yes, but they moved the pictures from here, when the port fell here, they went to...

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:30.880
I have spoken with the captain, he told me that he spoke with the sailor and he told me, because then the port was closed.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.880
Of course, and it's down there.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:36.880
No, I spoke with the sailor and he told me that he spoke with the sailor, the sailor was a philosopher, he could speak to me later, so he could tell me about the pictures.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.880
Oh, nice, nice.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.880
And I also spoke with the sailor, who sent me some information, he sent me some pictures.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.060
The sailor has no more pictures.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.060
He has no more pictures.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.060
He has no more pictures.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.060
I don't know his name.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:55.060
As a philologist, I don't know him from before, because in Greece he has even more pictures.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:10:04.060
He was a philologist, and he was a philologist, he was the one whose son gave him 15,000 people in the church yesterday.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.060
Yes.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.060
Do we have a contact with philologists?

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:11.060
No, not with the ship.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.240
But do they have any old photographs?

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.240
No, they must have.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.240
This one was usually in Paris.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.240
This was the painting.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.240
I don't think I had a copy of the painting.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.240
I don't know, I don't think so.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:34.240
The pigmalion that is on the plaque, he was a firefighter and he was a priest in the church.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.240
This is the man who was on the plaque.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.240
He was the captain.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.260
The

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:53.260
people who started the war, most of them were Cassiopeians, Antiochians, and the Cypriots.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
The Cypriots came after the war.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
Kostas, look.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
Thank you very much.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
No, I don't know.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
No, that's exactly what I wanted.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
I wish I knew more.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
If I didn't want a father who was in my life, I would have told you there.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.280
He would have educated you there.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.280
No, it's a joy to gather.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.280
That's exactly what we want to do.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.280
We want to make a map.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.280
Where we can put the census.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.280
If you go to the census.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.280
1911 is it?

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.280
1901 is it?

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.280
I'm looking the director.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.280
I think you might find stuff in the census.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:39.300
It was a George Andriadis.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:51.300
Remember when I told you that it was the Cypriots who had the coffee house?

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:59.300
I think before they took it and made it coffee house, it was a George Andriadis there.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.320
The Cypriots were rafters.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.320
They sold on the steamships.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:09.320
Wherever there was a steamer, they went there with their jacket and shoes.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.320
Because they didn't know how to speak.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.320
They went on the steamer and spoke.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.320
In the meantime, I remember something else.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.320
Down here, where are we?

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.320
In the Beaux Street.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.320
I don't remember the Beaux Street again.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.320
Where we talked about the lamp.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.320
Where is it for the lamp?

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.320
And the lamp here.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:38.340
Here was a brewery called the White Heart.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.340
This brewery was owned by a Greek.

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.340
I think that the father of the Greek,

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:50.340
his father had married a Yugoslava.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.340
Because the Greek was half Yugoslav and half Greek.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:58.360
He was Greek, that is, he was educated in Greece.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.360
They had the brewery here,

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.360
as you enter the Beaux Street, left.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.360
I don't know if this brewery exists now.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.360
I think they have it.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.360
Not the one that was here, in the corner where there are some photos.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.360
Not this one.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.360
You will go to the beginning of Beaux Street, where the hotel is.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.380
There you will go a little further.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.380
I don't know if this brewery still exists.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:33.380
But this was owned by a Yugoslav.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:41.380
And the daughter of the Yugoslav took the future shipbroker.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.380
It was not a shipbroker.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.380
It was a shipbroker.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:46.380
Correct.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.380
Ship-chandler.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.400
Yes, it was a ship-chandler.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.400
He took the ship-chandler

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:59.400
and his daughter Mary married the ship-chandler.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.400
And his son Antonis Kalinikos

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.400
was educated in Greece.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:12.400
And he was a priest from 1964 until 1985.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.400
He closed the church.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:21.420
Because until then all the port had fallen.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:28.420
There was once a Greek port-captain.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:37.420
Port-captain, that is, when the Greek ship was sailing in the Carinthia,

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:40.420
they went to the port-captain, the port-captain,

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.440
who was a...

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.440
who was a port-captain?

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.440
I don't remember.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:54.440
There was a office here that was Greek,

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.440
Greek servants who worked for the Greek state.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.440
They would hit the ships, the captains were in charge, I don't know.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:06.440
Yannis Kinios was the port-captain.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.460
He was a slave.

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:14.460
I don't know what he did, but he was also a nun.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.460
You understand?

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.460
They were the ones who left.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.460
Around 1960 they all left.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:26.460
Kalinikos remained, who had the ship-chandler.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:30.460
The then-prisoner died.

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:35.460
He is in the...

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.480
There is a plaque on it.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.480
He was a lawyer, Dimitrios the lawyer.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.480
I don't know if you have heard of him.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.480
He remained...

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.480
He was a prisoner from 1915 until 1964.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.480
Because then, when it was in 1917, when there was a riot

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:56.480
between the Venizelians and the royalists,

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.480
he was in the middle.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.480
There was a riot here.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.480
Yes, there was a riot here.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.500
They took out guns.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.500
It was a lot.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.500
Yes, yes, a big riot.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.500
This was the plaque.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:18.500
When you see this book, you will see Dimitrios the lawyer.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.500
These are also photos.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.500
And you will find a lot of information.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.500
Because there are books, there is a book.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.520
There is a painting.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.520
On the top, there is the Pope.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.520
With the baptisms, the chalices, all these three lines.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.520
This will be very useful if you look at it at some point.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.520
It's not a problem.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.520
There is no problem.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.520
I will show it to you.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.520
Just sit for two or three hours and you will get information.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.520
Thank you very much.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:56.520
Please, if I could do more, I would do it.

00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:01.540
If there is any old photo,

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:05.540
from any exhibition,

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.540
I just want to take a photo of it and scan it.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.540
If you have something, if you know.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.540
I just found a photo.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:20.540
A priest who came here,

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.540
he was a priest and became Archimandriti.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:27.560
But before he became married,

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.560
he had 4-5 daughters.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.560
I don't know if you saw this photo.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.560
It should be on the church's Facebook.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.560
I will try to find it.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.560
Give me the...

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.560
Are you on Facebook?

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.560
I will send you everything through...

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.560
My name is George Amarkas.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.560
Send me this and I will become your friend.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.580
I am Konstantinos.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:57.580
Whatever you send me, I will accept it.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.580
And whatever I find, I will send it to you.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.580
Thank you very much.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.580
Thank you very much.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.580
Thank you very much.

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:10.580
I am glad that there are people who are interested.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.580
How do you say?

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.580
History remains alive.
