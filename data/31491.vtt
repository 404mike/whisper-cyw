00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It worked like this, when you were married,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and you had a boy coming up to Colery status at 13,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
then you were leaving school,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
you would get knowledge of one of the men

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
about the village, went to the Workman's Institute,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
which was just coming into vogue,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
or about the football field,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
you want a boy underground, you want a boy.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Then you go and see that man, ask him,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
could you come to work them underground,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
write who he'd fix up with, the officials of Colery,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
who just signed on, and away to go.
