WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
because I find it trippy even though like I find it easy to put it into words when it comes to family

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.160
but when it comes to other people I'm a complete like I don't know train wreck you know sort of

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.600
so I might be able to string words together find when it comes to my family but I'll get muddled

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.080
when it comes to explaining to other people especially if it's someone I don't know so well

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.960
or if it's like you know I used to find it easy to speak to people like my mum and my family

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.880
whereas when I was in supported housing I used to not speak up to support support people that were

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:42.640
there to help me out you know so a bit of um uh kind of like performance anxiety or feeling a bit shy

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.680
or I think it was just because I knew my family a lot more than I did then yeah as people yeah

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.160
more comfortable with them more comfortable because my family I wouldn't have to worry about how they

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.280
reacted yeah so you know they wouldn't they wouldn't kick off or anything you know yeah

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.000
whereas I wasn't sure about the support people because you know they may have a different take

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:13.920
on it yeah yeah so that's that's about having a really good yeah special relationship with somebody

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.200
but people you know if if they're in a work situation then they have to respond professionally

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.280
don't they because well I was living at one point I was after I'd split away it's Beyonce

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.480
I was living in a communal house um in support it was supported housing but it was communal house

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.640
um so we all had one room that was ours and then the rest downstairs was communal like kitchen

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.400
sort of front lounge and stuff like that uh front hallway you know stuff like that um it's difficult

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.840
to kind of speak to the staff because a lot of the other people would then come in they'd be

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.560
coming back from the day services or something you know they'd be out in an hour and coming back

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.080
in and I'd be careful and just kind of keep an eye on the door and see if anyone walks in

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.880
um it sounds a bit like work that actually where you're trying to maybe have a word with somebody

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.840
yeah and you're having an eye on the door and yeah because I used to hear the door

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.880
and I think like they're coming home now yeah so I used to kind of try and tell the staff in not

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.600
so many words so that you know at least no one else would pick up on the conversation yeah

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.640
so you know it's tricky isn't it yeah you've got like sit to some other people in the same house

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.720
it's like yeah and if you had a private conversation with it with somebody and that

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.920
staff and the traders sort of deal with that sort of thing aren't they really in the way

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.960
yeah they're absolutely deal with it but you've got other people in the house that are kind of

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.720
watching what's going on and they so they've got ears to the walls yeah so nothing to do with the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.360
private is it that's the thing yeah and I'm not going to move out because I have my own flat then
