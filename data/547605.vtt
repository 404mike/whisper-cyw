00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.500
Tadea, Lord, I still hear one,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.500
I hear one, I hear one,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:32.500
Tadea, Lord, I still hear one,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:40.500
I hear one, I hear one,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.500
O God, who live and love me,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:57.500
Seek me through my whole, whole being.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.500
Tadea, the Inland's God in heart,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.500
I see him going with prayer.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.500
Tadea, Lord, I hear how well-bound,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.500
How near and far he came.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.500
O God, who live and love me,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:42.500
How near and far, O God, I breathe.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:02:00.500
Amen, amen, amen.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:08.500
Amen.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.500
O thou that gave the magic calm,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.500
And sunset beauty bright,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.500
O thou that hits the spring adorned,

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.500
And gave it song and light,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:46.500
O wonder, Lord, each day we snore,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:54.500
And love thy beat that passeth o'er.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:14.500
Amen, amen, amen.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:22.500
Amen.
