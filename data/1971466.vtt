00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The tide goes in and out every day, twice.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
They used to say that you couldn't die in Fishguard, you couldn't die in the town.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The tide was going out because then you would go off with the tide.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Bit of a crazy idea, but it was that the tide ruled your life.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Because the boats had to have the tide to go out before the engines were there.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The boats had to use the tide to get out into the stream of the main current where they could get the wind and take them out.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So the tide was very, very important.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And it still is. People still say, you know, well, tide's in this afternoon, which means that the harbour will look pretty.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
There won't be so much mud. It'll be nice to look at.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So, yes, it's...

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The tide is important for Fishguard.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The way of life around the port is always about tide movement.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The ships don't move unless the tide moves.
