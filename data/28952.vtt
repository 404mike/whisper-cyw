00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
Laliston Inn and St David's Church

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.680
The church in the centre of the village is St David's Church.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.240
It's a grade 1 listed building and parts of the church date back to the 13th and 14th

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.240
centuries.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.480
There was known to be a church in Laliston long before the Normans came to Glamorgan

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.120
in 1093, but it is likely to have been built from mud and wood so there are no remains.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.840
The church was rebuilt in stone by 1106 when the Norman Lord of Glamorgan, Robert Fitzhammon,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.200
journeyed from Margand to Tewkesbury passing the chapel of Lalistuna along the way.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.200
The village of Laliston is said to have grown around the church.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.680
The church was destroyed in 1226 when locals attacked and burnt several religious houses

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.440
in the area.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.360
This was in protest against the Normans who had control over the abbeys and churches and

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.700
seized land and property from the local Welsh people.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.360
It was built again, this time with a large fortified tower as a defensive strong point.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.920
At the beginning of the 15th century, Oang Lindoor and his followers overran Glamorgan.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.040
Though he usually respected churches, it's possible that the church tower was used against

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.600
him and that he was forced to retaliate.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.040
The church suffered again.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.760
In the 15th century the church was rebuilt again.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.320
It was said to have been entirely rebuilt from the stones of the ruined St. Carwith

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.820
Church in Llangaewydd, though this is unlikely to be true as a peculiar mixture of stones

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.680
was used in its construction.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.520
Instead, many of the stones from St. Carwith are thought to have been used in the walls

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.700
and houses around Llangaewydd.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.760
A few stones remain in the field, known as Caer Hain Egluys, which translates as the

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.460
old church field.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.760
These are said to mark the position of the vanished church.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.320
Restorations took place in 1871 and in 1958 when urgent repairs were made to the roof.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.320
Half an altar stone was discovered at this time, hidden beneath the arch in St. David's.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.760
It is thought to be from the old church in Llangaewydd and is therefore over 800 years old.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.440
The Tower of St. David's Church has four bells, two of which are pre-Reformation periods, 1535.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.880
The others have inscriptions dating back to 1647 and 1719.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.800
Laliston Inn is situated on Wind Street.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.520
It once consisted of two cottages, one built in 1492 and the other in 1547.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.640
In earlier times it was named Laliston Country Club, due to the licensing laws.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.760
Further information about these quaint old houses and their joining together to make

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.760
Laliston Inn is not available at present.
