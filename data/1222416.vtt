00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
How come you ended up back in South Wales?

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:14.240
Because I married a Cardiffian during the war.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.840
And how did you two meet?

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.200
My mother met him. He was an army officer.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:36.000
And she heard we were living in Bletchley then because of the Blitz.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:48.240
And Iver had men stationed in Bletchley.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:59.680
And my mother heard from another Jewish lady about Iver Burke.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:09.920
And she happened to see this army officer in the library.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.520
And she introduced herself and asked him if he'd like to go for supper on Friday night.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.960
Which he did.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:40.880
And apparently my father had known Iver's parents in Merthyr and Pontefried.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:53.840
And my father recognized him because Iver looked so much like his own father.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.800
And that's how we met.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:19.760
And the third time we were together, the third time Iver proposed to me within weeks of meeting me.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.280
Yes, what a wonderful story.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.200
Very romantic story.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.240
Both your grandparents and yours.
