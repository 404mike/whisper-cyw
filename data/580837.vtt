And I think it was surprising to staff the sorts of things that was new to people.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.600
So yeah, going to a supermarket and being able to choose from the whole array of breakfast cereals

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.400
or being able to choose from whole racks of clothes was very new.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.200
I think some of the biggest changes for people were that they could go into the kitchen

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.080
anytime they wanted. They could make drinks when they wanted, how they wanted.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.880
And I do remember that there were two foods that people really, really liked when they moved out.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.880
One of them was cheese on toast and one of them was fried eggs because both of those things were

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.200
really difficult to get in the hospital because meals came ready-made and you can't really make

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.240
cheese on toast an hour earlier. So those were two things that people really enjoyed.
