00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now we have our peace and resistance, Ron and his heart.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'm glad to be here again today. I'm awfully nervous today. I've never been this nervous before to St. David's Day.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Before I noticed that my father's on the program.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'd like to start off by playing a couple of Welsh children's songs.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The first one is Emileur Bach and the next one is Arheidaenus.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We don't play Arheidaenus enough and I think we should...

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If you know the words, you're welcome to sing along with me.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It's a beautiful piece and Arheidaenus is probably the Welsh piece that's most known around the world.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I want to just take a minute to tell you a joke that hurt. Can I tell you a joke?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I thought it was pretty good.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
There was a man who woke up one day and went out to try to start his car and he couldn't start his car.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
He knew that there was a service station about two blocks away.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
He pushed his car all the way to that service station and he saw the attendant there.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The attendant said, well, I'll fix it right up.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The man that pushed his car said, well, I'm just a poor preacher and I can't afford very much.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The attendant said, yeah, I know. I was there at church last Sunday.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:05.000
The next piece I'd like to play is a hymn.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
It's not written by a Welshman, but I would like to tell you the story behind this hymn.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
The hymn is named It Is Well With My Soul.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
It was written by a man named Horatio Spafford and he had a very interesting life.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
He was a wealthy businessman in Chicago and he worked almost 365 days a year.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
This is back in the 1850s.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000
He decided to take a three-month vacation with his wife and his family to sail over to England and look around England.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Prior to their leaving, their son died of an illness, but they still had the plans to go to Europe.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:52.000
His wife and four daughters left ahead as he had other business to take care of and he would meet them in two weeks in Cardiff, Wales.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:02.000
What happened when his wife and his four daughters were going over to Europe, right off the coast of Ireland,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
the ship collided with another ship and the ship sank in 20 minutes.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Horatio Spafford's wife telegrammed back from Cardiff, Wales that the only person saved was his wife and his four daughters had drowned in the accident.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Mr. Spafford left right away and he wrote the words to It Is Well With My Soul in Cardiff, Wales.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
In a way, It Is Well With My Soul is a Welsh song.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
That's why in the first line you have,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
When peace like a river attendeth my way,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
When sorrows like sea billows roll,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Whatever my lot thou hast taught me to say,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
It is well with my soul.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
It's a thought that he came up with those lines at the place that the accident occurred.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
It's really neat how an individual can go through all this tragedy and still say that it's all right with the Lord.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I like hymns a lot.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:03.000
It's said that hymns are about the only art that's given to us from heaven that we as people can take back to heaven with us.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
This is It Is Well With My Soul.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
It is well with my soul.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
It is well with my soul.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
It is well with my soul.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Thank you.
