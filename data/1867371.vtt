00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
OK, it's the 17th of May 2019 and I'm here with Mr Clive Powell at his bike shop in Raider.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.560
I'm Stephanie Cruise of the Ellen Lynx Project.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.840
Clive, have you always lived in Raider?

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.520
No, I haven't always lived in Raider. My family lived here for a few generations,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:29.040
but I spent my youth mostly in South Wales and I came to live around this area in my early twenties.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.120
Right, and when did you take on the bike shop, running the bike shop?

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:42.480
Uh, 1994. I started my bike business in 1985, running guided mountain bike trips,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.920
and I used to keep a few bits and pieces, parts and so on, in a box, and then after a while

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.280
that box became a cupboard, and then finally the cupboard wasn't big enough and I had to open a shop.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.080
Right, and the guided bike trips, were they around this area, up the valley?

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:10.400
Yep, in the Ellen Valley, yeah, all off-road. It was what was the beginning of the mountain bike thing.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.000
Because there used to be motorbike races around here, I understand.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.080
Yeah, that's right, off-road motorcycling is a big sport in this area.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.240
But you started the off-road bicycles.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.080
That's right, yeah, I mean when I used to come riding into town on my mountain bike covered in mud,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.120
people used to look at me in amazement. They were used to seeing motorbikes coming through town with dirt on them,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.160
but to see somebody riding a bicycle with dirt on it, they just couldn't figure it out.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.680
Was it hard in the early days getting the business started? Was there a lot of interest in?

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:55.040
No, I mean it was very much a minority sport in those days, but it quickly expanded,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.840
it snowballed right from the start.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.120
Good, and the building that we're in at the moment is quite fascinating.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.440
Do you know anything about the history of it?

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.640
Yeah, more or less. It started off life as an agricultural building,

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.080
and bits were added to it over a fairly short period of time.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:28.080
And after not very long, I believe, it became a pub, and it was a pub for 400 years until I took it on.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.880
So had it closed down as a pub before you took it on, or was it still?

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.840
It wasn't operating as a pub, it had been operating as a pub up until about six months before I bought it.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:47.440
It was a very, very well-known pub in the area, a very popular pub, so I did make a few enemies to begin with.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.240
Very different trade, really.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.240
Yes, but yeah, fascinating building.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.640
So how have you found running a business in Raider?

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.040
Because obviously over the years there's been economic fluctuations.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.840
Yeah, I mean it's not an accident, but it's a bit of a shock.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.400
Yeah, I mean it's not an affluent area, people don't have a lot of money,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.840
and even though it's a tourism destination, it's fairly small,

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.840
sitting as it is in between the Snowdonia National Park and the Brecon Beacons National Park.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:32.640
Nobody knows this area, and not that many people come, so I'm drawing on quite a small customer base, really.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.040
You get people coming back year after year?

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.840
Yeah, people that know the area, they get to love it and they do tend to come back every year.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.640
And how have you found the electric bike development?

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:55.440
Well, it's taken a while to get going, but it's now sort of developed full steam and it's really taking off.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:03.840
And probably in terms of turnover, we're selling more in e-bikes than any other type of bikes.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.240
Wow, and are they being used locally? Are they used up in the valley?

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.440
Yeah, mostly.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.040
Yes, so what do you think the future holds for your business?

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:23.440
I think a lot of it will be in e-bikes in the immediate future and the long-term future.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:32.240
Are there any more plans for bike races?

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:39.040
As in organising them? I probably won't organise any myself.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:51.440
Bike organisation has become much more formalised and structured and there's less scope for small people like myself to be putting on events.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.640
It's the governing bodies mostly that are taking it on.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.840
Do they come here? Do they use Ellen Valley as one of their venues?

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.640
Not really, they're mostly closed circuits.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.040
Right, thank you very much for that, Nick. That's really, really helpful.
