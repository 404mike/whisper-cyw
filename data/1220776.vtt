00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Can you give us a little bit more detail about what the performances...

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.480
The Hanukkah plays in the reform, what they were about?

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.760
Well I did two of those, Alice and Menorah Land, with many years in between,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.000
and of course the first cast had already grown up, so I had to get the next.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.520
Right. So what was Alice and Menorah Land? How did you go about organising that?

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.880
Well I just auditioned the children.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.200
And then did you write the play or did you write the script?

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.760
No, it was given to me.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.280
Who did that then?

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.400
Well the reform rabbi, he had it.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.800
Was it children or adults?

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.960
No, children.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.320
Just children?

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.760
And were there any stage people helping out as well?

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:59.320
Yes, we had to have eight candles large enough to conceal the children.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.600
So I was going through the halls one day, you know the house of Fraser,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:13.320
and in the window, it was just before Christmas, so I saw these big candles.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.320
So I thought, well I don't lose anything, so I went in, asked to see the display manager,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.560
I said, can I borrow those? And he said yes.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.000
How they were transported, I don't know.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.520
And the next time, many years later, when I produced the play again,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.800
and fortunately the father of one of the children had a shop, a furniture shop,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.600
and he sold linoleum. So we have these big rolls of miloaneum,

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:54.840
and we had orange paper on top for the lit candle, and that concealed the children.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.400
So did the children appear or what happened?

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.800
Well I had to use the candles so that they sort of wove in and out.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.640
Do you know what the third Hanukkah play was about?

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.920
Two of those, and the other one, it started with a boy and girl playing with a chemistry set,

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:23.240
and all of a sudden it explodes. They found themselves in the land of

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:33.240
the Maccabeans and the Greeks, and they told the story of Hanukkah was told.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:40.520
I can't remember what it was about. I know that the leading girl also did a dance,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.200
which I choreographed, and I had eight little girls. Among them was my little girl,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.600
who was what, about six at that time. So I did a little dance for the eight candles as well.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.080
So was this part of a service or was it an extra, or how did it fit into the synagogue's calendar?

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.360
No, this was just part of the celebration of Hanukkah for them.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.000
Did each show go on once, yes?

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.280
Yes. And then the children doing the experiment in the beginning,

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.720
they were at the side of the stage watching all the story, and then they came back into the,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:32.760
with their chemistry set at the end.
