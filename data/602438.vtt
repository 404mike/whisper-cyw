00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
So just tell us your name, start with.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.520
It's Karl Allen.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.680
And you just bought in that Savor Swans t-shirt, how did you get a hold of that then?

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.720
That was one I used to wear when I was a kid.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.880
I don't know why I haven't actually thrown it out, I've kept it for so many years.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.880
Yeah we realised it wouldn't fit you now.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.160
Exactly, I think it was about 10 or 11 when I had that one.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.320
Yeah, and what date was the, when was it actually made, when was that whole campaign?

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.920
I think it was in 1985, I don't really remember too much, I think I said 10 or 11 at that time,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.280
I don't really remember too much about it, but it was certainly in the early dark days.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.080
And that was after the two years of glory?

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.240
Yeah exactly, the highs and then the massive low and the fall.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.640
The fall and the drop when they went.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.040
Yes, so my first games I don't really remember, the first division games too much, too clearly.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.920
I think my first real memory of a football game that I can remember being actually in the North Bank

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.560
was the Paris Saint-Germain game, the cup winners cup.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.520
Oh yeah, I think I won that actually.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.760
I remember being at that game, I know that was my first game, I remember being to games before that,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.000
but that was the first vivid memory I have.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.840
It seemed quite exotic, it seemed like swans are in Europe.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.440
Yeah exactly, certainly not anymore.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.240
Well exactly, it's not to be the Welsh Cup anymore, but there's another way.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.320
But the whole Save Our Swans campaign, were you aware of that at the time as a kid?

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.360
Not really at that age, it wasn't something that I really understood, I knew that the club was in trouble

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.240
and I obviously remember my fans trying to chip in and help out as much as we possibly could,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.200
but at that age it was just a case of just trying to do my bit and wearing t-shirts

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.080
as much as I possibly could to try and show my support.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.880
So you were the mascot, one of the many no doubt.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.280
Because at that time we were talking about this earlier that some grown men didn't wear the

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.520
replica shirts or anything, they were very much just only in children's sizes when they first made

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.880
those replica t-shirts. That's good stuff and it worked.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.000
It did thankfully, the problem is we've been close a couple of times since then as well.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.960
Hopefully that's never going to go there again.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.800
All right then, well that's great, let us know, we've taken a picture of that so we know where it came from.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.120
I found it again a few weeks back and I thought I knew where it was and dug it out of the closet

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.360
and it's not in bad condition given that it's 30 odd years old.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.000
I can't imagine there's too many of them left around at Mord.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.720
No, funnily enough, yeah well just simply because of its age and because it was a kids thing.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.280
Yeah exactly.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.920
People will have, even if it's still Swami's fans, they'll be like, oh I know, I'm a level.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.960
You probably do.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.640
But the good thing is I think...
