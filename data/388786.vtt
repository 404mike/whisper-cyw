WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I was a bit hard.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
He was there.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I thought, go on.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I was trying to tell you, but I...

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
He dropped himself in there.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I've come to make sure you haven't said anything.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Oh, no.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We said it before.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Has he only just come back in?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Yes.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
No, he mentioned your century.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
No.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Harry was very easy to back with.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Because he said yes

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
or no, and that was it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Yeah.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
He ran me out a few times, I think.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I think I ran him out as well.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
On your call, probably.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I think Harry wants him and Jim Turnbull argued in the middle of the wicket.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Is that right?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Because who was to go out?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You and Jim Turnbull.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
You were both in the middle of the wicket and didn't know who was to go out.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I seem to remember once.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Big argument.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Who won?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Oh, Harry.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Jim was too nice. Jim would give it.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Yeah.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We didn't have the depth, though, did we, back then,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
to what modern crickets had here?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
You know, since...

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It could be sometimes sort of four or five out all out.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Yeah.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Obviously, my God, we've had better teams

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
ever since when you were on-point

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
than we had in our playing time.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Oh, yes, definitely, because we played at a higher standard.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You know, like the...

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Rob Kinsey,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
the two Davises, Mark Lloyd,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
the other...

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Jonathan and Joe Davis bowling.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Good players coming in,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
like Andrew coming in at number six

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
in that side.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
That's your son, or John's son?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
No, John's son coming in at number six,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and Gareth coming in at number seven.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
That was a formidable batting side.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And they...

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Yes, that was a very good side, that side.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Not as good now as then.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Oh, no.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The team now is not very good at all.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Is it not?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And yet, they...

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Still enjoyable to watch.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Yeah.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And we're playing at a level where we can manage.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
You're still in the first division, though, of the shop show.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Yes, just about.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Yeah.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
But we're nowhere near the best.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And it's ups and downs.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Not as much depth, then?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
No, well, no.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So when would be the best?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Hardly any good players at all.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
So when would be the best? In the mid-90s?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Which, when we won the league in 98.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Mid-90s, I think.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
When was the one time we won it before?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Ninety...

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
We won it in 98, I know we won it in 98.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
That was the time we played Welsh ball.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
In the final game.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
In the early 90s, then, I don't believe.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It was early 90s, we won it before.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We were consistently good in those days.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Yes, you were never through our bat.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
With good cricketers.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Oh, and Tim Swanson, I didn't mention Tim.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Because he was a good bat.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
But, er...

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
But since there's no cricket in schools now...

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
No, it's a problem.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
That's a problem.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Can I suggest, gentlemen, we just take a break at half point?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I think we're about to run out of tape.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So, we'll have a little break.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Ryan, you want to go fairly soon?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Well, I'm alright with that.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Yeah, I'm difficulty driving in the Japanese IT, I think.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Well, after all the fuck.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Perhaps there's a hard image to live up to,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
knowing that something was going to blow.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
You alright, John?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And the realisation, and the alternative out of it.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Would you think of Ryan?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
What Ryan?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
It's amazing, isn't it?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Did they get to it, did they?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
You never know what they'd be in a place like this.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Well, put it like this.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Ian's ready, Ian's ready.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Right, OK.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So, it starts on a slightly different tack, actually.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Before I get going, can I just check how people are for time?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
No, Brian, you said...

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Well, I'll be alright in a few minutes.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
What time's it now?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
My eyes are terrible, driving in the dark.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
It's gone, my eyes have gone...

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I thought it was half past three, I was hoping to go through till about four.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Yeah, well, it's not dark till half past four,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
so I can get some of the way.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Right.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I just saw the one was coming away from the cricket for a little while.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I wanted to ask a bit about

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
memories of the social side of playing

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and all of that, really.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
What happened after the game?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And the stories?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Well, all I know is that

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Roy Davis had to get up before his dad on a Sunday morning

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
to take the grass from his bumpers.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Because if we would go,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
we'd go to Newtown and we'd go to the back roads

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
to avoid the police.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
There was a breath laser and everything like that.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
But of course, we didn't quite stay on the road all the time.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
But he had to get up

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
to take the grass away from the bumpers on his mini.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Before his dad saw it.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Before his dad saw it.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Otherwise, look at him.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
He was walking his next time.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
We used to have a bus

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
We used to have a bus.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
We're going back to the 50s now.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Not everybody had a car.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
A lot of people didn't have cars.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
We had a bus.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
We'd do a bit of a tour.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Quite often, in the way back,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
in Condova, we used to go to the two pubs in Condova.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
But wherever we were playing in Shropshire,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
the Beacon

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
near the bypassing shoes

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
was one of our favorite places.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Because it had a piano.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Glintanner was a superb singer.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
His brother Ivor ran a band.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And Glint was the singer with the band.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And Glint would have a few weeks to sing all night.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And Glint would have a few weeks to sing all night.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And we used to go to the Beacon quite regularly.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And the clientele used to love us there.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
The...

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Went there one day.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
There was new land out there.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Didn't like it.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Hushed us out.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Went back.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
The next week, thinking we'd try and persuade him,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
he'd sold the piano.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
End of Glint's singing.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
End of Glint's singing there.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
But up at the...

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Is it the Compass in Weston Hill?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Yeah, the first one.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
The Glintanner. People used to stop singing when Glint started.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Did you listen to it?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Lovely tenor voice.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
They were all musical, the Tanners, weren't they?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Arthur, Bernard and particularly Ivor

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
with his band.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Glint had also the longest repertoire

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
of dirty jokes.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
We went to play...

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
We went to play, I think it was...

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Three hours.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
We went to play...

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
The other side of Shoesby somewhere.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And we came back to the pub on the bypass

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
that no longer exists.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
What was it? Where you turned?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
The grapes.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
No, no.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
On the old bypass, where you turned into Shoesby.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
What was the name of it?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Never mind.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
The Oak.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
The Oak, yeah. We went back to the Oak.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And Glintanners told jokes for two and a half hours.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And never rebuked himself.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
No.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Because...

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Amazing character, wasn't he?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I used to say to him,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I'm on earth to remember them.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And he used to say, well, one triggers, one...

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
He couldn't just get going.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
You couldn't say, come on, tell us your jokes.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
It's something that happened.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
He'd start telling jokes.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
We'd had a couple of pints it out as well.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And having only

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
one other person like Glint,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
they'd tell him jokes.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Who was that?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Another person who loved to sing.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Alan Pilden, by Appid Wales.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Another person who used to like to sing them

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
was himself with Bishop.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Do you remember the songs he used to sing?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Yeah, he was a good guy.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
I don't remember the actual songs.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Don't you? He used to sing Sylvester.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
He did too.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
He was horrendous for singing Sylvester.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
But he wasn't a good singer.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
No, he wasn't a good singer at all.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
But he had other songs.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
I can't remember what they were.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
But I remember this Sylvester.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
On the field, he was an easygoing character.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Wasn't he?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
But when he'd had a few drinks...

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Oh, he opened out.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
But apparently he's not well.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
No, he's well...

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Have you been in touch with Selwyn?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Yeah, he's not well, I understand.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
It's hard to travel...

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Because he went to Elan Valley, didn't he?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
He was a date manager at Elan Valley.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
He's thinking he still lives in Radon, isn't he?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Yeah, he probably does.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I remember him missing the simplest catch at...

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
I ever saw he was bowling down here.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
The simplest dolly came back to him

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
off his own bowling.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Everybody was in fits of laughter.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
I remember poor old Selwyn.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
But he could bat.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
He could bat as well when he put his mind to it.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
To put his mind to it.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Yeah, good cricketer.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So would you...

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
I mean, after the games,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
perhaps the Chequers or whatever,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
would that be a bit of a session?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Could be.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
We don't know about any later days.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
When you first started, Brian,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
we used to go to the Brick, didn't we?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Yeah, then it was the Chequers.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Then the Cottage.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Later again it was the Cottage.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
When our boys were little,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
we went to the Cottage.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
The Cottage was a smashing place.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
You were a big drinker, weren't you, at one time?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Fairly big then.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Stopped now.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Robin Olsen was...

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
You know Robin?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
A couple of pints and he'd be...

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Unstopped.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Yeah, Robin and I used to go out together.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Very bit.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
But going back further,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
at the start,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
what we haven't mentioned,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Chris will remember, but John,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
going back to our early days playing in the 50s,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
we sort of straddled an era

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
because there was still one or two from the 30s,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
pre-war players still playing.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Remember Walter Wood?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
No, I don't remember Walter.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Hoesma? No, never played with him.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
No, didn't.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
They used to play in the knockouts.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Oh, in the knockouts, yeah.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
They were played for Montgomery then.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Basel and Basel.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
I played against Fred Holloway in the knockouts.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
The other Harold Davies, Brad they used to call him.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I don't know him.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
I know of him, but I can't remember him playing.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
They used to umpire a little bit still.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Sid Lewis, do you remember?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
I know the name, but I can't remember him playing.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
They were still playing a bit.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Really?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Well, in the knockouts, not so much.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
I mean, Walter Wood apparently,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
he was a master playing with a long outfield

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
because he used to hit every ball in the air,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
drop them between the fielders,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
which is clever.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
I mentioned in the interview,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
but they must have been,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
when I first started practice,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
there were pads that must have been there since the year dot.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Because they were the ones you know you like,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
you see around St. John's with holes down there.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
There were some of those still in the pavilion

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
that must have been there since the first World War time.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Oh, well, there was pads there with only,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
you know, used to do them with straps and buckles.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Well, there was a lot of pads there

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
with only one strap,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
no buckles.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And those wind round gloves.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Cigar like gloves.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
They had no protect, or little spikes on them.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Or a bit of the padding hanging out.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Did you ever find a picture

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
of the whole pavilion after John?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
I've got, I've got

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
two or three

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
really of just

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
teams sitting in front of the pavilion,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
but only being able to see

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
one window in it, Brian.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Because I had one of the whole thing

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and I sent it high and low.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
I couldn't find it.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Well, you've got another fortnight, three weeks,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
and you've still got to find it, me.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
It's got time to go in the new book, but

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
otherwise...

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Because there used to be a store shed out the back,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
which is like an ice cream...

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Oh, yeah, pulled it up.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
It's a bit dodgy in the floor.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
It was a thing off a lorry.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
That's right.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
A canopy off a lorry.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Behind the pavilion in the wood?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Yes.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
No, immediately behind the pavilion.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Yes, but the pavilion was in the wood.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Yeah, you've got the pavilion.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Was it in the wood?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Yes.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Two foot behind that pavilion

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
was this smallish

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
container, which had a

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
pull-up roller

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
that used to keep the moor in there.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Well, you used to go down on a Sunday morning, didn't you?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Yeah.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And there were

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
terrible toilets at the back as well.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Bottle of trains digging the holes for them.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
The one for the ladies was a diabolical thing

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
and the one for the men was even worse.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Metals.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
The text sheet, was it? Corrugation?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Wouldn't do today.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Health and safety would be better.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Today, they shut us down.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Gradually,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
we didn't have as many people, got more cars.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Everybody travelled in cars.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
I grew

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
a tradition

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
with me that I

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
took my car.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Ed Williams and Graham Tuffin

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
travelled with me.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And as my boys

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
grew up, they learnt to drive

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
on the farm tractor or the farm van.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
They never drove the car.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
But on a Saturday,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
one of them was playing,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
he was allowed to drive the car

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
because he would drive us back.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
We'd never pass the

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Banses Bob.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And we used to tour around Shropshire

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
and I'd never, there was a serious accident

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
on the bypass

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
one day.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Three Montgomery cricketers absolutely

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
disgraced themselves by getting out of the car

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and going into somebody's garden and

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
relieving themselves.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And when we came back, they had gone.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
He was about a hundred yards down the road

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
because we had to run.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
You can't name a machine, can you?

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
During that time, we played at Harcourt

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
once and stuck at

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Puppet Shawbury on the way back,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
because it was near Shawbury, wasn't it?

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
And I was with Roger, your brother,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
and everybody went and left us there.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Yeah, I remember your brother.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
I got home, I had to come back

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
to fetch you.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
You were standing on the side of the road.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
You got a lift into Shrewsbury.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
I ran, I came back

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
to Shrewsbury to fetch you.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
No, you went on the bus to Shrewsbury, did you?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
You came all the way back from home.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Yeah, we left Roger and me there.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
We got a bus into Shrewsbury

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
from Shawbury.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And then you had to come and fetch

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
some shrewsbury from Ardell or something.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Yeah, that's right.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Why were you there? You weren't chasing women or

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
something? No, no, nothing like that.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
They were big mates, him and all.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Well, he was my best man.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
The other, like

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
nearer now, I had one horrendous

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
incident. We went to play

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
in Rosely.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And it was

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
let me think.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Neil Tuffing travel with me anyway.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
I don't know how many years ago, 20 years.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Twenty-four.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
We came, it was rained off.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Just before tea.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
So we had our tea in Rosely and went straight in the park.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Stopped there, we came back.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Stopped in Shrewsbury.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Stopped in the Cocker Brockton.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Got back and

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
ran into Jackson. But we also had some

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
I was eloquent, he was doing, he did

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
some refreshments for us, I think. So we had some

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
refreshments, which actually saved my bacon

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
because when Don

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
rode on the

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
corner before

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
and Donning, I went with

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
him.
