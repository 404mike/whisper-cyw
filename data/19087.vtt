00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
Dozens of butcher shops and grocer shops, draper shops, shoe shops, they're all there.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.400
But today very few. Very few.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:21.400
Lipton's is there today, when in those days you had Lipton's then, Meridaire, Maple, Homo Colonial, Thomas & Evans, the Co-op, the New Market Stores.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.600
All went on a bandy.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.600
Soon the Depression came in, all the shops are closed.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.600
So now, where there was about a dozen or more, there were two.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.600
All things have changed.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.600
Dyrdach Vale was a busy centre in those days, Blanclidrach, quite a number of shops there in those days.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.600
Well there's many shops in Blanclidrach at that time, but it's in Tannabandy today I think.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.600
Well, it was in the Gold Bank Blanclidrach in the old days.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.600
Of course the Collies were working there, Camlian was working, Blanclidrach was working, Fullswing.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.600
Also the days.
