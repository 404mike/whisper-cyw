00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.920
I'm Chandrika Joshi and I am in Ilford today and I've come to see a wonderful lady by the name of

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.920
Indu Benpavari and it's 28th of March 2024.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:32.920
I was 4 years old when my brother Ramji Kanji Rajani got engaged to Gurdandas Irji Murjar and his daughter Shanta Bhabhi.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.920
I remember all of this.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.920
So, was your son-in-law born?

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:17.920
I was 7 years old when my brother Ramji got married to my father.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.920
My father was in Africa and my father told me to get busy and I said I won't.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.920
He said, you'll ruin your daughter's life.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.920
So, I was 7 years old when I went to India and my father got married.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:45.920
So, my father came back to India and my father got married to my other son.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.920
Everything was fine and my father came to Tana.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.920
He came to Tana and I didn't know why he came to Tana because it was cold.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.920
He didn't eat anything.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:18.920
He didn't eat anything.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.920
And the weather was cold.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.920
I asked him, if he could come to my house,

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.920
I asked him if he could come to my house,

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.920
he said yes, I can come.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.920
So I went to see him,

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.920
I went to see him,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.920
the uncle of Santababi,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.920
I went to see him,

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.920
he said, brother, brother,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.920
I have come to your house,

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.920
my father has sent me to Kulsa,

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.920
then he said,

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.920
take me out,

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.920
take me out,

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.920
then

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.920
drink water,

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.920
then he went to the bathroom,

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.920
he was drunk,

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.920
he was drunk,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.920
he was drunk,

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.920
he took water,

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.920
he took water,

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.920
he took water,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.920
I don't know if it was five or ten

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.920
or something like that,

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.920
he was the son of his own brother.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.920
He was your new father?

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.920
Yes, my new son.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.920
So your father was there in India?

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.920
My father?

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.920
Yes, they used to live in India.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.920
You mean your father was in India?

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.920
Yes.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.920
My father was a soldier,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.920
my father was the son of Masur's aunt,

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.920
right?

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.920
Yes.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.920
My sister Masur's?

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.920
Yes.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.920
He was in the village,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.920
my father was a soldier.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.920
Was your father in the village?

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.920
You didn't know?

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.920
No, no, I didn't know,

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.920
but he was from your village.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.920
From Kamina?

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.920
Yes, he was from Kamina.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.920
Masur's brother was in the village.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.920
He was here.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.920
Then,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.920
when he was in Kamina,

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.920
my father was

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.920
what was his name?

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.920
My brother was a soldier.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.920
Yes.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.920
Then,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.920
my brother

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.920
came to my brother's house,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.920
and my mother was

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.920
a soldier.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.920
My mother was a very good teacher,

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.920
and she was very good at her studies.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.920
So, she was a soldier.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.920
My father

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.920
was a tailor,

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.920
he had

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.920
two years of experience

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.920
and he didn't have any children.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.920
Then, my father came to Africa

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.920
and he was a soldier.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.920
Then,

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.920
my mother was a soldier.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.920
I told him

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.920
that my father was a liar.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.920
He was

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.920
a black

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.920
soldier.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.920
He was a black

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.920
soldier.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.920
He was a drama

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.920
with other women.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.920
He told me all the lies.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.920
What lies?

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.920
He was a

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.920
very good soldier.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.920
Yes.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.920
My father said,

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.920
I will not marry anyone.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.920
My mother said,

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.920
I will kill you.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.920
I said,

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.920
I will not marry anyone.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.920
I will marry someone

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.920
who will marry me.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.920
Then, my father

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.920
my brother

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.920
my father was married

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.920
my brother

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.920
was married.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.920
They married

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.920
and they took my brother

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.920
in Africa.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.920
In Kabirah Maido.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.920
Did you go to school

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.920
in Kabirah Maido?

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.920
Yes, not in Kabirah Maido.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.920
After that, we went to Sarothi.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.920
Yes, we went to Sarothi.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.920
Oh, you went to Sarothi.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.920
Yes, we went to Sarothi.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.920
My father was a

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.920
very good man.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.920
How much did you learn?

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.920
Just a little?

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.920
No, I didn't learn it completely.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.920
I had met him.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.920
I thought he was a good man.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.920
But he didn't meet me.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.920
He didn't meet you?

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.920
Yes, he didn't meet me.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.920
How old were you when you got married?

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.920
I was 70 years old.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.920
Okay, you got married then.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.920
Did you see each other or not?

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.920
I saw.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.920
You went to India?

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.920
I went to India.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.920
I was in Manabha.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.920
I saw the papers.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.920
His name was Indu.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.920
He called me Indu Raja.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.920
He was working in a company.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.920
His name was Prabhudas.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.920
He was a charter accountant.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.920
I came there.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.920
He was married to Indu Raja.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.920
I saw the papers.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.920
I went to India.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.920
I went to India.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.920
I went to India.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.920
I got it from my dad.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.920
It went to my younger brother.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.920
It went to my younger brother.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.920
My younger brother's father got married.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.920
My younger brother got married.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.920
They went to India.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.920
They went to India.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.920
They went to India.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.920
Oh, God, right.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.920
They wanted to go there.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.920
My father asked about it.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.920
They went to India.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:05.920
I was sitting there and I heard my mother speaking to my younger brother.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.920
She said, now he is there, so come quickly.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.920
I was not aware of it.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:18.920
My mother was a woman of the village.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:24.920
Her wife was my sister-in-law.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.920
She had a son.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.920
So I went to visit her.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.920
I was there.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.920
I was there.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.920
I was there.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.920
My father saw me.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.920
He saw me.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.920
He said, you are doing fine.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.920
I said, yes.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.920
I was there.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.920
He said, yes.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.920
My mother was there.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.920
I was there.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.920
He was there.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.920
I was there.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.920
He said, go.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.920
He was there.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.920
How could I leave you alone?

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.920
Oh God, right.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.920
So he saw you.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.920
He saw me.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.920
He was there.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:14.920
My father's uncle, Sundarji, my uncle was there.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.920
He was there.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.920
You were there.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.920
You were there.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.920
Sundarji was there.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.920
I was there.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.920
He saw me.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.920
He saw me.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.920
He was wearing a saree.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.920
He was wearing a saree.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.920
I went there.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.920
I took orange juice.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.920
I drank it.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.920
Then he said,

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.920
let's have an injection.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.920
I was there.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.920
My uncle was there.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.920
He said, you are very handsome.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.920
He said, yes.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.920
I was there.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.920
He said, no.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.920
He kept on saying no.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.920
Then,

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.920
Lakshmi said,

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.920
I don't know anything.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.920

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.320
I did it myself.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.320
How did you get married to your daughter?

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.320
I married her in Ronda Valley.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.320
I married her in Adif.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.320
I made the kitchen.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.320
Oh really?

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.320
You already liked the kitchen.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.320
Yes.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.320
My father had a lot of money.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.320
My father had a lot of money.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.320
My father had a lot of money.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.320
He used to sell?

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.320
He used to sell the shoulder.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.320
He used to sell the shoulder.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.320
I lost my father.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.320
He killed my grandmother.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.320
He was a good man.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.320
He killed my grandmother.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.320
He took everything.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.320
He took everything.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.320
Poor thing.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.320
Did he get sad?

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.320
Yes.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.320
Then he took my grandmother's body.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.320
Then I remembered.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.320
Your poor thing got sad.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.320
He took everything from his house.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.320
Then I lost my father.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.320
Then I lost my father.

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.320
Oh, you lost your father.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.320
Now you...

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:22.320
You used to live in a rented place.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:26.320
Then your wife and husband got job.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.320
So you started cooking.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.320
Yes.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.320
One day you told me

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.320
that you were going to cook in a wedding.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.320
So I asked you,

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.320
do you want to do this business?

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.320
Who was that?

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.320
Marjeth's daughter.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.320
Nithi, right?

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.320
Yes.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.320
She was married.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.320
I didn't have a car.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.320
So I told her,

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.320
if you want to come to Marjeth's house,

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.320
you can go.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.320
She took Manju's daughter.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.320
She took Manju's daughter.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.320
I knew that she was going to come.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.320
I told her,

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.320
you can go.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.320
She took money and went to sell the car.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.320
Me and my brother.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.320
Sonal and Suri.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.320
Sonal and Suri.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.320
I was here.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.320
Did you go to Penigrahi?

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.320
Yes, I went to Penigrahi.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.320
I came here.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.320
You came to London.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.320
I went there.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.320
I had to do everything.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.320
I had to do the kachori.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.320
I had to do the magas.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.320
I used to do kachori at night.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.320
I used to do kachori at night.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.320
I used to get up in the morning.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.320
I used to do kachori.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.320
When I got up,

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.320
I used to tell my brother,

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.320
if someone is there,

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.320
do the kachori.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.320
I used to do all the kachori.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.320
Who gave me this?

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.320
Who gave me this?

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.320
I used to do it.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.320
Then,

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.320
Vanita Lakhani.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.320
Vanita Lakhani.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.320
Who?

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.320
Who was it?

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.320
So,

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.320
Vanita Lakhani.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.320
Vanita Lakhani.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.320
Vanita Lakhani.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.320
Ram Chubsh Das Bhai Lakhani.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.320
He was married to that girl.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.320
He asked her to give it to him.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.320
He asked her to give it to Indu Ben.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.320
He asked her to give it to him.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.320
So, that was your first job.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.320
Yes, my first job.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.320
I was here.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.320
I was here.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.320
I used to work here.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.320
Who used to do it?

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.320
I used to do it.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.320
I used to go to the register

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.320
to learn.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.320
I used to boil milk.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.320
I used to boil milk.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.320
I used to do it.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.320
Oh, gosh.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.320
So, you used to help the children.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.320
Yes, I used to help the children.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.320
Then, I used to learn

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.320
and learn.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.320
Then, I used to learn.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.320
Then, I used to sleep with them.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.320
In the morning, in the afternoon.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.320
Khandwheelation.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.320
Khandwheelation.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.320
By morning, we would do Khandwheelation.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.320
And then I would go to the....

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:18.320
My older brother I had with me.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.320
I did all this with the car.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.320
That is how I got application.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.320
I was in first position to learn.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.320
You started there.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.320
Yes, first position.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.320
Then I wouldn't be able to learn this properly.

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.820
You couldn't be known by name then.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:36.820
Yes, yes.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:37.820
Then we did a lot of things.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:38.820
Yes, yes.

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.820
Then you did a lot of things in your big weddings.

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:42.820
Yes, yes.

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:46.820
Then you did the same thing in the kitchen, or did you do something in the shop?

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:47.820
Then I did the shop.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:48.820
Then you did the shop.

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:49.820
Yes, yes.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:50.820
And you did the shop, then the kitchen was finished.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:51.820
Yes, yes.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.820
And how many years did you run the shop?

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:54.820
I am asking Pradhyamna.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:55.820
I am asking Pradhyamna.

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:56.820
Yes.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:57.820
How long?

00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:58.820
We closed the shop.

00:25:58.820 --> 00:25:59.820
Yes, we closed it.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:00.820
For 40 years.

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:01.820
You ran the shop for 40 years.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:02.820
Yes.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:03.820
We did it from our home.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:09.820
So you trained the boys to know them and do the same thing.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:14.820
And all the boys and all the girls were happy.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:15.820
All were very happy.

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:16.820
Yes.

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:17.820
All of them.
