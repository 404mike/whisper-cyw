Well I don't know about the greatest impact. That eclipse certainly had an impact because

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.200
it just made you aware that there was more to life really than what we were familiar

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.960
with. But I think one of the things that I do remember and probably did have an impact

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:39.680
was when they showed pictures of children starving in Africa. That I think really,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.360
I mean we all knew things happened, but it sort of brought it into your living room.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.120
And when they first televised, unfortunately as time goes on, I don't say become immune

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.280
to it, but I think you have to build up a certain barrier to it. But the first ones

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:05.000
were really quite shocking and I think that did make an impression. So it makes you more

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.520
aware of what's going on in the world.
