Dawn shares her feelings about the importance of physical intimacy to a relationship.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.120
Do you like being single? No.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.120
Why is that?

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:19.600
I'm in a companion relationship with a little bit of an akipanky.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.760
So I was allowed to say that. Of course you say it, say what you like.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:33.120
I like being with an akipanky. But now and again I prefer death.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.000
I wouldn't command it to talk to me.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.120
So you called it akipanky. Is the physical relationship, part of the relationship, important to you?

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.360
Yes. Like sex.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.640
Yeah.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.140
Yeah.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.960
Is it as important as the companion side of it and talking to people and spending time with them?

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.520
A little bit. Yeah.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.760
Yeah, that's fine.
