WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Thank you again for coming in and having the interview today.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So my first question is, and again you decide how much you tell or don't tell,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
can you tell me about your experience of coming to Wales?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Yeah, okay.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I have so far, I have very good experience in Wales.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I feel like Wales is a very nice country and it has a different language, like Welsh language,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
English is just English language, right?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And Welsh is Welsh language and English is, it's so interesting, it's a completely different language, not everyone knows that.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So I love that and I love the flag of it.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I just love Wales country and I feel like Welsh people are very polite.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Even my cousin, they always say that Welsh people are polite, they are nice.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Can you describe a place or a time in your life that is important to you?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Important. First, in my life is my family, my parents.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I lost my dad three, four years ago, now my mum's, my parents, my siblings, they are the most important thing.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And then my friends. So now I have family, of course.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I have friends, I made new friends who makes me feel like, yes, you are an amazing person.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So yeah, these are the six things important for my life.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
That's it, nothing else, no negativity.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
There is no negativity in my life, like there's no way to come in.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I don't let anyone.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So yeah, what was I was going to say?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Yeah, only just positive, happy, kind, courage.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Have courage and be kind.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And this is that, that's my goal to be happy in my life.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So no negativity, there's no space for negativity in my life.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
That's it.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Thank you. That's very positive and uplifting.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Thank you so much.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Is there anything else you want to share or that you feel is important for us to know about you in terms of doing this industry?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
About me?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Yes, I have only one question and answer.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It's quite interesting and funny.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The other day I was asking my friends like, describe yourself in three words.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
They're like, what? On the spot?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
What? That is such an interesting question.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We never get that question.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I said, just come on, just do it.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
We don't have time.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I was just making them like ruffling.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And then they asked me like, okay, come on then.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
You go first because you asked a question first, right?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
You go first.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So I will say, if anyone asks me, describe myself in three words.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:52.000
In three words, I will say, for me, my, I'll say funny, kind, brave.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And that's it.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
That's me.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Funny, kind and brave.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
That's me. Courage.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And my friend said, I'm attentive as well, which is, I can't tell.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I can't tell that unless anyone can tell you.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
So my friend said, you are very attentive as well.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
That was very nice to hear.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I was like, oh, thanks guys.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Yeah. That's actually.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Nice to be positive about ourselves, isn't it?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Yeah.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Those good, good feelings.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I hope you hold.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I think you are as well.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Come on, let me ask you, describe yourself in three words.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Three words.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Yeah.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I think I'll also say funny.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Oh yeah, of course.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I make myself laugh a lot.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Yeah.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Yeah.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I think I'm quite observant.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Nice.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Yeah.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
That's interesting.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And yeah, I'm quite observant.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And yeah, I think caring.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Caring, yeah.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Sometimes too much.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Yeah.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
But you can see there's a strength in being caring or thoughtful.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Yeah.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
We have to hold on to those things.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Yes.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
That we like for ourselves, don't we?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Yes, yes.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
We have to, yeah.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
That's really important.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Yeah.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So is there anything else you want to tell us about the things you enjoy, the things

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
that are important to you?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Is there anything else you want to share?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I think I shared everything.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Yeah.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Yeah, so far.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Great.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So before we finish up, I was thinking about the museum.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
You saw the painting and you told us that great story about the painting.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Was there anything else you wanted to share from the things you saw that day?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Did I see any snake there?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Snakes?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Do they have any snakes?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
I saw snakes.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
If they have, I must be sure.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Yeah.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Saw snakes.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
I'm sure we could find one.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Was there a snake in the room?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Wasn't there a snake in the jar?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Was it you who was scared?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
No, it was my friend.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I was scared.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
In the jar, my friend was very scared.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
It wasn't me.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Yeah.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Yeah, so that snake.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And then I came home and I really was like, oh, I forgot to tell one story.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
It's literally quite a scary story.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I can't forget that.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
So it was one day, me and my cousin.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
I went to my cousin's house for sleepover.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Me and my cousin.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
In the swimming pool, we were having, we were swimming and we had a bed.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
My cousin was like, okay, let's go.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
It was a massive swimming pool, by the way.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So we had a bed.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000
We were like, whoever goes the other side fast, he's, he's, he's win.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Right.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
I was like, okay, let's do it then.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Because we like to take challenge.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
This is me as a family.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
I like to take challenge.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Yeah.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
So, so like, let's go.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
So we went the same time.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Right.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And it was massive swimming pool, isn't it?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
So it's just funny.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
No one can win because we are very tired to just keep swimming and swimming.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
We're very tired.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So same time we were swimming back from the other side.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Same time.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Same time we came back.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
But as I said, no one wins.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
So we, and then we came back and we were like relaxing for a bit.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
We're taking break from, from swimming.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And then I saw, I am, we saw there's a two snake, two snake.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
They were, I don't know what they're fighting or whether they're like loving each other.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
They were, they were hugging.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
They were doing that like, I don't know, embracing or hugging each other.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
That's what I can't, still since then, till now I can't tell whether they're fighting,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
whether they're loving each other.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
I can't, I don't know.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And I saw, I was the first person.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I saw, I was like, ah, snake.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And it was big snake, black.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Both of them are black snake.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And in my country we have so many snakes.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
It's not like UK.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
It's more like I would say Australia.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Because I think, you know, Australia has a couple of, it's many snakes.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
It's like that.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
My country is like that.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
In my country there's many snakes.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
So, and I, we saw and there, it was two big black snakes.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And they were, I don't know what they're doing.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And then I scream and she's like, why are they, why are they?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
So just, just in front of us.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
It was like not, not very near.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
It wasn't near.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
But I can see, it was, you know, I can see it.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I can see it.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Like I will show, see I was shopping and she, and then she was screaming as well.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And then luckily she, they had security.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
They had security and she called him.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Like she was screaming and he came.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And do you know what the, what's the magic thing?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And he was like, where is snake?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Where is snake?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And then he went there and he saw there's no snake, nothing.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
In the center, where are all the snakes gone?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Where are they gone?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
There's two snakes, where are they gone?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Honestly, that's why I'm, I'm, I still, I still think since then, like, why did they, the snakes gone?

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
He said, he said, I didn't see any snake.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And you guys saw, Mia, it's not just me.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
If it's me, okay, maybe I saw wrong.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
It was my bad, right?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
I can make myself, oh, okay.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
It's just maybe I was very tired.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Maybe, that's why I saw.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
No, it was my cousin as well.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
So, and then, yeah, snakes gone then.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And yeah, that still I keep remember, I keep thinking, what the snakes gone?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Either, and then I think like, are they, why are they actually snakes or something else?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Do you know what I mean?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Maybe there's something else and they became snake and then they just vanish.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Yeah, that this exists, that exists.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
So.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
What else would it be?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Can you tell me what else it would be in that?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Do you know Gene?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Did you, did you watch Aladdin movie?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Aladdin, Aladdin.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Did you see, well, Genie, isn't it?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
So this is actually, we are human being, right?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:06.000
There's another, how to say, another planet that we call Gene.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
That's the Genie comes from Gene.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
That's why it is a Genie.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Yes.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Genie, the Aladdin Genie, the Genie comes from Gene.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
In our holy book, it says about Gene.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
So in Day of Judgment, in the, do you know Day of Judgment?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Like in the, we have, we believe we have two lives, here and hereafter.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Which is here, this world is temporary and hereafter is permanent.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
It's not temporary, it's permanent.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
So in the Day of Judgment where everyone will be in front of our God, in front of Allah

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and He will ask every single one of us, why did you hurt people?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Why did you do backbiting?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Why did you hurt people?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Just because of, He will ask.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
That's why as a Muslim, we have to be nice.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
We have to have, there's no excuse.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
We have to be nice with other people.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
We have to make other people comfortable.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Because in the Day of Judgment, Allah will ask us, why did you do that?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Answer me, otherwise I will give you, I will send you to Hellfire.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And in that day, only people, He will ask only people and jinn.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
People and jinn.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Jinn, they are invisible.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
They are not visible, they are invisible.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:34.000
So they have, they made, we made from no sand.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
There's something else.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And the jinn made, I think from fire, He made.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
This is what we believe.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
If you read it, this is very very interesting.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000
If you read about Quran, our holy book, Muslims holy book, you can know everything about jinn.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
So these jinn, that's what I think now.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I was like, maybe it's not a snake because He didn't see.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
We saw them, He didn't see them.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
So if it's not a snake, then it must be jinn.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
The jinn can vanish like anytime.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
If it's like, if we see snakes, if it's actually jinn, he can vanish like,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
he can be like this table.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
So this is what I think.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
It would be jinn.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Which is, jinn comes from jinn.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
That's what He called jinn.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Isn't it so interesting?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Fascinating.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Yes.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Really fascinating.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
I didn't know that.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Yes.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Yeah.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And then the other day I saw interview from, in our back home interview I saw,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
because now it's weather, it's very rain, it's flooded everywhere.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
We didn't get, my house didn't get flooded, luckily.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
But I saw interview like people, journalists, they interviewed people,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
random people and they're saying how they're feeling, how they're surviving now.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
So one lady was saying, when I, she's a farmer, right?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And she was like, when I go to farming, when I go to field, I see many, many big snakes.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And at the end of the time she was saying, this country is full of snakes.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
She was saying, because I know the isora, I used to see when it's heavily raining,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
I used to see snakes in front of our house, even, well, because it's raining,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
it's everywhere's watery, so they're just swimming.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
So they have to live, right?

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
How we live, they have life as well.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
So we're like, okay, you are our friends, new friends, okay, live your life.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Just don't bite us because our country,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
they're better, some of our better scary, they can eat you,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
they can, you know, yeah, bite you and then you can, you will die.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
So they're very scary snakes.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000
That's why sometimes horribly we have to kill them sometimes,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
which is not nice, it's just because of us.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Otherwise, they will kill our family, especially the babies,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
because they don't know the snakes, you know, they don't know the difference.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
They will be like, oh, this is toy, this is my toy.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
But some of we keep them as a pet, like here.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
I think now here in the UK, people keep as a pet snakes, right?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
So yeah, so that lady was saying this country was full of snakes country.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
I find it a bit funny.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And of course, I feel so sad for them because she said,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
whenever I go field to farming, I see this massive snakes.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
I'm very scared.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
So yeah, if you go ever in my country, you will see that.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
It's like Australia.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
That's great. It's a great story. Really interesting.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
I still don't know whether they're loving each other or were they fighting?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
I think they're fighting, but that way, honestly, I wish you can see.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
They're like, do, doing that.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
I think they were fighting, not loving.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Love's not like that, isn't it?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
They were arguing.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Fighting over some food or something.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And we were honestly like snake were there and we just came.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
We just came swimming.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
It's very near.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
We're very near them.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Luckily, they didn't bite us.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Luckily.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Oh, God. Otherwise, I would have been dead.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Right. I would have come to UK.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Oh, brilliant. That's a great story.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Really. Thank you.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
I wish you enjoyed.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Can you tell me, was it very hot?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
It was hot. It was very hot.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
It was like summertime, summer hot time.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
That's why we were doing swimming in swimming pool.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
That's why it was very hot.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Was there anything else you wanted to tell about anything you saw on the day or anything else?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Okay. So when I was little, like baby, baby, baby, yeah, my mom went to my cousin's wedding.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
My aunt, like auntie, that side.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Her sons, it was her sons wedding.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And then she holds me like this and she was walking all around the hall.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
And everyone's like, oh, is this your granddaughter? Is this your granddaughter?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
She was like, no, no, that's my niece. That's my niece.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
My son's getting married today.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
My first, oldest son's getting married today.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
She's not my granddaughter.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
The next day, we came home.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
The next day, all my body was all rash.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And pimple, rash, bruise, all my body.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
I was nonstop crying.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And then because in my country, they say, evil eyes.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Yeah, they said I got evil eyes.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And then I was crying and, you know, because I was like, I was maybe six months or something, little baby.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Yeah. And then my grandma, yeah, she, we have a little bowl.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Like gold color. I don't know what they call in English.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
This gold color, a metal one, pure metal.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
And all the bowl is written, the Quran, the surah, the poem.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
She showered me with this one.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
She make a whole big pot of water.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
And then she soaked that bowl in that water.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And then she showered me.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
And then slowly, slowly, I recovered from the evil eyes in my whole body.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:06.000
And then since then, we believe if you get evil eyes, even my own niece, nephew, if they cry too much,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
still my mom kept that bowl with her.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
It's my grandmoms bowl.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000
My mom still keep it.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
So it's like, and then after my mom, she will give it to my sister-in-law.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
So it's like our, our family thing.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Yeah. This is why we believe if you get evil eye, you can shower with that bowl and you'll get recovered.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Yeah, that's it. That's actually.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Nothing else.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Is there anything else you'd like to add to the interview?

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Anything else you wanted to, you want us to know about you?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
I just want to, only one thing.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
I think I told, I told everything.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
I said everything about me, my childhood, the stories.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:55.000
It's just, I just want to give thank you to you guys, first of all, because through you guys, I can share my childhood story.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
I can share that interesting, my feelings, especially my feelings.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
I can share and I can give like advice that people can hear.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
If anyone here hears me, it's like just is my advice.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
It's do whatever you want.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:18.000
As long as it's not harming anyone, as long as it's not, you know, you know, giving stressing anyone else.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
So as long as it's not like that, just be yourself, do whatever you want.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Be positive, have courage, be kind.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
That's it.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:35.000
And you guys give, I want to give you guys thank you and Bowser, obviously Bowser, through Bowser, I went to that museum, right?

So I just want to give them massive thank you.

It's a great opportunity, great company.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Staffs are, it's amazing.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
All staffs are amazing.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Yeah.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
It's so important we have these places.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Yes.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Yeah.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Right.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
We have to go on.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Otherwise, like our, like our skills.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Absolutely.

Yeah.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
That's it.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
OK.
