00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This is Caroline Hunter interviewing Mark O'Connor at 11.51, no 1.51 on the 17th of April 2018.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Mark has signed the project consent form. This interview is being recorded for Wonderbras 25 project funded by HLF Cymru.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So Mark, what was your first instrument?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
First instrument is drums, as always been.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I started later than I wanted to.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I wanted to play drums from, I don't know, probably around six or maybe even before.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But I got held back.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And then later on, many years later, age 13, I got my drums.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And that's been the constant really. That's been there all the time.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Did you get a drum kit or did you buy them steadily?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I got a kit. I went out. We couldn't afford a drum kit, you know, my mum and dad.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So they said, look, you know, if you can save, then they'll match me.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So I went out and I got a paper round.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And yeah, and I saved up all my money.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And then they matched me and I got my first kit.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And I loved it for a good while. And then I left it for a little while.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
As kids do, they get into things, they get out of things.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And then luckily I wasn't out of it for too long.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I was back into it after sort of a year.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And then yeah, and then it's been a constant ever since really.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So yeah, I think definitely constant from age 14.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Did you learn any other instruments after that? So drums was from about 14.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I did at college at age 16.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:46.000
We had to do keyboard skills as part of the performing arts course I was on at the time.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So I did two years of keyboard skills, which I think was brilliant, most useful.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And also we had to choose an instrument for our second study.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And on that course was a fantastic musician and tutor called Lee Goodall.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So I was, yeah, I felt very lucky to be around him and to be being taught by him.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And I thought, that's going to be my second instrument. I'm going to learn alto saxophone.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And so yeah, that quickly became my second study in college.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
How old were you when you started? That was about 18, was it?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
That was 16.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
16?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Yeah, I went and did a performing arts BTEC national diploma straight after GCSEs.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And yeah, and that was, yeah, that was the sort of really the start of my music education really.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Oh, fantastic. So how did you hear about Wunderbros?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Well, first of all, I guess I used my feet and followed my ears really,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:24.000
because I was in, I can remember playing in Brecon Festival, I think the year was 94 or 95, something like that, around that day.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And I can remember hearing a big sound down on the street and I walked up to it.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And it was, I later found out it was Wunderbros all stood in a formation that I have never really seen Wunderbros adopt ever since.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
It was a big circle from what I can remember.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And I think maybe Jess or Rob in the middle, I can't quite remember which.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Yeah, and that was my first encounter with Wunderbros.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
So it was, yeah, it was like I heard them live first.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Yeah, definitely.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And yeah, and then I didn't follow it up or anything after that.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
But yeah, that was my first encounter with the band.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000
I was out on the street listening to them and I think they were playing Michael Jackson's Thriller.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Oh, were they? That was before my time.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Mine too.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000
When did you choose to join the band or how did that come about?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Well, the year was 97 and it was October.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And so, yeah, it came about by, I can't remember who got in touch.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I have a feeling it might have been Denise.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:23.000
But it came about because Jess, the original drummer in the band, he was relocating to Germany, I think.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
I'm pretty sure it was Germany.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And yeah, the drum chair needed filling.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:38.000
So yeah, they asked me in 97 and I said yes.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And then it's been, yeah, it's been like a regular, a constant in my life ever since really.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Yes, absolutely.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:59.000
How do you think your musical experiences have changed with Wanderbass as part of your life?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Well, I think musical experiences, well, they're all very different.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:20.000
I think there's no, for a number of reasons, there's a lot of variables in Wanderbass.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And I think a big part of that also is no two gigs really are ever the same.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:40.000
So the experiences are always quite different.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:50.000
But I think, so the question was how the musical experiences affected.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Yes, how did the experiences of having Wanderbass as part of your musical life,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
how have those experiences enhanced it, changed it, added to it maybe?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely added to it.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:17.000
You know, like with most Wanderbass encounters, you're always finding things out.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:29.000
You're always mixing with an amazing group of people.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Because it's quite a large group.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Yeah, more often than not, very large.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000
The times when we've been small, so few and far between, you know.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:51.000
So yeah, I think that has shaped me quite a lot, I feel.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Because I guess on one level, being a musician, I guess I find in my life,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
it's very often the case that I meet more musicians.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:21.000
When I go to Wanderbass, I find myself not so much meeting musicians,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
but meeting a much broader cross-section of society.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So, you know, of course I'm intrigued by that.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Yeah.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And I find the people there very interesting.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And I think for me, that's a big part of the charm of Wanderbass.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And it's part of the pull, I think, is that great mix that you get.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Yeah, and I think over the years, I couldn't tell you exactly how I feel it shaped me,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
but I know it has and I know it's in there.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
So can you tell me what experiences in particular stand out for you?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
What particular projects maybe?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Yeah, there's been a lot.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:39.000
I'd say the big ones are, I think the King Django was a big project for me.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:47.000
I felt like the band went through quite a big change in that time.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Also, I think we got close to sort of forging a bit of a new band sound, if you like, I think at that time.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And it was brilliant, always brilliant to have a guest come in and just sort of take us to a new place.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
I think that was really, really, really exciting.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And that's not the only time that that has happened, but I think for me that was definitely a bit of a personal highlight.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:46.000
But amongst many, I think the 10-year birthday celebration or 10-year anniversary was really good.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And I think, I guess, in terms of concerts live playing, there's one memory that goes back a long way.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And I can't remember the year. I could probably find it out somehow.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
I can remember us doing a jamboree at Druidston.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And it was the first one I'd ever played. And we were outside in the marquee.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And I'm not quite sure what was taking place, but basically the band was just really playing up.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And the audience there at the Druidston, the crowd at that jamboree were then meeting the band.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And then that made the band want to play up even more.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And I can just remember that very particular gig was, it was pretty powerful for me.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And just kind of feeling, I was at the first time where I felt some sort of wonder brass fire, where I felt, whoa, you know, that felt,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000
it felt like it was on the verge of out of control in a very good way.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:20.000
That's a standout memory for me. I'm imagining I see the very late 90s or very early 2000s.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And then the other one that I think back to quite a bit is the first time travelling with the band, which was in 1999.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And we went to Cork Festival. And that was the first time for me to be away with wonder brass and also to be away with a big band.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:54.000
I'd been away, you know, travelling with smaller units, smaller bands, but never with that kind of entourage or numbers.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
It was amazing, you know.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:11.000
And yeah, just arriving in a city, there just to play music and have fun with a group of that.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000
So there, that number was amazing really for me.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And that's again a really big memory, you know.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:38.000
There's lots, there's lots. That's definitely two, you know, which I think big live experiences for me, you know, with the playing.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:49.000
You know, whenever you're away in a land and you're in another country and your connection to that country is to play music.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:58.000
That's quite an amazing starting point for being somewhere, you know.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:06.000
So yeah, I think I took that opportunity with both hands really.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Yes. So obviously you feel very much part of the band now.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:20.000
When do you think was the time when you began or how long did it take you to feel sort of, you know, part of the wonder brass family?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Oh.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Is it quite early on? Did it take you a while?

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:30.000
I don't know. That's an interesting one.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:43.000
I think it must have happened quite early on because I can't remember really thinking, oh, I don't feel like I belong.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:51.000
I can't never remember thinking that feeling. So it must have been quite soon.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And, you know, by the same token, I can never remember a point where I've gone. It's now, you know, I'm in.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:09.000
I think I felt quite in from the beginning really.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:19.000
I can remember other things about joining the band which weren't quite so immediate stuff.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:29.000
You know, like the enormous repertoire that there was to learn and, you know, I think even that there is now.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.000
You know, for anyone who's to come and join now would have probably the exact same feeling.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:47.000
You know, I can remember, you know, much like just like now, we would meet every Tuesday and you would learn and learn and learn songs.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:17:04.000
And then, you know, four or five months later, you're still learning more songs and you just, you know, maybe I was too preoccupied with that to think, crumbs, am I in the band yet?

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:21.000
I was, yeah, I was always knocked over at how just how long it took to really to feel like I was, yeah, I was on top of the repertoire, you know.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
That felt like it took a year, if not more.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:42.000
So what particularly are you looking forward to in the coming months and years through this project or where do you see further projects going?

00:17:42.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Well, I guess with this project, I think it's, for me, part of the excitement is kind of, you know, looking back, kind of marking the distance and going, you know, because it's, I've been nearly 21 years in the band.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:24.000
And so, you know, when I think back as much as I think of it in musical terms, also a lot of it is, you know, on very much social terms as well, you know.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:53.000
So I think for this project, a lot of it will be the chat, really, seeing old friends and, yeah, you know, just having good chat and catching up and then hopefully, you know, playing some music and

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:07.000
and, yeah, sort of reliving the good times and making new times as well, you know, because the band changes so much, you know.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:27.000
I'd say nearly, you know, obviously we've spoken about gigs change all the time, setups and, you know, variables, but year on year, it feels like the band changes shape in some form, you know.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:56.000
So, yeah, I think catching up, seeing some friends, some old friends and also, I guess the other thing with this is the music, you know, some new songs and, you know, yeah, just getting on the sort of celebratory level of, you know,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.000
everyone coming to play some new music and some old tunes as well.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:11.000
And I think, yeah, I think that's my excitement for this project.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Oh, fantastic. Is there anything else that you want to add?

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Well, I suppose, I mean, I'd love to say a massive thank you to Wunderbrass really for an incredible 20 years and, you know, there's no other situation like it and there's no other feeling like it.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
There's no other feeling like it either, really.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Yeah, so thanks for that really. I've loved it.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Thank you, Mark.
