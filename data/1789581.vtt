WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And just check it's going. So I have to start saying I'm Marsha Mani and I'm here today at

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Robertson. Robertson. Robert son. Pan Robert son and it is Thursday the 20th. 21st. Thursday the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.880
21st of March 2019. Thank you, Pam. Robert son. 35th anniversary of my father dying. Yes. Oh really?

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.280
I'm just going to pop that there, Pam. Right. No, it's really helpful because this is going to

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.240
become an archive. Really helps if you could just give me your date of birth as well. So Pam,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.120
can you tell me where are you born? In Cardiff. Yeah. Near Victoria Park. Yep. And I lived there

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:06.000
till my husband, well I went to Aberyst University for three years and then we got married and then

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:18.160
we lived in, I put the farm, flat-owned farm in Pennyland, not in Cardiff but Pennyland Baselake.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:27.200
So you went to university you said? Yeah. Oh that was, so you were what in the 50s? 56. So was that

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.640
was that quite unusual then? I don't think so, no. No? What did you do at university? Agricultural

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:44.000
science followed by a postgraduate diploma in dairying. Okay. And it was in the dairy industry

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.920
then that I spent my working life. What were you doing? I was head of the laboratory. We had a big

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.760
milk processing plant here. I didn't know whether you knew that but um, no. Just you go to the end

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.240
of this lane turn right and there are new houses on your right. Yeah. And that's where the dairy

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.560
was, yes. And I was in charge of the laboratory. So was that the National Milk Marketing Board?

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.760
No, no, no, no. That was United Dairies. Okay. And then my claim to fame, if I have one,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.400
is that I made the first yogurt to be sold commercially in South Wales. You did? Yeah.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.040
Because I went up to the head laboratory in London when they were experimenting with this stuff that

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.560
had come, actually from Bulgaria it came and I thought it was horrible. Well I still think

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:44.160
it's horrible. I never touch yogurt now. And we made yogurt and then I came back to Marshfield and

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.400
we produced it there. And initially it was sold in Swansea, the first lot we made. The first lot

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.920
we made was 500 little of those third pint pots with a wide rim. And when I left there they were

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:07.600
doing 1500 a day. So yeah, that was where the yogurt came from originally. Here in Marshfields,

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:17.360
what year was this? 1961. That's incredible. And this was with, is it United Dairies?

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.200
Canberra and United Dairies that was, yes. Which is one of the outlets for United Dairies which

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.200
was the biggest then, the biggest company, milk company in the country. Yeah. So did you get a

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:37.680
claim at the time for doing that? No, just did as I was told. Oh we had some fun with that yogurt.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.680
Anyway. What do you mean you had some fun with it? Because Muggins decided that if we could make

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:54.240
plain yogurt we could make strawberry yogurt. So I got strawberry syrup in and that was brown,

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.360
a horrible shade of brown. I used to call it calf shit brown.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.400
And we got in lactose and we replaced the normal sugar with the lactose and this strawberry syrup

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:15.120
and it was horrible pale brown liquid. So I went to Tesco's which was in High Street in Newport

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.200
then and I bought up all the cochineal they had. And instead of adding it a drop at the time I

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.480
chucked the lot in and suddenly the colour of those candles was turned out like gold.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.160
Chucking down the drain having got one of my staff to watch that the dairy man who didn't see me.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.320
Start all over again, go to Tesco's for more cochineal but I'd already bought it all so they

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.320
didn't have it. Up to Aster, got that cochineal and then I did add it a drop at the time till I

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:51.600
got the right colour. We had some fun with that yogurt. Oh dear, dear, dear. It was heated

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:00.880
in a big vat. It was a double lined big vat with hot water running in between the layers to heat it

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:08.800
up. And I turned on the steam one day to heat it up, went to do something, forgot all about it

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.920
and when I came back there's all this yogurt all bubbling in. Chuck that away and start again.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.400
The things we did with that yogurt was hilarious. So when it was launched, do you remember when it

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:28.560
was launched? That would have been it in 1961. It went first to Swansea and then I don't know when

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.680
the supermarkets picked it up because in those days it was either plain yogurt which was quite

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:42.400
a clean taste but sharp. And then of course the yogurt that they make now doesn't bear any

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:50.800
relation to that at all. And I've never eaten the stuff since because I've had such a time

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:57.360
tasting every flipping batch that I don't want yogurt anymore. Never have yogurt. The only time

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:04.560
I have it is if I'm actually giving it as a sweet. In fact I went to my friend and she had Tesco's

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:11.600
finest raspberry yogurt and it was gorgeous. And I've looked since and I can't find it in Tesco's

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:18.720
anywhere so I've given up on that. I think I can live without yogurt. That's quite something though

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:25.520
actually I think that you were the first, you created the first yogurt in Wales. South Wales.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.920
Yeah I don't know about North Wales. In Marshfields. Yeah. So was it a big unit,

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:38.560
was a big factory here? Oh massive, yeah a really massive milk factory. Yeah. Mainly bottled milk

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:44.960
and we used to send 30,000 gallons a day to London in milk tankers you know from the railway.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.600
We had a little tanker that went back and forward filling these big tankers for the railway.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:55.600
What from Newport? It would go from Newport? From Marshfield the siding was here. Yeah. And then it

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:01.840
just got hooked up to a goods train or something and ended up in London. Oh my goodness. So where

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:09.840
did all the milk come? Where did it start off? Nowadays they collect milk in big tankers

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:16.400
but in those days they were in churns and it was pretty well the whole of Monmouthshire and part

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:26.400
of Glamorgan. How many farmers would it have been? Around about between 50 and 60 farmers

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:34.080
and the milk used to come in in churns and that was it. And then it went into the

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:42.160
bin it was pasteurised and bottled. Gosh. So how many people were working there? Oh crumbs I don't know.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.400
I don't know. I had seven in the laboratory, three on the out.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:58.560
Probably between 50 and 60. Yeah it would have been that's just a rough estimate because I've

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:07.680
really never thought about how many were there. Yeah. So when did it close? Right.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:19.680
Oh it's certainly more than 10 years ago. I don't know. Let's just say within the last three years

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:25.600
within the last 20 years that sort of time and then they built all the big houses. So that would

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:31.680
have been lots of dairy farmers. All their milk would have gone there and it would have been

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:37.520
processed there and then either gone into milk bottles. That's it. Sent to London or made into

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:47.040
products. The milk was sent in tankers to London but it went into bottles and the company had

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:52.720
depots or you know where the driver would take all the bottled milk and from there it went to the

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:59.920
milkman who in those days delivered it which they don't anymore. Yeah that's just an example

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:06.160
of something that's gone. Yeah oh yes. Yeah you're right nobody well very few people I think get milk

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:11.840
delivered. Yeah I do actually. Do you? Yeah I insist on supporting at the end of my road there

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:18.000
is a dairy. Ah right. And I want to support it. Fair enough yeah. Like I can you know. Oh yes. So what sort of place was it

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:27.520
like to work in? I enjoyed it. It was fine yeah. I was my own boss. I had to add all the power in the

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.560
world. If I didn't like what was happening I could just stop it all stop the bottling dead and

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:43.200
get to the cause of whatever was you know was happening. We had a chap who was a troubleshooter

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:52.880
and we had a woman rang up to say that there was half a mouse in a bottle of milk.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:01.200
So if that had got into the papers so we sent this chap along and we sent him with a massive

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:08.160
crate of tin peaches and tin this and tin that and tin the other to take this lady and his

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:13.360
instruction was that even if he had to kill her he had to bring that bottle back with the mountain

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.720
because we didn't want her calling the public out. It was a good thing she did call us first. Yeah.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:25.120
And anyway he did get the bottle out. There's the back half of this mouse with a long oh god

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:32.640
it was disgusting. What had happened was it must have been in the bottle before it was washed

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.560
and the washing didn't get it out of the bottle and then it got filled up with milk and that's

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:43.760
what happened. Poor woman what a thing to find. I don't think I'd have been very happy. No. So

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:51.360
you would get hundreds of bottles thousands of bottles in every day. Yeah. So it was your job to

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:57.360
make sure everything was sterile and that's it and the chemical composition was right

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:05.040
and the bacterial composition was right. Yes. Yeah. We started at five in the morning and

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:12.800
went right through till about 10 at night in shifts. Yeah. Well the thing is I'm thinking

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:20.960
from my perspective that's quite a responsible position for a woman in the early 60s.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:28.880
Yeah it was. Yes. Were you a bit of a trailblazer? Oh yeah. I never thought of myself as a trailblazer

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:37.360
but yeah we had one man in our office. He was a student and he was in fact the son of one of

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:45.200
the princes in one of the minor African countries and he was a student here and we were short of

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:53.760
staff. Two of us had left on maternity leave and the man said the only one I can offer you that's

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:59.520
got a reasonable brain is, can't even remember his name, but anyway this chap he was wonderful. He

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:04.640
was really really lovely. Really? And in the end nobody was bothering so you used a pipette after

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:10.080
him or anything. He was just a really nice bloke. You don't remember what country he was from? No

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:15.840
it was a minor African country and I yeah but um I can't remember. I would have known at the time

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:20.960
but I can't remember it now. Oh. Yep. So were you living in Marshfields when you were working?

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.360
No I was living in Wychurch and I had a Vespa scooter and I used to get back and

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:33.440
forward on that. Did you? I had a car first. Yeah. No hang on which did I have? I had the Vespa

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:38.960
scooter first then the car yes. A big old Austin Devon. How far is Wychurch from here?

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:46.880
Outskirts of Cardiff. Um six eight miles I suppose.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:56.160
That's a lovely cup of tea thank you. Oh good. So were you married then when you were working?

00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:01.760
I married in 1958 so it was in the middle of the yeah. So what did your husband think about you

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:08.160
working there? Oh he didn't worry. Didn't he? No. He had his tractor in his head cutter and he used

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.200
to go around oh first of all he used to start at five in the morning and drive a milk lorry just

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:18.000
for one delivery and then he'd finish about ten and then get on his tractor and cut hedges and

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:29.200
ploughed fields and all the rest of it. Really? So how long were you here for? Um 19 married in 63.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:38.560
We lived then in a house um it's on the same level as this but towards the main road. Yeah.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:46.160
To Nunant and we moved there from then 81 um up to the farm and then moved down here eight years ago.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:53.680
Okay so um so you and your husband you spent some of your married life here in this area?

00:13:53.840 --> 00:14:00.080
Yes we did yes quite a lot of it actually all our kids were born there yeah. Oh really? So what

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.320
in Marshfields? Not Marshfield, Coyde-Curnew which is the next village along. I must have

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:10.720
passed through that yeah. Yeah. How do you pronounce it again Pam? Coyde-Curnew. Coyde-Curnew.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:21.920
Curnews wood so whoever is it whoever Curnew was. As you as you came from Newport I presume along

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:28.320
the 848 yeah um you probably wouldn't notice but just before you get to Castleton um there's a car

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:34.240
car place on your left hand side selling cars. Yeah. That then was the garage where I worked.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:41.360
Really? Yeah. After the dairy? Yeah. So you were at the dairy so that must have been quite a big

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:48.240
employer for the area was it? Yes but then I had my children so um and then by then we had um

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:57.520
we had 14 JCBs then my we kept adding JCBs um to do the work so I then was sort of full time

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:04.480
in the office and with the kids. Okay. Doing the invoicing and whatnot. And that was at Coyde-Curnew?

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:11.200
Yeah that was yes. So what was it I mean imagine the place has been developed massively over the

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.480
last 20 30 years what was it like when you you first married and your children were young?

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.040
It's not much has happened in Newport where it's Cardiff that's done the expansion

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:28.000
and Newport's pretty well stayed the same but Cardiff have come right to the boundaries of

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.800
them between them and Newport. Yeah. And every time you go out there's more houses being built

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:39.120
there are a lot from you know now toward it all used to be green fields going to Cardiff but now

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:45.280
of course it's all houses. It's all been developed? Yeah. So when your children were young did you have

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:52.000
places to play in the fields and? Well this was it we we had um we lived right at the end of a lane

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.880
that only ended in our house so the kids could run wild in the fields which they did. Yeah. Yeah.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:06.000
And then they they rigged up a swing with just a bar of wood that they sat on and from one of our

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:13.200
trees and they they made their own fun they were and um they will all say now that they they had a

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:20.000
marvelous childhood because they were so free when they went to school I had to teach them road sense

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.360
because they'd never had it because we get in a car in you know it's at the house and drive somewhere

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:31.360
and they I had to teach them you know look right look left look right again and then walk across

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:37.040
the road. Really? Because they didn't and my daughter nearly got killed oh boy I went to meet

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.600
her from school and I was coming down the road and the school's the other side of the road she

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:48.000
was on the pavement she saw my van and she just shot out right in front of this woman in a in a

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:55.360
modest minor and she jammed on the base and she actually did touch Dawn but that was Dawn's fault

00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:01.840
because Dawn sort of staggered and I thought she's going to be killed because I could see

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:08.240
this car coming up but uh awful thing but she survived. Oh my goodness. Yeah. Did you have

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:14.880
reams on your land then? Reams? Reams? You know were the water channels?

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:24.560
Yeah. The ditches yeah yeah. Did you have to maintain those? Uh no no we didn't we had to um

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:31.440
we had a stream that ran past our house but it was um so really no the reams were down here and

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:38.320
the stream ran into it yes no we didn't have to do any of that. So your husband had um or you both

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:44.400
had a JCB business? Yeah. Did you? Yeah. So and you've built that up over several years? Yes and the

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:51.040
last big job we worked on was the Bute Town tunnels in Cardiff we had six JCBs on that right from the

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:57.680
time it started till the time it finished. So when would that have been Pam? Oh hang on let me think

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:11.040
let me think the 1990s Martin died in 98 it was before that in the 1980s I suppose and the start

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:17.840
of the 1990s yeah yeah yeah. That would have kept him busy for some time. Oh yeah yeah it was it was

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:24.240
a long job that one yes yeah yeah there were six JCBs on that all the time yeah. So he did work

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:31.600
he must have done work on other developments in oh yeah yeah all over the place yes yeah. So what

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:37.360
sort of stories did he have or did he come back and tell you you're telling me nothing really about

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:44.400
the boat? Oh that one when he went through the boat uh yeah that was before the JCBs either when we

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:50.720
were I think we were married then we're only just and he worked for a drainage board and I don't know

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:56.720
whether you know the Six Bells pub in Peterson yeah and he passed there where the Rheene was

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:05.840
he dug through and it was like a canoe um and he dug right through it and the archaeologist came he

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:12.000
told his boss near archaeologists came out and had a look and decided it was very very old and they

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.400
wanted to get it right out but the owner of the farm wouldn't let them dig it out so I presume

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:26.000
it's still there. Wow! Yeah so yeah but how old it was they really didn't know but it was very

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.080
very old yeah gosh it must have been really to be you know when it was yes yeah so your husband

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:37.120
worked for the drainage board yeah before we before we started out on our own yeah yeah so what sort

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:43.840
of jobs was he doing then? Oh he had a big excavator um and virtually just cleaning out the

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:51.760
all the between Cardiff and Newport and Newport and Chefstow and just cleaning out the the ditches

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:58.800
so the Rheene's. So this would have been what the late 50s? Yes that would have been yeah. So there

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:06.000
would have been quite basic machines then? Oh yeah yeah he rode a motorbike to work and his

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:14.480
his excavator it wasn't his it was what he worked for um that was parked the other side of Newport

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:19.200
every night and so he used to go across the you know Newport's transporter bridge he used to go

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:26.560
with his motorbike across there. Really? Yeah um that well that was being open very early in the

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:32.480
morning and in those days that's what it did was carry workmen but of course now it's just a tourist

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:39.760
attraction yeah. Oh god so he went across there on his motorbike? Yeah yep he rode his motorbike

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:50.320
everywhere and when he wasn't riding as I was. You really? Oh yeah. With a helmet or a headscarf?

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:58.640
Helmet always a helmet yes always a white moon of the black peak I can even remember

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:06.240
picturing it now yeah. Oh my god. Yeah yeah. So did do do you know the levels well then? I mean do

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:12.880
you call it the levels or the moors? Both. Both? I would I would probably call it the moors I don't

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:18.160
know much about the other side of Newport but I do know this end. Yeah yeah. So what other things do

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:24.720
you know about this end that might um people use? Has anyone ever told you about the balaclava pub?

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:31.200
No. No? If you go up the Marshfield road and you've got um a right hand bend before that bend there

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:38.480
was a pub called the balaclava and it was run by Ansells the brewers and behind the balaclava was a

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:46.320
big um distribution depot of Ansells and um then eventually got demolished um

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:54.160
we all went there one Christmas Eve from the dairy we went there lunchtime we got plastered

00:21:54.160 --> 00:22:02.400
all of us and we came back down to the dairy and up in the laboratory we had one of the directors

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:09.120
Mr Rainer with us and he went into the laboratory and he just laid flat on the floor and he had

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:14.480
silby hat and he just put it on his face like this and went fast asleep and the whole the afternoon

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:22.080
we had to step over him it was hilarious oh dear dear dear it was so funny yeah that was in the

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:27.680
balaclava i can't remember when it got demolished quite a long time ago what about church did you

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:33.200
go to church here or where did you i didn't go to church here i go to church in do you know the

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:40.640
cat marbly pub no um it's the other side of the main road anyway in the village called michelson

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:46.800
and i go to st michael's yeah yeah and i also joined the baptists and we don't have a service

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:51.760
on a Sunday evening so i usually join the baptist for their service because they're just in you know

00:22:51.920 --> 00:23:01.200
marshfield so are there any traditions or stories that are associated with this area um because

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.840
somebody told me something could go at roping so at the wedding you'd have a rope across the entrance

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:13.280
oh i didn't know that yeah yeah i didn't know that um this lane was called market road in that

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:19.680
those days and if you go along this lane not far past here on the left hand side there's a derelict

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:25.680
building all with um sheets of um tin and whatnot and that was the market the cattle market before

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:32.000
they moved to newport really yeah yeah when was this um when i was working in the day so in the

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:39.040
1950s so you remember market day here yeah yeah well what was that like it must have been very

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:45.760
traffic everywhere yes it was and um yeah i remember the market being here and then of course they

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:52.640
moved to newport and then very recently they're called well one last i don't know

00:23:54.240 --> 00:24:01.760
10 years i suppose um the cattle market closed and they've got a big answer there now yeah yeah

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:08.160
so the big one there's one that raglan now isn't it yeah yeah that's where um the the business from

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:15.440
newport market moved to raglan yeah so so so there's a sidings here yeah so would cattle

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:22.640
and livestock come on no no no they'd only come um come in trailers or horse boxes no so it was

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:28.320
it was only the milk that ever went from here so what sort of livestock came to market do you

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:36.320
remember oh cattle and sheep yep lots of cattle lots of sheep yeah do you remember the auction

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:41.440
ring was there an auction ring or they're just pens i didn't in that time have any i worked

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:47.040
with the dairy in that time and i didn't have any animals of my own so i really wasn't interested

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:51.680
and then of course when it moved to newport and then we used to sell our lambs through through

00:24:51.680 --> 00:25:00.080
there and um yeah um and bought the odd ram or the odd you or whatever so i came i came along this

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:07.360
yeah yeah so um so there is um there is like a big old barn there that's it

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:13.840
and that was that was a cattle market yes market yeah if you have an aerial photo on from google

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:19.600
earth you can see the marks where the pens were outside it oh gosh you can't from the ground

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:28.400
level but um one of my neighbors uh googled it and you it was amazing really prominent you could see

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:34.640
where the where the pens used to stand so was it all outside yeah apart from in apart from the

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:41.200
auction ring which was undercover yeah so on was market day one day a week or several days no one

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:46.800
day a week yeah do you remember what day um i don't remember it would probably been the same here

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:51.520
as it was in newport in newport it was wednesday so i would imagine it was probably wednesday here

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:58.400
so was it difficult to move for traffic and people and buses well it didn't um it didn't

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:06.560
affect me because i was in work before and i went to went home after the the livestock um and a lot

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:12.480
used to come from the what we call the low road so they were to come over the over the bridge and

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:18.000
you know before they got here and turned down the lane yeah yeah yeah oh that's so that's called

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.600
market lane colloquially it was yeah it isn't now everyone calls it team our lane but i always

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:29.200
knew it as market road really yeah that's fascinating when it got called team our i

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:36.960
haven't a clue not a clue any other places have got names at the local that are no i don't think

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:44.240
so the we in marshfield the first place you come to now is um pentune terrace and that was built

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:50.480
for the dairy workers when they first opened the dairy yeah and then we get to merrishfield

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:57.520
close again for dairy workers yeah yeah so when did the dairy open then i don't know i really don't

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:07.040
know um all i know was when i joined it the woman who was in charge of the lab before me had been

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:13.760
there 14 years so it would have been back into the 1940s and probably beyond then i really don't know

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:22.160
so it was a quite a you know big business oh it was big yes yes it was big yeah so did most people

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:26.960
who were there did they come locally or did they come further afield most of them were local yes

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.560
and when we had snow i had land rover tires on the back of my car and it was my job to go down

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:40.240
and around the out outline buildings and bring the workers into work because mine was the only

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:48.960
vehicle that would go down there really yeah yeah that was the big snow in 1963 62 63 yeah

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.600
you even had snow here then oh crumbs yes we didn't have snow here yeah because it doesn't

00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:00.720
i was told it it's very not very often you'll get snow no we had no snow this year and i don't think

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:09.760
we had any last year um but then the snow was packed on the main road on the a48 till march

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:16.240
and it was just packed snow that we were driving on all the time yeah yeah so what was it like

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:21.680
down here at marsh fields um much the same as the main road because it's you have quite heavy

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:28.240
traffic down here um but when you got down to the bottom there weren't many vehicles that could go

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:33.680
along the bottom road because that was pretty bad but my old car could do it she chugs through

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:40.880
anything yep trust so it so you had the dairy and you had the cattle market one time so was

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:46.400
there a finished shop and thing like that then yes we had we had the shop the same shop as in

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:51.280
marshfield now okay and it's been altered and extended and whatnot and it's a very good shop

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:57.200
yeah you could live out of that shop apart from fresh veg they keep potatoes in but no other

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:03.600
fresh veg yeah but other than they've got a pharmacy the pharmacy and the post office in general

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:12.560
yeah oh yeah what about um flooding have you ever had flooding here flooding uh not here but when

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:22.080
we lived at tinnen ant as i say coy curnew when they built the motorway um 1966 they put all the

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:30.480
drainage from the construction into the stream that ran past our house and our house if you can

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:39.200
imagine our house was there and the stream used to come right around our house and in 1975 it was

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:46.480
they it had rained so much that the stream couldn't take it so instead of going around

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:52.400
our house it came straight through our house and we were flooded up to about the depth of other

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:59.360
not over our wellington about that much and the house would like that for oh crumbs probably a

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:07.760
week so what happened fortunately we we built we bought this old cottage and um converted it

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:14.800
ourselves and built on the kitchen and bathroom and my husband had had the the electric plugs

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:20.800
put at waist high instead of down so we were okay for electric you see because there's nothing

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:27.520
below that always we were we were wearing wellingtons in the in the house and then when

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:33.680
we went to bed you there's this rural wellingtons halfway up the stairs it was horrible it was

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:42.960
absolutely awful yeah did you get compensation um our house was insured and the contents and

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:50.720
everything fortunately with the company that my father worked for um and so we did we got the price

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:57.440
of a new carpet and what we actually did was had our carpet um uh hung up and and dried and put back

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:02.880
down again we steam cleaned it you know while it was hung up um and we had but we had the price of

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:08.960
a new carpet so we did quite well out of it actually and um the price of the furniture as well

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:14.960
which we simply dried and kept on using and so we we did make quite a couple of bobbies

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:22.320
i can't remember how much but it was but the motorway constructors they didn't say oh no no no no no

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:29.600
they didn't want to know so you remember the area before the motorway went in yep what was it like

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:38.000
like it is now except for the motorway yeah it was just um i had some friends whose house

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.760
had to be demolished you know right in the path of it yeah yeah and we worked on that with the

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:51.120
jcbs for quite a long time yeah so so you had some friends whose house was um compulsory purchase

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:58.160
yeah so what was that like for them was it difficult i don't remember i know that they had to move and

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:04.480
they did move and i think the compensation they had was good um but i don't really remember much

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:11.520
about it except that their house was bang slap in them in the way yeah so was there any opposition

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:16.960
to the motorway going through i don't remember there being any opposition they may well have

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:23.520
been but i really don't think there was so your husband or your company worked on the motorway

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:31.440
yeah really yeah yes i can claim to have driven my car the wrong way on the motorway because i

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:37.280
i used to uh deliver fuel to them and whatnot on and pick up truck and then of course there's

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:44.800
no traffic anyway so i so i've actually driven the wrong way down the m4 that's amazing yeah what

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:56.080
stretch um beyond cardiff and back then beyond newport through the tunnels i think back to the

00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:02.960
cauldron in the next junction back god how long was your were you working on it for then

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:08.880
i mean i imagine there were lots of other oh yes yes and lots of others um oh crammed i don't know

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:19.920
probably about two years yeah massive job yeah it was it was massive yeah did they find anything

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:27.360
when they were doing the motorway don't think so no i don't think so if they did i didn't hear about

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:34.720
it so you were up there before it even opened oh yeah it was your job to deliver fuel yep

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:42.560
yeah that wasn't that was my thursday job no it wasn't that was my tuesday job yeah go around all

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.680
the sites collect all the time sheets from the drivers give them fuel on hydraulic oil if they

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:53.840
needed it carries a couple of spare wheels as well in case they needed it and that was my tuesday

00:33:53.840 --> 00:34:00.800
job and my thursday job was to work out the wages and then friday deliver all the wages around the

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:08.000
sites along the motorway along well along everywhere up as far as brinmower all over the place wherever

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.720
they were working so presumably that was cash in little brown envelopes yes but but properly done

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:21.040
you know not not um uh cash in an envelope but proper wage slips it was all it was all correct

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:25.920
yes yeah everything was in a little brown envelope yeah with your wage slip in that's it but you

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:30.960
wouldn't get that ever now i don't suppose you would i don't know the last time i was ever paid

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:36.480
in cash for anything yeah you know you know with a with a wage slip yep so so you would have had to

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:42.240
go to a bank and get all the money out yes yes i drew the money out friday morning and took the

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:48.720
wages out friday afternoon no thursday afternoon i drew the money from the bank and then did the

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:54.880
wages early friday friday morning and because it was all done manually then you had the national

00:34:54.880 --> 00:35:02.320
insurance tables and whatnot um and then set off around the site and deliver it so to get onto the

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:08.160
motorway before it was open did you have to have a special pass or anything like that no no there

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:13.760
empty entrances to the motorway you know when about every road junction you could have got on

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:19.920
or off the motorway so was it did he help make the tunnels the yeah oh yes we worked on the

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:28.880
bring grass tunnels yes and the boot town tunnels in cardiff yes crazy yeah so the insurance for the

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:37.280
boot town tunnels i am told but i i can't see that anyone would have made it up the insurance

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:46.400
the insurance premium allowed for 10 men to be killed on that project my god and my husband saw

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:54.640
one man killed he jumped on a dumper um what they did they cast the roof of the tunnel first

00:35:54.640 --> 00:36:00.240
and then everything was down through holes in in the in the tunnel and they were big wide holes

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:05.920
you know half the size of this room and this man jumped on a dumper because it was in his way

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:12.320
it wasn't his dumper and the throttle stuck open and he went straight down the hole and was killed

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:20.480
the dumper turned over halfway down and squashed him they think if it had gone down solidly might

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:27.040
have lived and it was awful because he had second children really really tragic that was yeah

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:35.360
very tragic and my husband saw that happen it really upset him yeah gosh it upset him yeah

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:43.520
ah yep so did were there um was it mostly local people who were working on the diggers or did you

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:50.720
have irish or oh no no they were all pretty local yeah yeah yeah either from here or from up the

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:56.400
valleys we had a couple of drivers from pont de priz and and but mainly you know local yeah

00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:01.920
were you involved in the um the lamb worm construction no not at all no

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:10.960
the only thing i remember land weren't were they had hundreds of lorries delivering shelter

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:18.880
and i was on my vespa scooter coming along the a48 towards cardiff of my vespa and one lorry was

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:24.880
in front of me and one lorry was right on behind me and one was there on my outside and they were

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:30.960
playing with me they and they did they scared a lot of me because they were so close and

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:39.120
before you get to the roundabout towards cardiff there's a turning left a little lane and i shot

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:45.840
down there but they really scared me and they were they were in game with me really but if i'd stopped

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:52.480
or swerved or anything i wouldn't be here now oh so i i went i shot off down the lane and then

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:58.160
they went on but it scared me really scared me because you're so vulnerable aren't you oh yes

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:04.800
yes yeah yeah what about um they're going to do an extension well they want to do an extension

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:12.320
of the m4 don't they yeah yeah i mean do you have any fears about that none at all simply because i

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:17.840
i'd be dead long before they get around to doing it so no they can do what they like

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:25.200
but do you ever visit the other part of the levels do you ever visit the levels on the other side of

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:35.680
the estuary no no i never have no but uh yeah what about newport then the dogs do you remember

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:42.640
anything any of that no not much it didn't affect me at all no um

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:53.680
i i've been down and the there was um an engineering firm called archway engineering

00:38:54.160 --> 00:39:00.080
and if we made if we broke any bits of the diggers they could always repair it for us it was

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:07.040
what about did you was your husband or your business ever involved in making the seawall

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:16.000
oh yes before we got married um martin worked for the drainage board and um he did a lot of the

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:22.320
hiring the seawall and then with massive stones and then covering it in soil and grass and whatnot

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:29.600
yes yeah he did a lot of that yes because he's owned that seawall between me and between us

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:34.480
and getting flooded up to there i know it's quite a thought isn't it yeah we're below sea level here

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:40.560
yeah what about um uh do you ever think about that being below sea level or do you just

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:49.440
live with it don't ever think about it no what about um did did you or your husband ever go fishing

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:56.880
oh my husband fished yes he fished on the on the river y um up beyond usk

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:05.280
really yeah he salmon fished for salmon yeah yeah oh he loved fishing and i like an idiot

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:11.200
went with him one day he said why don't you come and i sat on that bank for hours and hours and

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:20.960
hours oh no i only did it once i never did it again so no fishing off the seawall or into the

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:28.320
reeds um they do fish from the seawall i believe um yeah apparently they have caught cod and

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:35.520
quite big fish off the seawall but i don't know who does it and um they also fish along this lane

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:40.560
oh really there's a massive fish in this rain and he's been caught hundreds of times

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:44.640
and he's about like that apparently i've never seen him i only know what people are saying

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:48.960
and he's a massive fish and every time they catch him of course they throw him back and he's been

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:55.760
caught it seems that he enjoys being caught and then having the hook taken out his mouth and

00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:02.880
chucked back in yes what's this ring called do you know no i don't um the one going down on down the

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:08.160
marshfield road is the broadway okay um but i don't know what this one is i don't think it's

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:16.560
got a lane a name yeah so they chuck the fish back in yeah yeah oh yes yeah i think he's a pike

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:23.520
he's not um he's not a neatable fish anyway yeah no what about the seven bridge did we ever involved

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:30.560
in that uh we were involved in building the second seven bridge yeah yeah um on this side

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:36.720
of the river but doing the the just the ground work for the new preparatory for building the

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:42.880
bridge yeah i've worked there for quite a long time yeah did they find anything there no

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:51.600
not as far as i know no unless they didn't didn't tell me so that was that's relatively recently

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:58.640
isn't it um yes because the old seven ridge was 1966 correct me because that was the year my

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:06.720
elder son was born yeah um so that was 1966 i don't know when they did this one um

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:17.920
probably the 1980s ish i don't know i don't either i would say 90s you could well be right the 90s

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:23.680
yes 90s yeah definitely 90s early 2000s maybe yeah we don't think of it as being new anymore

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:28.720
which we did in those days yes yeah yeah how long were they working on the bridge for then

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:35.200
well you know not not terribly long um it was a preparatory work to you know going over the

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:43.520
actual water yeah and um there's if you you go up approach to the bridge now on the left hand side

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:50.880
across the stretch of water is um a timber yard and i went there once i had to deliver something

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:55.600
there but i stopped it was fascinating that they were floating a section of the bridge down

00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:01.280
the river and i stopped and what i couldn't say there all the time because of course it wasn't

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:08.000
a very fast operation they had yeah and i'd love to have seen them hoisted up into place but i

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:15.280
didn't have the time yeah that would be a concrete cliff yes yeah that's incredible it was incredible

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:20.080
they lifted it up and yeah and then of course they tarmacked over it um it was only sort of

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:24.960
the framework of the bridge they did they've tarmacked it once it was in place and they made

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:31.040
those in chapstow the the bits for the bridge yeah oh did they yeah i didn't know that and um

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:38.000
one of the you know we used to have a ferry across the river then yeah one of the ferries is i can't

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.840
remember which one my son did tell me because he saw it they're restoring one of the ferries

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:52.400
in chapstow are they yep i didn't know that either um and he he saw it anyway yeah and he

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:57.440
said they were well on with them so i presume they'll just have it at the museum i suppose

00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:03.680
oh that'd be interesting to find yeah it would did you ever go on it no oh we went on it yeah

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:09.680
when we when it was operational across the air oh yes what was that like it was okay but it

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:15.200
depended on the tide and sometimes you'd wait four hours for the tide to be high enough to

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:25.200
really yeah and then we on my vespa scooter we did a we went on holiday down to Bournemouth and

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:31.680
that sort of area and when we came back when they went to put it on the ferry it skidded off the

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:38.320
ferry into the water glory me what your scooter my scooter yeah so everyone grabbed it and got it

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:43.040
back on and i was terrified that the engine wouldn't work because it had been under water but

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:49.120
when we got the other side thank goodness it was okay but we nearly lost it we really nearly lost

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:55.040
it i was lucky yeah the back we just skidded off there's quite a lot of mud on the ramp yeah

00:44:55.040 --> 00:45:00.400
and he's got him and and we were driving and my husband was standing alongside it driving it up

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:06.880
onto the thing and the back we did shit into the water oh boy happy days i've forgotten about that

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.720
see when i see pictures of it it looks completely open

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:16.400
what did you do when it was crossing was there somewhere you could sit inside

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:23.920
no no no no no you just stayed in your car but you had a motorbike well you stayed with your motorbike

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:29.120
fair enough you couldn't get in a motorbike i appreciate that we just stood there until

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:35.920
we got the other side only a couple of minutes and so it was because it looks very um oh it didn't

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:44.560
take long precarious um precarious would probably write but it was the way everybody crossed was on

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:50.880
the ferry yeah unless you want to go all up around cluster and come down again yeah yeah so we used

00:45:50.880 --> 00:46:00.400
to yeah yes and then of course oh there's many a time that um we were in the queue to go on the

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:05.760
ferry and there'd be only a couple of cars in front of us and by then the level of the water

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:12.240
would have dropped too much we had to sit there for four hours oh yeah and we did that a couple

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:18.960
of times sat for four hours oh i mean was there somewhere to have a cup of tea or an ice no no no

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:26.400
the other side there was yeah there was a cafe there and um and sort of a a shop as well yeah

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:32.000
and you could get a drink there and buy spice sweets and whatnot but not this side only the

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:38.160
other side yeah so just where exactly was the ferry where did it come in was it by it was where

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:47.120
at brook yeah it was under the old seven bridge okay okay the it was just a couple of yards either

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:53.520
side of the old seven bridge the ramp up yeah yeah do you remember when the first bridge opened

00:46:54.480 --> 00:47:04.960
uh i remember it's 1966 and it was because i was expecting um hayden then and it was about

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:11.840
april time he was born in december but it was i was just expecting him when it came when it opened

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:17.360
that was the old one the new one i can't remember when it opened yeah now they've taken the tolls

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:22.400
away i know it's fantastic yeah it didn't affect me because i got a blue badge anyway but um

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:27.520
so i didn't have to pay to cross the bridge anyway but you don't have to wait at the cold

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:32.880
deep booth oh we had to wait at the toll booth until you show show the badge and they took the

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:40.560
particulars and then let you go but now of course there's no no tolls at all now you've got a lot of

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:49.280
stories pan haven't you i thought i just i never thought i never thought of that i i really didn't

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:55.200
know it's an interesting perspective though you know yeah the diggers and the yeah the big

00:47:55.200 --> 00:48:02.560
infrastructure projects you're involved oh yeah and then um there's a big building in newport road

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:09.040
in cardiff um head and house and we did all the foundations for that and because it was such a big

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:17.200
building it had a very deep foundations yeah and we had to um dig ourselves onto a platform where

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:22.560
the digger could stand and then dig down a bit further and stand on that platform until we were

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:30.800
right at the the level where they wanted the the foundations to be why yeah gosh yep yes did you

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:37.440
ever operate a digger yourself a digger yeah only around the yard in you know when not not out on

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:43.040
site ever but if i could drive them around the yard if they wanted to move from here to there sort

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:50.080
of thing yeah yeah yeah so there are any other stories you'd like to add i can't think of any

00:48:50.080 --> 00:49:06.960
characters you met or no no our mp paul flin has died recently and um i was involved with him um

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:15.440
um on we had a yard building a yard down the bottom and when we moved out of there

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:23.840
the people who took it on rented it um but not from us from we rented it and they rented after

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:27.840
and they wanted to do something i can't even remember what it was but it was against the

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:35.440
planning laws anyway and i had to go to a meeting with paul flin and a lot of other interested

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:43.040
people and say my piece and that was it and a couple of years later there was something going

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:50.480
on and there were plans of it in the village hall just going down from castleton just as on the bend

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:56.880
that's the the village hall and um and as i said it was a couple of years later and i was very

00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:01.360
impressed because when i went in paul flin was there but i didn't know he was until i got in

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:08.160
and the first he said oh mrs robertson how are you and i was amazed with all the people that he

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:15.280
met that he knew my name or remembered my name that's a good politician isn't it yeah a very

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:24.560
very good politician yes yeah yeah he was great and um my friend who is an accountant um she's

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:31.440
just got a small business doing farmers accounts and whatnot and um one of her clients had two

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:37.600
polish workers and they were going home the next day but when they had come into the country

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:42.720
they'd had to give in their passports to the home office and they had all their tickets to go the

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:50.320
next day and the home office couldn't find the passport so um my friend jennifer what am i going

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:55.520
to do for him and i said well why don't you ring paul flin see if he can help so she said

00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:01.840
we all need help with that i said well try him so she rang and spoke to his um secretary which was

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:08.880
a man and within two hours the passports came by courier to her house wow well that's impressive

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:16.400
yeah yeah that is impressive he was a very very good good mp he'd be sorely missed i think he was

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:22.960
84 i think oh gosh yeah yeah he really was he was older than me but not a lot older he wasn't

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:29.600
sitting in office though he wasn't sitting in office he was yes until he died yes why but he

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:34.720
wasn't going to stand at the next election but we never got there not yet we haven't anyway

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:42.400
with all this brexit nonsense oh gosh have you got any photographs of your dairy days no none at all

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:49.520
no no no no no we were never much of a family for taking photographs

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:52.880
i have a lovely one of my pony but on that's all

00:51:55.520 --> 00:52:01.600
i must be mad because this photograph is she was a very fiery pony out across west mountain she

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:08.320
really was very feisty and i it's over there i'll show you before you go yeah she's standing in the

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:14.480
middle of the road with no one holding her yeah outside my parents house oh and i don't know how

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:19.520
we could be nuts enough to leave her standing on her own because she was quite capable whipping

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:24.800
around on her hind legs and galloping off up the street really yeah i don't remember ever taking

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:31.840
the photograph um but i had a big birthday party uh last year yeah and my friend who i used to ride

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:37.120
with when we were kids she had this photograph of her that she gave me it was absolutely super so

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:43.920
you're a rider then you yeah yeah had horses all my life i've still got one now but it's out on

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:51.280
permanent loan yeah yeah so where did you ride everywhere around the country lanes here

00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:59.120
there wasn't as much traffic on the roads then as there is now of course yep yeah dona and i had a

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:07.600
um a Welsh cob between us called of all things called lucky what a stupid name to give the horse

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:16.320
but uh yeah we we rode a lot don't ride a lot and yeah do just have fun riding yeah would you ever

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:24.000
jump over the reeds on the horse and no no i didn't fancy getting wet

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:32.080
