00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
You see all the other agents are gone.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
They've been dead for a long while.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Yes, and the house has been sore for a while.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Of course, Minnie and Maggie did the front end for quite a long time after Josephine and James passed away.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Oh, didn't they?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And Tom...

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I didn't get to know them as well. I knew them, you know.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Tom, Tom, you know, well Tom liked his liquor too.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
They went over to the drugstore and Will died.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And Will went over to...

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Well, Will went over to Chatham Newcastle.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And I think one of them, was there a Harry among them?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
He lived down in St. Martin's Way.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And they were all dead.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Of course, I know all of them. Of course, they're descendants of him.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Were he a drugist too, that went over to Newcastle?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Yes, he was.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It seems to me that I read John.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Yes, and John was, I'm sure, over there.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But they had a drugstore in St. John's.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Yes, that's where I'm from.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
John's, Dury.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
He was a very kind-hearted man.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
A man came to him, needing medicine, and didn't have the money to pay for it.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And he knew that Joseph couldn't get it, you know.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
He was just powered up.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
He would give him the medicine and wait for his pay.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It seems to me, Aunt May, I've heard you mention more than once about these people.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The Dures. You always found them friendly people.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Oh, yes, yes I did.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
But Uncle Frank didn't seem to...

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Well, it was Uncle Frank's fault.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
He wasn't one of them. He knew the Mickeys.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
But they're still all their own relatives.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And they were the only people.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And they were the only...

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Well, look, Margaret, that would be Louis' girl.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Do you remember Louis Phillips?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Zemmer does.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Louis lived up here off the road.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And his girl, Margaret, was the head of the nurses over in the Lancaster when Ruthie worked there.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
When Ruthie was at the Lancaster Veterans Hostel.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Oh, yes.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And Ruthie, of course, was a female auditor.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
She said, Ruthie, why don't you go in training?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Well, your status would be a lot better what's in now.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
She said, you're capable and smart.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And she said, why don't you go in training and get your RN?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We see Ruthie tried over here and not paid enough attention and got put out.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And they wouldn't take her back.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So she rode up to the outermost and asked if she could train there.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And the doctor told her she didn't have a personal interview.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
But she told her what had happened down here.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So Ruth went up.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And she told her the whole thing.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
She said, I don't think I'll have any trouble that way now.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
She said, I used to go to sleep in class.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I couldn't bank my keep of mind on it.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
She didn't.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And I said, I'm quite a lot older now.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
She said, 25.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
She was only 18 before.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And she said, if I give...

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
If you'll give me a chance, she said, I'll work.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Well, she said, it was almost.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
She said, I'll give you a chance.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And because she did, Ruthie worked like a dooker and got five prizes when she graduated.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And always had a soft spot in her heart for the major.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Well, this woman that you speak of, was instrumental in getting...

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Was she with Bonda Phillips?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Yes.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
You see, Lewis Phillips was your mother's first cousin.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And Margaret was his daughter.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And she asked me about Ruth one time.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And I was out with Lewis at the store.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I was out with the two of them down at the mini store one day.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I think Lewis had been dead since then.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
But she was very nice indeed.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And I told her I wanted to thank her for her good advice to Ruth.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I said, we've been after you.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And she tried to get training and she went back to the road building.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And she said, all she needed was what you said, encouragement.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So I felt she was better, she was well-prepared to be a nurse.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And I better than just being ordered.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So I felt that she had a lot to do with getting Ruth to do training.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
She was very nice indeed.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I don't see how I need that fire.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
I'm sinking.
