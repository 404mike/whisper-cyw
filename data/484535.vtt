Carder Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.200
Interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.000
Interviewee Heather Brown.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.400
Location Swicker Office.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.400
Today's date the 29th of September 2015.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.000
Heather, would you be kited up for the record to spell your name in full?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.400
Yes, it's Heather.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.000
H-E-A-T-H-E-R Brown.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
B-R-O-W-N.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.400
Thank you very much indeed.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.400
Carder Carnival obviously dates back to 1990.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.400
Can you remember when you first got involved and in what capacity?

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.400
Well, I recall first seeing the carnival around about 1994, 95,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.800
when I watched various parades.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.400
But I got involved, I think, in 1997

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.800
when I started working for Cardiff Council, initially as a production assistant

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.800
and then in later years as the development manager,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.400
where I kind of worked more closely with Steve in terms of developing routes

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.200
and looking at venues and trying to decide where to go next

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.000
and trying to help with places for the camp, etc.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.800
So at various different levels I've worked with the carnival

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.800
for, well, it's nearly 20 years.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.400
And you have the emotional scars to prove it.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.000
I have, yes.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Absolutely.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Now, one thing I've always enjoyed about working with Heather,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
who is better known as Hetty, is your unflappability.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.200
Carnival is a riot of colour.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.000
It's certainly not a riot in a political sense,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.400
but there's an energy and enthusiasm and a libertarian outlook

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.800
which can be daunting to some.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.000
But I think it's true to say in all the time we've worked together,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.600
have you ever come close to losing your carnival cool?

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.600
I don't think I have.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.600
I mean, I enjoy the chaos.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.600
I think that's the truth of it.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.400
There is an element of not knowing what's going to happen.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.800
There is an element of just kind of starting off and seeing where it goes.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.800
But most of the time I can honestly say I've really enjoyed it.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.200
I mean, we have had some really insane moments.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.000
And I think the half naked blue ladies of whichever carnival that was

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
spring to mind in terms of not knowing what the reaction to that was going to be like.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.800
We've had some crazy people join us on the parade.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.600
That's always one that is kind of hard to predict.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.400
You know, the participants usually know what's expected of them and where they're going.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.200
But, you know, so many times people have just stepped in.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.600
And again, you know, have been either encouraged or discouraged,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.600
depending on their general behaviour.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.600
Yeah.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.600
But no, you know, I think, you know, weather as well.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.800
I mean, we've had some ferocious weather to contend with sometimes.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.000
And again, I think the fact that there's a deluge years as is known in the company.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.600
2005, six and seven, three in a row, five, six and seven.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.400
And we're talking not rain, not precipitation.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.600
We're talking complete whiter.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.200
And we're talking all day.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.000
So that's during the setup, during the parade.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.200
So our audience is affected and those who appear

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.800
turn up in like full body sou'esters, which is they've just come off a trawler ship or something.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.800
And I think, again, the thing that I've always admired about the participants

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.400
is they're just up for it regardless.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.000
It's weatherproof in that sense.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
They've worked so hard.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.400
They've put everything into the sort of the two weeks or the two months

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.600
or however long they've been working and preparing and what they're doing.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.000
And they just they want to do it regardless.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.400
And I think only once have we postponed it for a day.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.800
Was there one year where we didn't do it on the Saturday, but we did it on the Sunday?

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.200
I don't think there was in all honesty.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.200
You think we've always put it on the act of it?

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:06.800
The only parade we've ever postponed, and it was postponed, it was cancelled, was actually

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:13.000
not the Cardiff Carnival itself, but the first ever time we attempted to remount it

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.800
for Cardiff Bay Development Corporation.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:23.400
And it was the day on which the evening before Lady Diana had died in a car crash in Paris.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.800
And then the morning came and then gradually it became apparent as football matches were being cancelled.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.000
That was the Rainbow Festival.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.800
Yeah, there we are.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.400
It was going to be the Rainbow Festival.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.800
Yes.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.000
And the news came through when we were building the site really early in the morning, sort of like 6 o'clock, I think.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.600
Yeah, all over the UK, everything was being cancelled.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.400
And so that's the only one that, yes, I think I would remember if it had been postponed its entirety.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.400
I mean, the other thing that I have to say to the credit as myself, as one of the organisers, is

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.800
the carnival has never not started exactly on time.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.200
And if you've ever tried to organise hundreds of excited people and to get them in the right line up,

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:18.600
all things to actually be able to do what it says on the tin as advertised, it will start at this time.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:25.000
You know, in 26 years, you know, I've never looked at you or Yanis, your colleague and said we're not ready.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.800
No, that's absolutely true.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:34.400
And anyone who's ever seen that kind of time before it sort of steps off where, you know, everybody's getting ready,

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.600
be it in the car park of the atrium or, you know, at Buton Community Centre or wherever it was,

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.600
you know, there's just this gradual build up and build up of excitement and kind of buzz.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.200
And it's almost like, you know, you're not going to contain it any longer.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.800
You know, if it's going to go, it's going to go.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.600
And if it's going at two, it goes at two because everybody's ready.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:58.000
And, you know, that's really impressive to see and very exciting, I think, to watch the start of the parade

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.400
because, you know, everybody can't wait.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.400
It's kind of, you know, what they've been working towards.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.400
So that's always been a fantastic place to be.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.600
I've enjoyed being at the start of the parade and sort of seeing all that.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.600
And also, I think, just, yeah, some of the amazing costumes and creations down the years.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.400
And we've kind of gone through various phases of trying different things,

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.200
of kind of trying to bring in Simon Systems, going back to being everything on foot,

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.800
trying to build different sculptures, working with lots of different artists and all of those things.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.600
Kind of each building on the other to get you back to where you end up.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.800
And I'm sure if anybody looked at the very first carnival and the one that we just had this summer,

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:47.000
you know, the kind of journey of all of the people who've been involved from the beginning to the end in terms of their

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.400
their creativity and their skills and, you know, their abilities is just huge.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.800
No, absolutely. And of course, as you mentioned, we've taken different routes, different,

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.000
we've started at different places, we've had the carnival camps at different places

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.400
and we've had the outcomes in different places.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:10.600
And one of my faves, I have to say, has to be the steps of the National Museum of Wales,

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.100
which is an unlikely place for a stage.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:21.100
And yet, before they, you know, in order to make them accessible to everybody,

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.600
they placed those lovely brass railings through them.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.500
I mean, it was it was like a layer cake that we could end up on with different platforms,

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:36.800
everyone doing different dances or performances and then having something to say at the end.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:42.800
But I know that you were very much you very much helped us come down in less or see at times to to the bay

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.000
where we'd benefit from what can only describe as a rather wonderful roll off,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.400
a roll on, you know, a full on rock festival stage.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:08:01.000
And and even I recall a soaker version of the National Anthem of Wales with red, green and gold,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Caribbean colours, pyrotechnics.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.500
In terms of the outcomes, did you have a favourite or one that sort of comes to mind as work particularly well?

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.400
I mean, like we've staged it in all sorts of different ways.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.900
And although the full on stage was great,

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.700
I liked the sort of the catwalk bit that we added in.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:27.000
So at one point when we had the parade coming down the middle of the oval basin,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.200
we built like a ramp that it could go up and over so that everyone could see it.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:36.700
And I that to me kind of worked best because it was seeing the parade as it was meant to be seen as a parade

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.000
rather than as a sort of stage performance when everybody.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.500
Yeah, you know, they're at the end of the line and they're kind of, you know, letting off steam and celebrating.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.600
But the costumes are almost like meant to be seen.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.200
Yes, that's commented on decoded for the public.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:58.100
And I always felt that that was a really big step forward for us in terms of being able to present it to a big audience.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:03.400
I mean, we were, as you say, very lucky that we kind of were able to sort of work through those years

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:12.400
when the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation and subsequently Harbour Authority had funds to just to develop the area really.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.200
And the mass carnival, I think, was a very big part in sort of developing audiences down there

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:23.200
and, you know, getting people coming back to events and to see things in that part of town.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:31.300
Yeah, yeah. The support role of the council and I have to say the events team has been invaluable over time.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:39.500
So when I come late this interview now by declaring that Hetty, you are a carnival hero.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.800
Will you also take that message back to all your colleagues?

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:49.000
I mean, all the stewards, all the traffic management people, everybody who basically enabled it to happen.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.700
I mean, carnival is a huge bubble of excitement and goes across many grains of society.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:10:04.800
So to be able to be given that opportunity, you know, it really has been people open minded, fair, celebratory people like yourself

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.900
giving large scale celebration of crack of the whip.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.700
In fact, we did have whip crackers one year as I recall. Risk assessed that.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:19.200
So it's a personal and a collective. I hereby declare you a carnival hero.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.000
Thank you very much indeed. Thank you.
