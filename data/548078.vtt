00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The Seven of the Wind

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The seven of the wind, here on earth,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I can't even see going far,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
For to rightly know, rightly know,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
My worth ever being worth in part.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Thus my little dove, with him oying,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Coming down out of stormy green,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I told of thine, nor I missed,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
For I'll settle and carry your weight.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This of all the seven you have left,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I cry, my little dove, redeem,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And some honor of bearing,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I've garnered above all of clear.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
My seven o' lead and his sky roll,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I tell me I'm so beautiful, me.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I cry to you, dearly, a seven,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
A seven new yessing I hear,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:06.000
A seven new yessing I hear.
