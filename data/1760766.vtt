00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I just have to introduce this at the top Bob, that's okay. So I'm Marcia O'Mahony and I'm here with Simon Hicks and we're here today to interview Hickman, sorry Simon, Simon Hickman and we're here today to interview Bob Trett and it's Bob Trett, is that right?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
T-R-E-double T

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Okay and we're at Kaleon and it is Thursday April 25th 2019. So I'm just going to pop that down there Bob. It is going. Yeah, there we go.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I wonder Bob if we can start off, Simon and I are going to pitch in together.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Sure.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If you could just introduce yourself, who you are, your background.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Okay, well my name is Bob Trett. I wasn't born here but I used to be a curator at different museums and I was employed as the curator at the Newport Museum and Art Gallery in 1983.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I have to try and remember that exactly. And I had a double job, one was being the curator which had been like his administratively in charge in the museum and art gallery and to a lesser degree of tradiga house when he was in the council's control.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Although I had a very good curator there anyway so I didn't really have to do much. But the museum itself had moved in the 1960s and they were still in the process of re-displaying it.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The art gallery was fine, it had been completed but most of the museum needed re-displaying so one of the first jobs I was given by the council was to re-display the museum.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:02.000
There were various keepers there, staff, very clever people who knew a lot and in charge of collections some of them had been there for a long time.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:19.000
But the main collections were, if you like, the natural sciences including geology, a good geology collection, birds, in fact including I noticed the last ibis shot on the seven levels, way back sometime.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So they had the natural history collections, various types of stuff, a lot of it, stuffed animals of course.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:40.000
They had a very good archeology collection, mostly Roman from the Roman town of Coent, which is on the Etchley levels, from excavations in the 1900s.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:52.000
They had a very good social history collection, local history collection, well still do of course, and then of course the art collections which were on the floor above.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And they all linked in pretty well as well. So my job first of all was to start with re-displays and the first thing we did was to re-display the medieval collection.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:23.000
A lot of that's now gone but we did that because a lot of fresh medieval material was coming in, places like Skinfriff Castle and from Penhowar Castle and from Lanternie Priory and so on.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So it was a can-do-why collection. So anyway, so that was displayed, a lot of help from Caddo and other people to put it together.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And then the next section we did was on the local history collections, which started in sort of 18th century really, included the Chartists of course, because there's a good Chartist collection.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And then mainly on Newport Industry and Civic Life and so on. A lot of that is still there, it's adapted a bit now.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:11.000
But of course the port was there and they're still working and so on. So there was quite a lot of material which we couldn't show but some of which we could for the very first time.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And then we did the archaeology. Well the first part of the archaeology was the prehistory. And they'd already had some cases put in.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And we reckon there was about, the tools weren't very secure, but there was about 13 items in the collections from prehistory of Gwent, not just Newport.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And there was about 13 cases to put them in. So we were very short on material.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And so what happened was that we started to cultivate lots of metal detectors. Some of them had actually been on the levels and out there.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And I became involved with the Glamour Gwent Archaeological Trust. They went out and they were a great help.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:09.000
But the man that gave the most help to us, because he came in with a load of iron-edge pottery, which had my eyeballs going out like this, was a man called Derek Upton.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And Derek I think lived near Sudbrook. He was born out there. And even as a child he used to say he would wander over the seawall, almost as a toddler, and wander around to the mudflats and then came back and still alive.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:38.000
So he was a fascinating guy. We came very, very close. So whenever he found anything he would ring up and we would go out and have a look.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And various other colleagues and volunteers I had helping me, including a gentleman called Steve Parry, who was very brilliant at, he was a sort of archaeologist, come eco man, but he was very brilliant at spotting things.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:08.000
So Derek would point out stuff. So I went down and had a little investigation on the channel where all this iron-edge pottery was coming out of. And these two went walking along the foreshore.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:18.000
This was, what's never the place, I'll forget. Anyway, they finished up a place called Chappeltump, which was a couple of miles away.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
They came running back and said, we've got a prehistoric platform there.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
This is out in the estuary.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:38.000
This was in the estuary. And all sorts of stuff. So I went and had a look and there they had hurdles which had been laid down and were pegged in to the ground. But of course no idea of dates.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
But we had contacts with the University in Cardiff.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And we managed to get a whole series of radio comm dates done and things and this turned out to be Iron Age.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I can't remember offhand the date because I've been retired for so many years, but anyway it was Iron Age before the Romans.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And alongside it they started finding Bronze-Edge pottery.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And we found a Bronze-Edge working site which they had bits of flint obviously were brought in, big pits in which they were burning stuff.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And I even found a little bone piercing pin which had been manufactured.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And so the stuff from Chappeltump was quite important.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And then it just snowballed from there.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:37.000
This was at, oh I've forgotten the name of the place now, there's a pill down there, Magor Pill, which I started out from.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And Derek found all sorts of other stuff out there of all different periods.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And so we then followed him to Goldcliff.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And we went out to Goldcliff because he was discovering Mesolithic, some early prehistoric material coming up.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Broken bones and stuff that had been burnt.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And there was obviously an island there and trees had been burnt off.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:18.000
But there are lots of things like boar and wild deer and in the piece of a wild wolf, I think.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
So they were all mixed in with the charcoal and stuff.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So again we were able to get it dated.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And with some help from the University and the Trust, the Morgwain Archaeological Trust, we managed to start some surveys off there as well.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
So this was all happening very well.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Well, the next thing, we walked on a bit further and we started finding one thing after another after another after another.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:56.000
One of the most fascinating things, which we found all the way along the foreshore, was stumps of trees or trees which had fallen over.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And if you got there, you could be out there and you could be thinking you were actually in the forest.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
If you just look down, you can see where all the trees were.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So you know exactly how it was.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And of course the estuary is made up of layers of peat and layers of alluvium or clay.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
And there's a whole sammage of them.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And each tide drops extra mud down.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
But of course you get fierce storms and everything gets wiped away.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So this is why all these things were being discovered.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
We had a great time going through this.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And then we went a bit further on from Gouldcliffe, as I was saying.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And we bumped into more fishing traps, all sorts of stuff.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And then we suddenly found a hut.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Well, it's just the base of a hut.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
But it had partitions inside it and it had a reed floor.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And that turned out to be our nature.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And it was part of a small settlement.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
There were several of them around there.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And I think people were probably using them for cattle.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And it was really far too much for us to cope with on our own.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And then because the next thing happened, Derek rang up very excitedly and said,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
It had just been off Nash near the mouth of the usk.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And he'd come across, in the lower levels, embedded in the clay, a set of human footprints.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
So I mean we were busy photographing everything.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So by this point everybody knew what was happening.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
So all the archaeological bigwigs from around gathered together.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And we had a meeting at the University and the National Museum were there as well,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
because they had found some additional items there.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And we'd found an aurochs, which was quite interesting, at Nash as well,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
which is like a wild cow.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And this was a massive big thing.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Bits of it are on display in the museum.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
In fact, most of what's on display in the museum and the new prehistoric displays

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
came from the discoveries in the 7th century,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000
together with some more material which was found by metal detector users inland as well.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:30.000
So from having virtually nothing, we've changed it up in quite an important connection

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
covering a whole of prehistory, including hand axes,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:41.000
which are the earliest type of artefact you tend to find, and very rare.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
There were a couple that had been brought down by Glacier Laction, I imagine, into the estuary.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
So they're on display in the museum.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
I think the National Museum were a bit jealous of all this,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
but nevertheless everyone was very cooperative.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
So nobody had really gone out and done what you had done?

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Nobody really, no.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
There'd been one hut circle which had been excavated at Chapel Tump,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
perhaps known as Chapel Tump 1, a few years earlier by Stephen Oldhouse Green,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
who was the prehistorian at the National Museum of Wales.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
But it'd been a sort of wall off.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:31.000
There was other people working on the geology and the river flows and tidal things and all this.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And of course the whole area was SSSI as well, so there was that aspect of it all.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
But nobody really looked there.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And they'd looked on the other side, because obviously at Glastonbury,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
where, I can't remember what it's called now, it's because I'm getting old.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000
But anyway, there were all sorts of stuff come up from the wetlands on the other side.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And here we are.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Somerset Louse, yes.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
A little booklet like this shows the sort of stuff that they were fighting.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
We were fighting similar things as well.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:34.000
There was an enormously important site there, whose name, well near Glastonbury.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:42.000
So that was the sort of stuff that was known about.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
But obviously the same thing was happening on our side.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:53.000
After the prehistory on the mudflats into tidal area,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000
they started finding it in profusion on the Londonward side of the seawall.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000
In particular, we found, when they were doing some excavations of the Col de Cot Castle,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:12.000
part of a huge plank which was part of a Bronze Age boat and various other things,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
which was done through the Archaeological Trust.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
But then another one they found was a Roman boat,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
a virtually complete small Roman boat called the Barlands Farm Boat,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
when they were putting it in Guernierot Park.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000
So with the help of the Trust who were digging it,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and the Conservator we had, Kate Hunter, we excavated that,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000
and that came in the museum and that's in store with the Remains of Newport ship.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Other boats had been, we also discovered there was about an 1800 canal boat up at Newbridge, up the Usk.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
That was very early and all handmade, it was very interesting,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
but most of that was now gone, disappeared.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Where's it gone?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Well, it was excavated, and it was, you know, how big a canal boat is.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:14.000
They did it by putting a bund in the river,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
and they pumped it all out and there was this boat, and it was excavated and recorded.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And then they were thinking about what to do with it,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
and just at that moment they had one of these flash floods,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000
so the whole boat lifted out of the water, not the water, the river bed,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
and was taken over the bund and floated down several hundred yards,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
so it smashed up against the bank.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Now the man who was advising us, was a man called Professor John McGrail,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000
well-known eminent sort of maritime archaeologist.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
He said, well, it's actually not a bad thing,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
because he can now look at all the bits individually, which is what they did.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And the bits were then transferred to Newport to an old warehouse that's now gone,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
and they were recorded and a report published.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Bits were left in the museum, and I don't know whether,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
I think most of them are probably there and kept.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
How old was it?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
About 1800.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Gosh.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
But in fact it was all handmade, and it was flat-bottomed.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
It was so similar in many ways to the Roman boat,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
the way the fittings worked and so on, that that was the interesting part of it.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Was it like a tro, then?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Well, no, it was a canal boat, you know, pointy at both ends,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
and it was obviously towed from a towing post up the river.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000
I think it probably had a small mast as well, probably from up to Newbridge.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:59.000
And there was stuff used to come down the river from Newbridge to Caleon and then on to Newport.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
And when it was abandoned, because it was old,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
they just put it onto the river bankers to help the river defences.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
So that's how we found it.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
But that was the first one that created quite a stir.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
When was this? What sort of period was this? Was this the early 80s?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Well, it was probably built around about 1800 when the first canals were also coming in,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
although it seems to be no river craft rather than a canal boat.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
It doesn't sort of fit in with the early Monmouthshire canal boats.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
But it was found in the early 1980s, was it?

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Yes.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Yeah.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Yes, I've got slides.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
The trouble is that I used to know this off my heart and I forget it all,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
but I've got the record still.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
And most of the stuff went into the museum, the museum archives as well.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
So anyway, so that was Tridentic Boat.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Then there was the Roman boat, the Barlands Farm Boat.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Then there was the Caldecott Bronze Age Planks, but enormous.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:11.000
And then one medieval boat was found at Magor Pill.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
And quite frankly, we'd got enough going on to do that.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
So the National Museum were very keen to take that project on.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
So they did.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
They did.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
And what remained of that boat went into the National Museum collections,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
not on show, but it's there.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
But, you know, in essence, there was almost a unique collection of early boats

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
of different periods that had been found.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:47.000
And it would be nice at some point for them to all merge together and be displayed.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:56.000
But of course, the duel in the crown didn't happen until 2002 when the Newport ship,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:03.000
but that's a later story, I was in the museum until about 2000.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:11.000
And we had a steady programme of material coming in and recording it.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
And we were sort of in the early stages of computerising records.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
So all that came in.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:27.000
When I came there, there were handwritten cards and nice little volumes of accessions

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
with little hand-drawn pictures in some places next to a description.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
And now, of course, it's all digital and everything else.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
So totally different goal game.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000
And of course, the photography, the fact that you get digital photography has changed everything.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.000
So all the old photographs, probably not similar ones I've got actually,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:58.000
but have now been digitalised or on archives, in the archives, on the museum or wherever.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000
And of course, the other aspect was a lot of publication went on as well.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
So that was my involvement.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:15.000
But the Newport ship, I think you described it as the duel in the crown.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Can you tell us about that? Were you there when it was discovered?

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Yes, I was.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
At what point did you get involved?

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Well, it's quite interesting because when I retired from the museum,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
I moved here and I was mainly doing guided tours around Killian.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:39.000
But I was still involved with the Glenborne Quintine Archive Archaeological Trust based in Swansea.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
And for many years I've been the chairman of the trustees.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
So I had a very close link with the staff there.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000
And they were called in to do a watching brief on a piece of land,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
which was where the New Riverfront Theatre was going to be.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:05.000
And they phoned me quite excitedly because Kate Howell, who was the girl that was running it at the time,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:12.000
said they'd found some curved timbers just underneath where the orchestra pit,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
we know all this anyway.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
So they were quite excited.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:25.000
And so it looked like it was a boat or a ship, but nobody knew how big it was or exactly what date it was.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
And it had a sort of key over the top.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.000
So it was probably pre-1800s, but that's about all you could say.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:41.000
So after some argument and debate with the council, they tried to keep very quiet about it.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Why did they try to keep quiet about it?

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Well, because if this turned out to be a big, massive thing, it would hold the whole project up.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
They weren't insured for this sort of hold-up.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
And it could have cost them, well, it did in the end, millions.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
So they kept very quiet about it.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:11.000
But of course I knew because through the trust and also because my friendship with the staff in the museum was still there

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
because I used to go in and help them and tell them where things were and so on.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:26.000
So it was agreed that they could excavate at least part of it, which they did.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:33.000
And what they found was that it stretched from one side of where the orchestra pit was to the other side,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000
a little bit missing on either end beyond this or massive big iron-covered dams had been put in.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:46.000
But most of it was inside, you know, if you were going to plan an excavation and you had to put a pit in,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:53.000
you would almost put it exactly where it is, maybe a bit longer just to get the stern and the brow in.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:05.000
But nobody still knew what the date was until one of our colleagues, Nigel Naling, who's now a professor,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:12.000
I actually interviewed him for a job on the 7th Street a long time ago, but he's gone up in the world.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:27.000
And he's a dentrotron and he was able to date a particular timber mixed up with it to 1457 or 8 or 9 or sometime around about then.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.000
And of course that made it internationally important.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:44.000
In the end it was discovered that his timber, I think, was a repair done in England or proposed repair on part of the ship.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:54.000
But he found that, you know, bits had been repaired in England, but it took him a long time to get an actual date for the ship,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:02.000
which would seem to have been built in what I call the Basque country in northern Spain.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000
What was the feeling? What was the sense? Was there great excitement?

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Oh yes, yes, there was a lot of excitement. But of course most of the public didn't know.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.000
But the word was getting around and so I was told by a reporter when it did blow, you know,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
that he'd rang up the council and they were saying, well, what boat is this?

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000
You know, they were denying its existence. But in the end the truth came out.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Was there a risk that they could have covered it back over them? Was that the...?

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Well, I think, no, they couldn't even do that because what they would have had to have done was allow them to record sections of the ship,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:49.000
remove a few of the timbers and the rest would have been bulldozed away because it was in the orchestra pit.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000
It was in the way. So we couldn't save it at all.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:08.000
But anyway, the news got out and I was sort of interviewed by the reporter from the South Wales Argus, Mike Buckingham,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:16.000
and he explained to him what was going on because the trust staff weren't allowed to say anything,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
the museum staff weren't allowed to say anything, council wouldn't say anything.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000
But as I was a sort of volunteer in the know, I could actually tell them.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
So, and then... Did you get a lot of flak for that then?

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000
I don't think they were very happy with me, particularly. But there's nothing they could do about it.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:44.000
But it was just too important to pretend it didn't exist and they didn't know what they were doing.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Was there a sense that the people of the city in the area were behind the project?

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Oh yes, because what happened was immediately it got out.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Me, mainly through Charlie Ferris and other people, they set up a meeting and I was asked to talk,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
so I was one of the speakers and they had international speakers coming along, you know.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:19.000
And this was held in the Dolmen Theatre and various things were said.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:26.000
And in the end, it didn't seem to get anywhere. I said, well look, as far as I understand it,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
the archaeology trust, they haven't got any other option,

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:38.000
the contractors will have to move out in so many weeks' time and then the project will be destroyed.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
So then that gelled them. So then it became the Save Our Ship campaign

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
and eventually the Friends of the Newport ship.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:56.000
And they mounted a 24-hour vigil having people tooting their horns and processions.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
And it was one of the most successful, I have some very clever people help me,

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:10.000
the most successful, all of the earliest internet protest campaigns.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.000
And they actually brought down, of course, didn't take much to do that,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:26.000
the local councils' websites and everything else, plus I think they were a shock on to the Welsh Assembly.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:33.000
And we'd get people writing from, or coming in from all over the world, literally,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000
you know, from Australia, from America, obviously a lot from Europe as well,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:47.000
including virtually all the eminent ship archaeologists as well, Margaret Rools of this world, you know,

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.000
and these sort of people. And so the campaign was huge.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
So I think it was obviously very clear to the council they had to do something.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:07.000
So they had a discussion with the Caddw and then with the National Assembly for Wales.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
And they were offered, I think it was about three and a half million pounds,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000
to pay for the excavation of the ship and the eventual display of the ship.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
But they were told they had to have somewhere where they could put it.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000
So a big idea, without consulting any of the archaeologists or museum people,

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:31.000
was they'd build another big pit within the site of the theatre,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
and that would be used for displaying the Newport ship.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:43.000
So anyway, a bit dubious about it when I heard about it, but this is what was proposed.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
And so they then agreed, you know, the campaign was won.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:54.000
The leader of the council, Sir Harry Jones, was seen down there, smiles all around, you know,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000
we are going to take it up. And they had to take it up piece by piece, you know, you couldn't lift it out.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:09.000
And then it was, it had lots of officer help, including British Steel as it was then, you know,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
and then there was a warehouse there when they took the tanks of water down there,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
although they put the timbers down there which had to be kept in water.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Interestingly enough, they had to get water on this site and put in these big tanks in a large empty shed they had there.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
And they got the water out of the local reams.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:40.000
And when we went and then looked at it, it was absolutely infested with small shrimps and stuff like that,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
which was okay, it didn't do too much harm.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
And the timbers are so strong anyway.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:59.000
So in the end they got some goldfish in and somebody managed to get a baby sturgeon,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000
which over the years I saw grow to about that, from about that.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:14.000
And they left it, you know, selling until everything was washed and cleaned as part of the conservation process.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Then there was a huge wrangle because the director of the trust had told them

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
and he hoped to get the ship out in about six weeks, which was clearly impossible.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
It took about six months.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:39.000
So, I mean, without going into too many details, they said, okay, you go ahead and have the six months.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
They weren't very happy about it.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
They being the council?

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
The council, yes.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
But it went ahead and it was successful.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.000
I mean, in actual fact, it was very quick.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:01.000
You know, if you think of another site as big as that, you could be there for years.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
But they did it in about six months, cut it out.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
How many, what were the numbers of the people working there?

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000
They varied from 30 to 40 at the most, but they varied.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
And they had specialists came in as well, like Nigel and others.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000
So, I used to go along and annoy them because I was allowed to go in and photograph them,

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
which they were grateful for afterwards because when they were reassembling it,

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
I'd taken photographs of timbers which had been misplaced so they could work out where they went.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
So that was all right.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
But it was a long job.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000
But I was really there on a supporting level.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.000
I wasn't really taking part in the excavation or the recording or the conservation process,

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000
which were all sort of, you know, breaking new ground all the time, particularly in the recording.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Conservation had been done before, but this was new techniques coming in as well.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Unlike the Mary Rose, for instance, this preserved much better and quicker

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.000
because of course it was all in bits and you could treat all the timbers individually.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
And the fines kept coming up.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
And so I got involved in looking at the fines as well.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:26.000
But of course nobody knew exactly what the ship was.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
It was assumed it was a British ship.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Most of them traded from Bristol, but it was a vast one.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Probably thought at that time to be about 300 tonnes or could carry about 300 tonnes.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:49.000
They found barrel remains and everything else, including marks of merchants and so I was delving into them.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:56.000
But there were a lot of the timbers there were obviously for rebuilding the ship

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:03.000
because they had been badly damaged and massive timbers, and that's the ones that Nigel managed to date.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000
So I was having a think.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:15.000
I was thinking, well, who on earth could afford to either repair or build a ship of this size?

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:22.000
So thanks to Newport, they gave me a bit of money to do some research.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:30.000
And so I went around researching various places and I did a lot on Medieval Newport, which I found out for the first time.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.000
One of the things I discovered was that at the time the Newport ship was in Newport.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:43.000
It had been towed in there because it certainly didn't seem to be a Newport ship as such.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
It was right in the middle of the Walls of the Roses.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:56.000
And at that time the man we all call Warwick the Kingmaker had actually succeeded in capturing Newport

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:05.000
as part of territories of the then Earl or the late Earl of Pembrokes, as he soon became, mooting his head.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
But it was all taken over by Warwick.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:17.000
And by looking through the archives, particularly in Warwick themselves and elsewhere,

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:29.000
we were able to find out quite a lot of information, including the fact that somebody was paid to bring the ship to Newport,

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:37.000
a ship to Newport at that time, and other people were paid to repair the ship at Newport.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.000
And it was a similar size and it was in 1469, which is spot on the date.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:51.000
So with a lot of arguing, it didn't prove anything, according to some, but I think the experts as a whole realised

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
there was nothing else they could compare it to.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:04.000
So I'm pretty certain, you can never say never, but 99.9% certain that the references were relating to Newport ships.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.000
So I was able to bring in this royal connection and the Walls of the Roses connection, which is what you'd expect.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:17.000
And this led to all sorts of other discoveries of the historical nature in particular.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
So that was my contribution, if you like.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Would you describe the Newport ship as the jewel in your crane, or are there other things that you would consider?

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Micro? Well, it's certainly the biggest individual item I've ever had to deal with, if you don't count buildings.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:51.000
But I've been on sites all over the place. I was up on Hadrian's Wall, down in the Pyrenees,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:36:00.000
involved in the fishbowl on Roman Palace excavations, and I've discovered lots of different things in my different jobs

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:13.000
just by going out and looking. But it was interesting with this, because by using a location where the ship was found,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:20.000
I was able to prove, really for the first time, that we knew that Newport was a walled town.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:28.000
And so that was another project which went from there, and I don't want to prove where the original Merringer's House was,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:34.000
and what the layout was, and so on and so forth. So I became Mr. Medieval Newport, very much so.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:46.000
But even the eminent archaeologists had to, or historians at that point, had to agree and be fair. They got tremendous backing.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Professionally, not just the ship, but all those other finds along the estuary, it must be an incredibly rich period to be working in.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:08.000
It is, but there are two things. One is that if you drop something in mud, it gradually becomes anaerobic, there's no air in there, it gets preserved.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:19.000
For instance, at Caldecott, they're even finding ladybirds mixed up with it, with, you know, the kiln still red with a bit of black spots on.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:33.000
When we were digging out the trackway, which we call the Upton Trackway, that had leaves, twigs and very fine material, because it was buried and it wasn't disturbed.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:47.000
And nobody knew it was there, and there it remained until you got one of these really fierce storms, which could happen thousands of years later, which exposed it.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
So what was the Upton Trackway? What was that?

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Well, that was our first trackway we discovered with Derek Upton. We called it the Upton Trackway because it was after him.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Near Sudbrook, was that in the estuary?

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:07.000
It was near Chapel Tunk, where the other side was. It was near Magor Pill. That was one of the first things we discovered.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:16.000
So, you know, and all the miscellaneous stuff, yes, it was incredibly rich. There are all sorts of other fascinating things.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:38.000
For instance, there's an area which goes all the way along the side of the Wendt Noot levels. We were looking elsewhere as well, but along the Wendt Noot level, you could go and you could pick up sort of spitfire shells, you know, using it as a firing range for practicing spitfires.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000
In fact, there was a spitfire that was buried there, and Derek helped to dig out.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:52.000
In the same area, you could find sort of 19th century lead shot. So they're using it as a firing range there.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:06.000
From the prehistoric period, we were finding things like arrowheads. So, you know, it's sort of the same purpose, being there, even though the conditions in the land, you know, the sea levels have gone up and down.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Sometimes it's been wooded, sometimes the floods have come in and compressed it and the peat, and so it all became mudflaps again. So there's a whole series of dynamics going on there.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:26.000
And it's a massively complicated area and lots of people looking at that sort of side of it.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:34.000
You said that you found, out there in the estuary, you found ancient putters and ranks?

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Yep. Yes, I'll have to go up to the den and dig out some of the photographs just to show you.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000
But yes, a lot of them are obviously now recorded.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:40:00.000
I must have seven levels of research committees set up, which I no longer are involved in because I'm sort of retired too far now to get back into that side of it.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:08.000
And lots of these discoveries are published in there and published in different magazines.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:15.000
And lots were in the papers. And a selection you can see obviously still in the museum in Newport.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000
But that's only a tiny tip of the iceberg to what was discovered.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:29.000
And they were... Sorry, sorry. Oh, sorry. I was just going to ask, because of course you've had very deep involvement in Newport heritage for quite a long time.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:41.000
Prior to the Newport ship discovery, did you detect that there was a sort of long-term build-up of frustration with the council's approach to heritage, or was it a very sudden thing in 2002?

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:52.000
Well, that was that specific point. To be fair to the council, when I arrived in 1983 they'd just built a new museum, well, they'd built a new museum.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:02.000
They were in the process of wanting it updated and improved. And I got tremendous support.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:09.000
And of course they did the same thing with Traditia House. I mean, they took on that when it was in danger of being demolished.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:17.000
And now with the National Trust, of course. There was some money around. So I wouldn't say that was the case at all.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:34.000
There could be a bit, on the planning side, there could be a bit bad, in a sense that they didn't seem to realise that a lot of the historic buildings they had in the town, which disappeared.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:45.000
And basically anything that could bring a job took precedence over any of the cultural side. But that was a planning issue really.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Not supporting the actual facilities which we had was different.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:42:00.000
And that attitude obviously has changed over the years. And now there's very strict planning guidance terms.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:11.000
And they've got a very good team, or did have, when they had people looking at planning matters and so on.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:20.000
So I don't see that as a particular problem. But no, there was no problems at all until this bloody boat came up.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Oh well, I have to delete bloody. Because that was holding up another key project.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:40.000
And so when it came to the Arts Centre or Arts Theatre, all this dubious yet another boat, there was no question there,

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.000
and mine's just keep quiet about it and get it out of the way as quickly as possible. And they failed.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000
You stuck your neck out there in the bit really, didn't you?

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Well, I had, they couldn't, in fact, when I got my pension they couldn't do anything about that.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:06.000
But what they did do, and that was about that time, was that when the Royal Gwent Archaeological Trust,

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:15.000
who hadn't been involved in saying anything about it, finished their contract, they said, right, we're not going to pay you.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000
They said, you've said six weeks, ten six months, you know, we're not paying you after the six weeks.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000
This was despite the fact that they'd never said anything about that before.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000
They'd been monitoring all their records, including how much they were paying staff and the rest of it.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:37.000
And it nearly brought the Trust down. So I was very involved in that.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:44.000
In fact, I've still got the papers, although the more sensitive ones I put in the embargo on and sent to the Gwent Archives.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:50.000
But, you know, it was a very nasty business and it was a, you know, it went on for ages.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:56.000
And fortunately, all those involved in it have now gone.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:02.000
And it didn't help them anyway because they'd been told by their conservator, Kate Hunter,

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.000
that the gallery they were putting in and it would not fit the ship.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
The experts had come along and said it wouldn't fit the ship.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Staff at the museum elsewhere were told under threat of losing their jobs and discipline.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:25.000
If they said anything other than the party line, that they were for the chop.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
But we knew it wouldn't work.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:34.000
And it was only after most of these people had seen the writing on the wall and left.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:48.000
I won't mention any names, but they appointed a new guy who was then a sort of museum services manager.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:45:00.000
That's Mike Lewis, who is still there and has gone through hell of a way, you know, with all the cut packs and everything else.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:06.000
But he's kept the project going and he backed the conservator and backed the other people.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000
And he convinced, not in that but he convinced the council that they were right.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000
What they were told was wrong.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000
I remember going to a meeting much later on and there were some councillors there.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Some of them would just glare at me.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000
And it was a political, you see.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:34.000
And one of them, a sweet old guy, said, will our ship fit in that basement?

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000
And I said, well, some of it would.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
I'm trying to be diplomatic.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:46.000
But the message got out because obviously they'd heard it at sort of highest possible levels.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
But they just wouldn't take advice.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
And they paid the price.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Well, we paid the price and they've just gone on and elsewhere.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
But anyway, there's been total change around in regime.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Support is there.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
And the big problem these days is austerity.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
There's support for the project.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000
The support is there.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
But they've got to get money to do it.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Do you generally think the outlook for the ship is quite good at the moment?

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000
I think so.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Whether it will be re-displayed in my lifetime is another matter.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
And last I heard, and I'm not really up to date with it, I'll have to talk to Martin Lewis,

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:38.000
the idea was to sort of put it on the top of the present museum or to that building.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000
Because one of the troubles about having a new museum and new display,

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:47.000
it's not just the cost of putting it in, the capital cost, if you like,

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:52.000
because that can usually be found from lottery heritage or whatever.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000
It's the running costs.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000
But of course if it's part of an existing project, which is why they want it in the front,

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
there are people there.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000
And the building is there.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000
So it's sort of much more economical.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:15.000
But no, I won't, but there were huge problems and very vicious things going on,

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000
which I perhaps better not go into now.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
What was it for Chewitus that you met Derek Upton?

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Very few Chewitus.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.000
Derek just happened to come into the museum when we were wanting material.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000
I said, where did you find it, Derek?

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000
And so he took us out there.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:39.000
And from then on, he'd been telling people about what he'd been finding for years,

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.000
and the odd things which had been taken normally by the National Museum of Dunnely.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:49.000
They'd accepted, you know, bronze spearhead, this sort of thing.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:54.000
But nobody had really wanted to go out with him, you know.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
And we just went everywhere together.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
We became really close friends and went round to his house

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000
and heard all these rambles and recollections.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.000
And he was divorced.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.000
And he had his son Dean living with him.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000
And he said one of the reasons divorce went through was because of his collecting.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:24.000
And including he had found this sort of big cannonball,

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:30.000
which he'd brought in and put by the back door as a store stop.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:35.000
And thought nothing about it until he started weeping something out of it.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.000
And eventually, somehow, somebody in the know said,

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000
well, I think you should get the bomb squad in there.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
They did. And it had been full of nitroglycerin.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
So maybe she had a point.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000
But he collected all this stuff.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000
He had, you know, masses of it he gave to us.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000
Very generous with it.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000
But he wasn't an archaeologist. He was just an enthusiast.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Well, he was out there. You know, he lived his life there.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000
And he worked in a steelworks one time.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000
But what he was, was he was the honorary warden for the Seven Estuary

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:16.000
for the Gwent Wildlife Trust, which incidentally I went on to be the deputy general as well.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:23.000
And so he was involved in Magelmarsh and all these projects and in the Seven Estuary.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000
So he became Mr. Seven Estuary and knew a lot about it.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000
And of course, in the course of that, he got into the archaeology.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.000
And I think the natural historians and the ecologists were a bit worried

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.000
that he was going to sort of give up all that side of it and do it.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000
But of course, they're so interrelated that it was just marvelous.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:52.000
And much later on, I was invited by the Gwent Wildlife Trust to do a survey

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:58.000
from the historical archaeological point of I think 14 of their sites, including Magelmarsh.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.000
So that, you know, I found a lot more information that way.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000
That was after I retired from the museum.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:14.000
So were the reams, you know, a rich source of archaeology?

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.000
Yes.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000
Did anything emerge from them though?

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Yes, lots of stuff.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Again, it's a matter of finding it.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000
You know, if it's in the ground, how do you know it's there?

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Well, of course, when Gwent Euro Park went in near, what's her name, the hill there,

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:39.000
near Magor anyway, that's when the Balmonds Farm boat came up.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:47.000
But a bit further on, they found huge pits and remains of a hard-aged settlement there.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.000
There had been obviously monastic settlements on there.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.000
A lot of people got very interested in the training of the levels and the sea walls

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.000
and lots of arguments even today on the dating of things.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000
And so there was a lot of training going on.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Certainly on the Ramblin levels, which is the other side of Newport,

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:15.000
the University of Reading got very actively involved in doing sedimentology.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000
And their archaeologists discovered a whole series of reams

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:24.000
which went beyond the sea wall into the floodplain,

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000
well the floodplain onto the Intertidal area.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.000
And these were Roman, you know, so the Romans had been doing it.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.000
So it's a hugely complicated area.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Masses and masses of reports.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:44.000
I hesitate to take you upstairs because where all my working notes are and everything

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.000
because it's in a mess, but I can show you up there if you want.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.000
And you can see the stuff I've got.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.000
So before you came here, Bob, where had you been?

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:03.000
I mean, because it's massively interesting, unusual landscape, isn't it?

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000
You know, with the water drainage and the reams.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000
Was that a surprise? Was that a bonus?

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000
Well, I knew the levels were here.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Because I was actually for nine years before that,

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.000
I was curator at Kingsley Museum, which is on the edge of the Fens.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.000
So we were involved in the archaeology there.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.000
Didn't find King John's treasure, but we found lots of other stuff.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000
And there was a massive amount of stuff that came out there.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:33.000
And also industrial archaeology with the draining of the Fens and so on.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:38.000
So the levels was, you know, it's like repeating myself in many ways.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:44.000
So that's where my interest in it started.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000
I had a good idea of what was going on here.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:53.000
You mentioned that you filmed or took photographs of the last Putra rank at Gold Coast, is that right?

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000
Yeah.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000
When was that?

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:03.000
I did it on slides. So I'll have to look at the slides.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:07.000
Is that because you knew it was coming to an end and they had to be recorded?

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.000
No, just because it was interesting. I didn't know it was going to end then.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.000
But it ended soon afterwards. Just a nice picture.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000
I took lots of them.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:26.000
I got a lovely one, which is about a mile out in Yestery, looking back towards Goldcliff Point.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.000
Just in front of me is a big pool about the size of this room.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:35.000
In the middle was a red Renault 4, half submerged in the water.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000
It looked brand new.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.000
I sort of wondered if there was somebody still in it, but there wasn't.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.000
But you'd find all sorts of stuff dumped by the ships there.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000
What sort of things?

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Well, lots, for instance, to give you an example, around Nash.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000
There are sort of banks going on either side of the usk.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.000
And the ships used to dump everything out of there.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:04.000
I've got a few bits upstairs, but there's a lot in the museum.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.000
I've got things like shipping lines, porcelain.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000
But above all things like clay pipe bowls.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.000
Derek had hundreds of these he'd picked up.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000
I've got four or five upstairs.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Pottery, obviously.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000
Wooden stuff.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:27.000
There's a ship's fender, which we picked up, took back to the museum.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:33.000
Stuff washed out and prehistoric stuff from elsewhere.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000
Everything under the sun you can think of.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:42.000
And it'd all get washed up against the seawall, the high tide marks.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:47.000
So you arrived in the early 80s, and then the dockland area,

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000
was there an active place then?

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.000
Oh, yeah, it had been going.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:57.000
I think the town dock was about 1840, was it?

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Oh, earlier than that, I can't remember.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000
You've snorled this stuff.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000
I'm going to see now.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.000
But anyway, so that's certainly 19th century.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:12.000
So, I mean, Newport was a massive port because of, you know,

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:17.000
it's where the canals and the railways came from, the valleys,

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000
bringing down iron and coal and stuff.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:27.000
You know, it wasn't ever as big as Cardiff, but it was vastly important.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:32.000
And this was the Lord Tridiga or the Morgan family at Tridiga House.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.000
It owned, you know, lots of the land here.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.000
It had what was called the Golden Mile, which was in the railway,

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.000
which went through their land and their estates,

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.000
and every truck they got a payment on.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.000
So they became vastly wealthy.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:56.000
And so they paid for huge amounts of things in Newport, you know,

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.000
rebuilding and so on and so forth.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:07.000
I was just wondering, because the docks are now, you know, by all accounts,

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000
you can't just walk in anymore.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000
No, you can't.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.000
You know, Jan, for example, has got a fantastic interview

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.000
with a woman who was a prostitute there during the war, for example.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
Yeah, the colour.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Down at the Waterloo Arms, no doubt.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:26.000
Well, I just wonder whether, as a curator,

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.000
whether one records what's happening now.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000
I suppose it's probably what we're doing.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:38.000
To a degree, I mean, it depends, because it depends whether you've got the time.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:42.000
I mean, I've been down there quite a number of times.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:46.000
And you can still get on the docks quite easily,

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:51.000
because I took my scrap boiler when they put a new boiler in,

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:55.000
a hot water boiler, a copper one, got 60 quid for it.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:59.000
You know, that was well worth it, you know, I went down there.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:04.000
So, you know, with the flimsy sort of excuses you can get down and see.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.000
Obviously it's not a patch on what it was in its heyday,

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:11.000
but it's still a very active report.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.000
Trinnega House, I should ask you about that, really.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:20.000
So, your time working in Newport, what was your contact with Trinnega?

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000
Well, according to my job description,

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:28.000
I was responsible for overseeing Trinnega House.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.000
And there was a really brilliant guy called David Freeman,

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.000
who knew exactly what he was doing, running it.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:38.000
And I said, no, you do what you want, David, I'll just support you.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.000
And so he did that.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:46.000
But when he left, you know, I went down there and worked for a little while,

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.000
just to help things tick over.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000
Was it open to the public then?

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:55.000
Oh, yes. Yes, but in those days they were guided tours.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:00.000
A lot of the rooms were still empty, they still are.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:07.000
And it was just a long, long business of finding bits of stuff to go in there,

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.000
particularly things which had belonged to the family.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000
And so stuff came in.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:18.000
Sometimes it was bought, sometimes it was on loan, and sometimes it was given.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:22.000
So that process is still going on.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:27.000
The restoration work, again, you know, is always needed, lots doing to it,

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.000
and it still does.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.000
So it's one reason why the National Trust has taken it on,

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:39.000
because council can no longer afford it because of the austerity measures,

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.000
and it saved it, you know.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.000
But if it hadn't been for the early days, particularly David Freeman

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:51.000
and then director Alf Robke and others that supported him,

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:55.000
he wouldn't have survived.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:59.000
And he had great fans as well.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:03.000
Princess Margaret, when she was died, was one of his personal friends,

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:08.000
so she would come down and have tea in his cottage by Tredegar House.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:15.000
So he knew everybody and we might sort of interfere with that,

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:19.000
so I just mainly concentrated on the museum.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.000
So what was his background then? What do you know about him?

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:26.000
David, oh, goodness. I'm not sure about his early history, he's still around.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.000
Is he?

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:34.000
Oh, yes. He was a close friend of...

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:39.000
Who's the fashion designer? Settle Beaton, is it?

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Oh, really?

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:45.000
Yes, very, very. When I say close, I mean close.

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:51.000
And when Settle died, he inherited his house and everything else,

00:59:51.000 --> 01:00:00.000
so he lived there, but he's a really enthusiastic, effervescent sort of character.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
He must be rather ancient, though, surely.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
He's younger than me.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Gosh, he must have been a very young friend of Settle Beaton.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000
He was a young friend. I'll go into that.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Does he still live locally, then?

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Well, he lives...

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Oh, it's out in...

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Oh, wow, I can't remember the name of the place, but it settles Beaton's house,

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:32.000
which is sort of, I don't know, somewhere in Hampshire or somewhere around about there.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
I'm not sure where. He did have a...

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Oh, no, but he still got a flat at Cardiff Bay.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000
And of course, when he was working, he lived in a flat at Trudiga House.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Okay, so it would be interesting to talk to him, maybe.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Oh, definitely.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I don't suppose you have a contact, do you?

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Well, I send him a Christmas card, and then he sends me one the next year,

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
so I then send him one the year afterwards.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000
But somewhere I've got his address.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Yeah, it might be really...

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
But, I mean, Trudiga House wouldn't know where he was.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000
I mean, he's still involved in schemes there, like the...

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:17.000
There's a voluntary scheme for helping people with mental problems in the gardens and so on,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000
and he's been very actively involved in that.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
They're unlikely to give me his number, though, aren't they?

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Mm-hm.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Trudiga House are unlikely to give me his address, I should think.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Well, you may be able to contact him there, but if not, I'll have to just have to dig it out, that's all.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Yeah, I'd be grateful. Thank you.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:42.000
So, just on the levels, so it sounds a bit of a cliché question, really,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:52.000
but is there any find you've discovered that really sticks, apart from the ship, that really, you know, stays with you?

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Well, and the Ballinsfarm boat, of course.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Yeah.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
They were the two major ones.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.000
I think it's just the quantity of stuff, you know.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000
The most exciting moment was the village at...

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:14.000
In Eln Edge Village, which we discovered near Goldcliffe, of Pill,

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:21.000
because he was just going, you're finding one thing, and then there was Derek and myself,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000
and about three or four others, and then there was something else, and then there was something else,

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
and then there was something else, you know, and you knew exactly what it all was,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
and you just couldn't believe it, you know.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000
It must have been overwhelming trying to curate all this.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Well, it was there, you know, and you went back to the foreshore again, and onto the bank, and it all got covered by the sea,

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:54.000
so, but I mean, what happened there was, of course, that Martin Bell, I don't know if you've come across Martin,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000
he came along and said, would you mind if I deal with some of this stuff?

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
No, go ahead, Martin.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
So, you know, he had the proper people and the proper resources went into it,

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.000
and some massive reports came out, and he's still working now.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Yeah, he's on my list of people to interview, actually.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.000
A great guy, and, you know, he did it properly.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Did you ever come across Sir Hampy Tennyson?

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Yes.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
The Pontic Boule estate?

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Yes.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Yes, so did you have, what sort of gene did you have with the Pontic Boule estate?

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Not a huge amount, because I knew him through the Monmouth Surinquarian Society,

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:43.000
and I wasn't really studying his papers as much as going into archives,

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:50.000
and doing that, which I had close, I still have close connections with.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000
And they were tremendous when I was doing my medieval Newport,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.000
because they were finding stuff all over the place and telling me about it, you know.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Wow, actually we've got a meeting, we're going there next Thursday afternoon.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Well, the Moray Guards, particularly Tony Hopkins.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Oh, Tony's at Ebbw Vale?

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Yep.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Yeah, so we're going to the Glamorgan one.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Oh, that's in Swansea, yes.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
So did you know Tony then?

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000
I knew Tony, when he was at the Quintal Cup.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:28.000
He translated a lot of the documents from the Warwick letter and so on for me.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Oh really? Gosh.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:37.000
So he was a great supporter, and I don't think I could have managed it without him actually.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
So is he a Latin scholar then?

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Well, he can read medieval Latin, which I can't.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Well, I try and I get the odd words, you know.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Although the Warwick letter was written in English, but it was still sort of old-fashioned English.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Are there any other characters you've met over the years that you should record?

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Yes, well, unfortunately you can't record Derek.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
No.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Because he's not there. Come in, Tickham, have you come across him?

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
No.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Oh, get him. He was a great friend of Derek's, and he's involved with the, or was involved with the Gwent Wildlife Trust.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000
And I'm sure they would put you straight on to him.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:34.000
And he used to go around giving lectures, and they used to have this, the groupies that go around.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:44.000
He found stuff for us, and he set up a reserve at, what's it called, Brockweir, or somewhere.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Anyway, it's actually not far again from Magor, the village of Magor, and it's now a trust reserve.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:00.000
And it was his family's farm, and he knows a huge amount.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:07.000
I mean, he concentrates on the natural history, but also living there.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
So that's what the reserve is at Magor?

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Not the Magor Marsh Reserve, the Brockwell Farm, which is another reserve in the area.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:26.000
I'm going to have to take you upstairs, I'm going to have to apologise in advance, because the working area is up there.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Oh, don't worry, that would be fantastic. Shall I turn this off?

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Yeah, you can do that.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000
That was fascinating. Thank you so much. Thank you so much.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I was just wondering if over the years you've had much involvement also with the transporter bridge?

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Off and on, off and on. It didn't used to be part of the museum collections, now Mike has got it as part of the museum collections.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:59.000
But I had to do, I had to write some articles for it and do a bit of research in it.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.000
And of course the Newport Schiff staff were involved.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Apart from doing historical stuff, my biggest contribution regarding the Newport transporter bridge was when I arrived and I wanted a display put in about it.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:27.000
And I had a contact, Derek, no not Derek, anyway, a guy who made models.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:40.000
And I got in touch with him and he did almost as a labour of love the model that's in the Newport Museum now, which was then working, so you could, I think we go back, and that's a fantastic model.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
So I was responsible for that coming.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Did you ever use it? Did you ever use the bridge?

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Oh yes, which model or the real one?

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
The real one.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Oh yes, well yes, I've been across it on foot and on car and over the top and everywhere, yes of course.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Did you ever hang beneath it? I've spoken to a couple of people who used to hang beneath it and then drop off.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
No, it never really appealed to me.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I thought, knowing me, I'd probably hang down and jump straight into the gondola or something.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
But no, it's a rather silly idea.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Yes.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:28.000
I think people commit suicide that way, on the Seven Bridge they did the same.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Have you ever found any bodies in the peat?

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Yes.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Yes?

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Yes, lots of skulls and stuff like that.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:48.000
In fact I've had a very long argument with, not sure if nailing, well not argument at all, but discussion I should think would be a better way of putting it.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Because when the Newport ship was excavated, where the struts supporting the ship were, beneath that they found a skeleton, a headless skeleton.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:08.000
And immediately people were talking about it being sacrifices and everything else.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:18.000
But it predated the ship, in fact turned out to be iron age, or everything seems to be iron age.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:33.000
And the people who were writing the report were talking about it being headless because of the head was sacrificed separately.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Well they didn't have Derek Upton's experience, nor him talking with the police, which I listened to.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:52.000
And all the time you find bodies of people which have drowned in the usk or in the cell, happens frequently.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000
I can come in to some nice gruesome stories now.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:12.000
But anyway, basically what tends to happen is somebody either dies or commits suicide or falls overboard, their body floats and it will float up with the tide, which is a massive tide, and then out again.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
So it will go in and out.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Now the weakest point in the body is in the neck.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
So the necks tend to come away and the heads go off.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:32.000
So if you then find a headless body alongside the bank, you can assume that it's not necessarily a human sacrifice or anything like that.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:40.000
There are other things, at least Derek's stories rather than me, because he used to tell them all to me.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:49.000
There was one case just on the other side, on the Bristol side, but he was trying to cross over at low tide.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:59.000
And he came across a pair of boots which were upright like this, with human bones sticking in their head.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Someone had got stuck in the mud.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Oh my goodness!

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
So I then went on to...

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
I mean that's almost comical but tragic.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000
I know, yes.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.000
And then I went on, you know, because most people get trapped because of quicksands out there and everything.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
And the mud is thick, you know.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.000
The number of parties we've taken out there, they've lost their wellies.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
I mean I did it, but then we get blasey about it.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:33.000
We take the students out there and they're all stuck and we're just sort of walking around because we know how to walk in the mud.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.000
And so they're always coming back covered in mud.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000
We used to be washed down in the house when we came back because we were so bad.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
But I said to Derek, I said, well, did you ever get stuck there?

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
And he said, oh yes, once I did.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
He decided he'd walk out to Denny Island.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000
So he went at the very lowest tide possible.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:59.000
But there's a channel between Denny Island and us and he just couldn't get through the channel.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
So he didn't get that way to Denny Island.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:09.000
So he started walking back and he got stuck in some mud and he couldn't get out.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
So he was lying flat on his face.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000
So I looked at him and said, well, Derek, why are you still here today then?

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000
He said, well, when the tide came in, it sucks me out.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
And I swam in with the tide.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Wow.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000
A number of people have tried that and it hasn't worked.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:35.000
So it's really tragic in a sense, the way he died in the end, which I won't go into.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
No.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000
What other stories did he tell you, this adventures out in the estuary?

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Oh, well, I mean, Spitfire was quite a good one.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000
They knew of Spitfire, so he helped to dig it out.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
They come to me and I go.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Some of the unusual stuff he's found.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.000
There was one occasion when I went out with him and another friend of mine called Roger James and his wife.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Roger is, well, he was, probably still is, the president of the Wild Life Trust, whatever the title is.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000
A very nice guy and very knowledgeable.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000
But he found this enormous long bow.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Oh, he found this about this long.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:34.000
And so I was there with Derek and Cindy, who was his friend, and Roger.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:40.000
We wandered along and we said, well, we'll have to take this back because it could be a sort of giant aurochs.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:46.000
So Roger had to carry this thing, bloody thing, miles back over the mud to the bank.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
So we got it there.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000
And so we got back to the museum and actually got an identification done on it.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
It was a giraffe leg bone.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Giraffe leg bone.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000
So it's amazing what you find out there.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
So, yeah, it's really weird.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.000
But yeah, lots of stories about Derek, I mean, of him wandering out there and discovering things.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:20.000
But I think it was getting his knowledge out there.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:27.000
And it came to the point, you know, when I certainly wasn't sidelined, but I left them to it.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
He would talk to Martin Bell, for instance.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.000
None of them would go out without Derek because Derek knew so much.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000
And they would say, listen, he wasn't a trained archaeologist or an academic.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
He would just say, no, that could hurt.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.000
And so they'd all sort of think again about what they'd been pronunciating.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
And he was right.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.000
And I think he got an honorary doctorate given to him in university.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:00.000
But he was sort of modest and assuming.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000
But he did like taking young ladies out there.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:12.000
And as I said, sort of, you know, he would take groups out there and quite often they would get stuck.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000
He would have to help them out again.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:21.000
But he'd take me back to his house and he lived there with his son Dean.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.000
And he collected crassulas in a little plant.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000
So he had them. But the house was just a mass of stuff.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
He discovered bottles, you know.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.000
A lot of these early bottles were quite valuable, you know.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Just as an aside, did the Museum and Art Gallery ever have anything to do with the School of Documentary Photography?

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000
David Hearn?

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Oh, yes. Yes.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Mainly through Ron McCormack.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Yeah.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
If you come across Ron.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000
No.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Well, he used to be head of the Documentary Photography thing.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:02.000
And when I arrived there, he was in the eighties and he's long retired.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000
And each year they had what they call the Newport Survey.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.000
And the Museum would commission them.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Students go out and they did all sorts of different subjects.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.000
I haven't got any here, I don't think, but I've had them in the Museum and the Library.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
And they had two different themes.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000
It might be still working, sort of life down in pill or whatever it was.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000
And each student would take a different theme.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.000
And they were put together and they would produce a book.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
And this went on for about 12 years.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:39.000
In those days we had some money, so we were able to help fund it as well.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
So there's copies at the Museum, do you think?

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Oh, yes.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Oh, gosh, I didn't, yeah.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Yeah, the whole thing is still there.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
I haven't got any copies at all, I don't know why.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.000
But it's well worth looking at.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Because that School of Photography was sort of internationally well known.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Phenomenal.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000
It's a great tragedy when they're closing university here.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:09.000
I saw David Herden about a fortnight ago talking to me about when he's petted up.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:14.000
He was living in a camper van by the lighthouse the first year of that.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Which I thought was quite extraordinary.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
And just go back to the Spitfire, was it shot down over St. Broads?

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Well, it crashed there.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
It crashed, sorry, not shot down.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000
They've been in Germany, it might have been, but it might have been shot down, I don't know.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Was the pilot ever identified?

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Yeah, I think so, I think it was known about.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000
It wasn't one I was directly involved in, so I can't give you the details.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:41.000
So were there other things from the Second World War?

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
And I was talking to a lady last week.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:49.000
A parachute had come down, and they took the parachute.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:56.000
She made an Italian POW, who happened to be a tailor, made her a silk blouse.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
She kept it for years and years and years.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
I just wonder if there's any other things that came from it.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Oh, there's lots.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000
We talk about the prisoners of war, for instance.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Down at Underwood there was a prisoner of war camp there.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
And lots of prisoners were kept there.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:18.000
And some of them actually came out and worked on farms here.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:25.000
There are lots of evidence, you know, from pill boxes to little platforms for anti-aircraft guns all the way around Newport.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:30.000
And Jan could tell you a lot more about it than I could.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:39.000
So there's lots of evidence and some bombing, but got off lightly compared to Swansea or places like that.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Well, I'm going to turn this off now, Bob.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Thank you. I'm sure we could talk all day.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Thank you so much. That was absolutely fascinating.
