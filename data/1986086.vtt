Manith TÃ»r by Gillian Brownson

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Blasted from my side a stone child breaks the water like a finger of fossils in the flood,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
holding back trouble, sea serpents and storms, cradled and battered in the mussels and the mud.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And horizon beyond, my great Wicklow sisters fasten to the crag of their land,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
freeing the rain, falling on sails, driving through and stabbing in the sand.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Still they say goodbye, mortaithiae,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
those the wonder, waving from the whirl of the water in the strum of the salt-green sea,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
hauled in from island, the waves curling, hurling them home to me.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
In a forest of masts, then of funnels, fishermen and, flying into morning,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
past the anchored sun, floating the light of the sky and the sailors warning,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
they sail by at gossai.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Tiny as darting stars they come, twinkling under oil and flame,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
running on decks, hoisting up sails, cracking bottles against their boats name.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
For centuries creaking through the murks of fogs over the toll of the boats wanes whistle,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
washing over shipwrecked rocks, up here among gorse and heather and thistle,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I see Dumma V.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The messengers come rowing, the tugs towing, the scrolls of the captain's log,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
or a missive of love, the treatise of kings from the pen of an old sea dog.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And some are shadows, below in the bones of ships,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
dark words in an ancient hold, the letters bold,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
deep for the divers, float there not read and not told.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The water at war, but the nunnae gov'yor,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I heard guns, not a foghorn, one morn,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
the day's face in the cloud of a frown, the speed of a torpedo,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
the crash of the hull, it came and it sang, blow the man down.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And an engine failed in my sky, in my eye, the jigs up went down to the deep.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Now I flower for them and the many laying here,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and soothe them in death's lonely sleep.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
But above, the boats in the wind,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
le da chi'n mynd? Tracing a track on the back of a monster,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
a life anew for you? Dancing the jig to the horns of ships,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
a scoused terrace with a different view?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Nei, aros yng Ngymru, odan ar awyr halen,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
agwilywch yllonga gyda fi, ma eich mordaeth wedi bod yn hir,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
naw linga hir, an meld to the sea.
