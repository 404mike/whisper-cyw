00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The first to know when in the world of the rain,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Of heaven, bed, and earth, I did away,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And first to know when in the world of the rain.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000
O Deo, in Deo, in the heavenly light,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Not merely a whole, let it come from the sunless sky.
