00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.280
A massive marble clock and a silver coffee service, which was beautifully engraved.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.520
Songs and recitations followed, and the pastor in his opening address referred to the highest

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.320
theme in which these two young people were regarded, and what was given them by the

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:39.720
church was but a small recognition of their valuable service.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:47.080
Addresses followed by other church members, and Mr. and Mrs. Hughes received the gifts

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:35.080
wonderful filling and

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.920
So Donna Sackie Moody, and all that.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.520
When the Roll is called up yonder,

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.320
and kind of like that, kind of like that.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.320
There's one type of it, that's called John Hughes.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:11.720
And in the year 1919, on the fifth of May,

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:17.920
in the time of the great commander of the British Navy,

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.760
on the night John Hughes was killed,

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.240
and they didn't do that,

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.560
I'm sure, I don't know if the historians would have done that,

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.560
but they would have been careful in the country

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.480
where there were many, many victims.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.560
And I was able, sure,

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:43.520
to get to the bottom of it,

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.240
and see the remains of John Hughes

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.200
from the Ponte Pry.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.880
And that's the story.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.480
And the most important part of the story is that of Ponte Pry,

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.680
which includes Salem, Llanelli,

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.320
Tabor, Llantersant,

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.720
Penewal, Pentirk,

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.280
Salem, Gwelydygarth,

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.040
Bethlehem, Rydvelling,

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.160
Dibynestri Forest,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.760
Tabernacle Ponte Pry,

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.400
Jobeath, Kilfynnyrd,

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.720
Nazareth Abercynod,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.000
Northam, Issybwr,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.200
Cappelrondha,

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.120
and Bethesda Trehaford,

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.800
they all died of the death of a great man,

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.720
of a great man,

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.800
was that important?

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.600
of a great man and a great man.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.840
The story has been of great importance in Salem,

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.160
as a reference,

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.720
as a reference,

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.120
in the Sabbath school,

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.360
as a reference to the Church,

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.440
and the Holy Trinity,

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.600
and as a symbol, a symbol,

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.400
I give you good news from all,

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.160
and from the truth itself.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.880
But did you not see your use of Salem?

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.440
So great is your understanding,

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.560
as a source of inspiration,

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.000
a book,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.240
a book, sorry, a book,

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.400
which enclosesUNT,

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.760
which enhance the wisdom

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.840
which nice needs one's part?

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.560
And how important is this understanding

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.240
in its every part,

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.160
how wide you have become

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.300
where you still need to reach for

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.540
the Curела protectors?

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.700
All of the great text

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.080
is the work of Amen.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.520
Our primary focus

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.160
is our primary focus

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.080
and nothing else but to

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:40.640
The Le excellency has 누�ered faintly you for plans and suggestions

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.700
which have been tolerated,

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.420
and have worked with you in the rear gross fields.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.040
then the oversights the томуiedzieć

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.020
What an easy NOT to learn from

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.720
These are the rules that have been for generations now

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.140
ams the vision

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.620
you have二

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:07.620
I want to go now to the big one, the one without the letter.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:13.620
And now, the words of John Hughes' poem.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:20.620
Here are the words. In the Joptings, I think,

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:26.620
In the year 1907, September, he was late coming home from work there,

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:31.620
and told me he had been waylaid by his friend D.W. Thomas,

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:39.620
conductor of Rondra Chapel, who wanted him to compose a hymn to for his Christmas festival.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:43.400
You see, this is the

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:50.400
literary note from the period of the Welsh, and they don't know what it means in the 16th century.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:55.620
There are many of John Hughes' poems in the 16th century, so it shows how

00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:00.620
frivolous it was in the 20th century,

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:04.620
that the 16th century had been a time of

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.400
joy and joy, and then the

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.620
contrast between Rondra and the rest of the world.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.620
My husband had to wait for inspiration before composing.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.620
Some weeks had passed when he went to a service on Sunday morning,

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:24.620
and when he came home, I said, I think I have it.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:29.620
He started on the melody, and did not go to Sunday school,

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:35.620
as was his custom, all the evening meetings that worked on the melody.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.620
By that night, it was completed.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.620
He took it with him on Monday morning, and gave it to Mr. Thomas.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:46.620
He tried it over, Mr. Thomas' son playing the piano.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:52.620
It was completed and named Rondra, after the chapel for which it is composed,

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.620
and the chapel as the first of the world's thousands,

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:59.620
and the same chapel on the other side of the world.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.620
After several years, Harry Evans,

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.620
presenter of the Church of New World in Liverpool,

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:09.620
back in the 19th century, of course, was Harry Evans's great

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:13.620
and great-grandfather, who was the new King of England,

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:17.620
because he was the first to give the name Rondra.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.620
Do you remember the name?

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:29.620
The name was John J. Herbert.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.620
When I was in the 19th century, I read a lot of books.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.620
I read a lot of books, but I was not very good at reading.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.620
I was not good at reading.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.620
My mother would not let me read.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.620
I would not be able to read.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.620
My mother would not let me read.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.620
I was not good at reading.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.620
I would not be able to read.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.620
I read a lot of books.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:32.620
and the property of the Dallas United College.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.620
John Hughes,

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:38.620
John Hughes,

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.620
John Hughes,

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.620
John Hughes,

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.620
John Hughes,

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.620
John Hughes,

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:56.620
the property of the Dallas United College.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:59.620
So, I'm going to cut to that.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.620
John, it's very difficult.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:05.620
But you have to, here's the original.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.620
Here's the original.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.620
Well, in all the other,

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.620
what I did, I did raw testing again, did I?

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:32.620
P4, P4, C5.

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.620
I will be doing natural agorog,

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.620
what I did, another one to the world.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:57.620
And then I went back to the beginning,

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:01.620
and I've learned from all the experts in the company,

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.620
the fact that they have to get to the point,

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.620
it's very often, isn't it?

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:10.620
With the delineation, sequence.

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.620
Get to the point.

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:18.620
What?

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.620
You see, the chords are completely different

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:41.620
from the two notes and the same note in the beginning.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.620
But every line you see is changing,

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:48.620
is changing, and is reaching a certain point.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:52.620
I was talking to a professor before I was talking to John Hughes,

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.620
he said, not every time you play the note,

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.620
well, not play the note, but this is play the note, isn't it?

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.620
Look at the guitar.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.620
And it's, and in the end, you can change,

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.620
you know, you can change the melody of the keys.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.620
Maybe the melody is like this.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:19.620
You see, that's where the word of the world comes from.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.620
John Hughes said, maybe Alice Brown will sing that,

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.620
and that's new, and the tenor can sing...

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.620
So maybe that's the reason why it's new,

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:35.620
because I've heard many different versions of this song.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.620
But that's the main thing.

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.620
The chords are the same.

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.620
Well, the songs are different,

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.620
in the way that Ray Hopkins sang them,

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:09.620
that was in the end,

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.620
that was in the end,

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.620
and he kept singing and singing and singing,

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.620
and he kept singing,

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.620
like the people in Madrid do,

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.620
he kept singing and singing,

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:27.620
but in the end,

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.620
from all over the world,

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:34.620
from all over the world,

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.620
like the world of the green cities,

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:39.620
in the West,

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.620
if the world of the green cities

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.620
allows the world, allows the memories

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.620
of everyone who knows or shares us

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.620
in the West.

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.620
In the West.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.620
But, you know,

00:19:55.620 --> 00:20:02.620
it's a pity that the song has been a national song,

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:04.620
and a popular song today,

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:08.620
but it's a pity for the West.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.620
For the West, as you know,

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:17.620
the song is from a very particular era,

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.620
from the times of Louis,

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.620
and others,

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:21.620
like Bebe Ewing,

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:22.620
Gwaeli Wynne,

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.620
and Peter Williams,

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.620
and then,

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.620
and also,

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.620
Gaid Ni'Odh,

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:30.620
and Greg Seyhove,

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.620
and Pilgrim Sabed,

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.620
and the song has been

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.620
a big hit

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.620
by the West.

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.620
You can think of it,

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:43.620
you can think of it,

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:46.620
and you can put it together.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.620
There's a number,

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.620
there's not only a single sound

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.620
in the works that people

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:53.620
use the song for.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.620
There's a sound that's being sung

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:56.620
in the West,

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.620
in the young world,

00:20:58.620 --> 00:20:59.620
with it.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.620
There's a sound that's being sung

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.620
in longer은',

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:04.620
where the main word

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:05.760
ends with

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:12.620
In 1918,

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.620
John Hughes was invited

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:17.620
to go to theensitive

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.620
San Steff soon as he 안녕하세요

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.620
have arrived here

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.620
in Cowergood

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.860
to cut

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:32.860
and in the middle they sing this in the basement of Utah State Prison, Salt Lake City,

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:42.860
on the two floors of the school building.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:51.860
Dewi Elly sings in Montprix for the two hundredth time and says

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:56.860
when they hear John Hesburgh, how do they hear him with the voice of

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.860
Da, da dee, da dee, Cormoran the Wussy.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:03.860
Trevor Wignall, written in the Daily Telegraph,

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.860
and so,

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:13.860
Tablet, Tablet, Tablet.

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:41.860
And also, and also in the summer of 1930,

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:47.860
there were many suggestions to sing and to be recognized by the echo,

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:55.860
the Cymru the South Wales Echo, to include a good song.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:59.860
The boy wrote to the public,

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:03.860
to improve the standard of him singing amongst the congregation

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.860
and as a means of drawing the people back to the churches.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:09.860
And then,

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:15.860
and then,

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:17.860
and then,

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.860
and then,

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:33.860
Nothing but praise is heard in different parts of South Wales

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.860
for the, for the,

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:45.860
for the rupas which was done by the South Wales Echo in organizing the community sing.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:54.860
The fact that so many thousands come with, come with for singing hymns shows that there is something beneficial in getting people together.

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:57.860
And I feel that you hit upon the right course.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.860
I thoroughly enjoy each festival.

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:06.860
You are my best wishes for the success of the Children's Festival on September the 14th.

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:10.860
Usually, the Children's Festivals are a huge success in the Valley.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:13.860
How much more should it be at Cardiff,

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:18.860
which is a city of which all Wales feels proud.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:22.860
John Hughes, noem grom bachach, noem rondda.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.860
There is also a song,

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:32.860
which is a song to enhance the tone of different languages across the world.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:35.860
But it is certainly worth mentioning,

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.860
for the Stelvio Triarchy,

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:40.860
1928.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:44.860
The Cymru column, which is a new one for me too,

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:52.860
in the collection, there is a message to all generations across the world.

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:58.860
I wish everyone to come and celebrate Cymru.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.860
And what is the song? What is the song?

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:10.860
Chwigech gan i'r hyngwm rondda, nes a'ch cobi bron i'r wyll fan,

Chwigech mryd na fi i'n febyg, er pan greu i'n din i'r byd.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:47.860
with the exultant cadences of cwm rondda in full Welsh hwyl.

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:51.860

Fy na'n awta, fi liciwn i sôn.

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.860
Fy na'n awta, fi liciwn i sôn.

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:03.860
I'm going to read the first part of the lodge in Llan Triesan.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:06.860
In Llan Triesan.

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:11.860
And the reason, here's a little bit of a joke about the T.

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:19.860
I'm going to say that there's a description in my 30th book, 1926,

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:23.860
that John Hughes, I have been in contact with,

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:31.860
and I read part of the book in Llan Triesan.

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:34.860
Come on, take it.

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:39.860
And the book was really interesting.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:43.860
And I'm going to read it now to see who's in it.

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:16.860
Now the person, John Hughes,

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.860
he was a young boy, a boy, a boy, a boy, a boy,

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:23.860
and he was a very good reader,

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:27.860
and he wrote a casual stola,

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:32.860
but capable of writing stirring martial music.

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:35.860
Capable of writing stirring music.

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:39.860
He was a poet, and a poet, and a poet,

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:45.860
and he wrote a song for over 10 years and a half.

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.860
And he was a poet, and a poet,

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.860
I'm going to tell you,

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:52.860
he was a very good reader,

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:55.860
and he would come and write his songs in Chicago,

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:57.860
not on John Hughes' cartridge.

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:00.860
So you have to tell John Victor,

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:03.860
in the early days, in the morning,

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:06.860
in the morning and the evening,

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.860
and he would come and write his songs,

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.860
and he would come and write, write, write, write, write,

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.860
and he would come and write.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.860
Well now,

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:20.860
I also found an anthem.

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.860
I have a lot of anthems,

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.860
but unfortunately they are gone.

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:28.860
But I have to say,

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:32.860
when I read the book in the hall,

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:37.860
I found a copy of the only song

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.860
on John Hughes' cartridge.

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:43.860
Thousands of songs.

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:46.860
songs by Evan Hughes,

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.860
songs by David John.

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:53.860
You see, it's not the same as the one I have here.

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.860
Because he wrote this,

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:58.860
he wrote this in the Abbot Tower,

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:01.860
but he wrote this in the picture.

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:03.860
So you see,

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:07.860
I see John Hughes' album and this copy,

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:09.860
and I know that he wrote it,

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:11.860
and I know that he wrote it,

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.860
and I know that he wrote it,

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:16.860
and so it was not the same as the one in the Abbot Tower,

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.860
but the same song,

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.860
but the same song,

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:23.860
a very important musical song,

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.860
and they were not all the same.

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.860
I'll just play a little bit.

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.860
I'll just play a little bit.

00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.860
I'll just play a little bit.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.860
I'll just play a little bit.

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.860
I'll just play a little bit.

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:55.860
And there's a day with John Hughes

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.860
to change some songs

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:03.860
and some old songs

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:05.860
from the old days.

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:07.860
But what he did, you see,

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.860
he was a duet, this was in the past,

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.860
but what he did was...

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:17.860
And I'll tell you,

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.860
I'll tell you...

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.860
He didn't know what he was doing,

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:26.860
he was a duet,

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:28.860
and he was a duet,

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.860
but if he was a duet,

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.860
he was a cute piece.

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:34.860
You see, he was playing there,

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:36.860
just around the corner,

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.860
so he was...

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.860
And here we go.

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:53.860
And then on and on,

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.860
and this is interesting,

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:57.860
this is a novel song.

00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:59.860
But two songs,

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.860
two songs, unfortunately,

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:03.860
there's one song,

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.860
but unfortunately,

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:07.860
we don't have time to sing this song,

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:09.860
because we're going to kill this song,

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.860
and this song is more Welsh,

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:13.860
like, people do something,

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:15.860
people do something.

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.860
Unfortunately,

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:19.860
this song is a bit long,

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:21.860
and the song,

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:23.860
generally, it's important,

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:25.860
what it has is John O.

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.860
John O. Hughes, AC,

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:29.860
on the radio,

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.860
but of course,

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.860
it's a very long song.

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:35.860
And it's not a song,

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:37.860
you have to do things like this.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:39.860
You have to have

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:41.860
songs with different tones,

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.860
but they're not a song,

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:45.860
like this one,

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:47.860
it says,

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:49.860
of course,

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:51.860
I'll praise thee, I'll praise thee.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.260
gerçekten Rückhoff

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:58.980
ascal

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:02.040
mic

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:05.780
But it means something...

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.780
it can be wrote

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:09.780
according to drama,

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:11.780
and drama can be...

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:13.780
appropriate,

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.780
about what one could expect

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:17.780
from a statsane.

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:19.780
Because quote unquote,

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.780
there are big aspects of drama.

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.780
A little thing,

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:55.780
and I am proud of her.

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:57.780
She taught the people of the West,

00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.780
taught the children of the West.

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:01.780
There was no teacher and teacher

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:04.780
and teacher and teacher and teacher.

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:06.780
The teacher is dead in the corner

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:09.780
and the teacher is dead in the world.

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:11.780
But her children and her children

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:13.780
were holy brothers

00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:16.780
for all the world, for all the world.

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:18.780
And what is the voice for all the world?

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:21.780
For all the world is the Holy Spirit.

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.780
I am proud of all of them

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:26.780
and I am proud of all the world

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:28.780
for someone who is more powerful

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:31.780
than me in the world.

00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:34.780
Blenntin Prouder, the great poet, said

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:37.780
I am proud of all of them.

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:40.780
He taught Indian language classes

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:42.780
and in the South Moray,

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:44.780
and he said that there are many

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:46.780
different languages in the world.

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:49.780
He taught them all in a small way.

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:52.780
He taught the world of the West

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:55.780
and the world of the West.

00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:58.780
He taught the world of the West

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:01.780
and the world of the West

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:04.780
for many years.

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:07.780
He taught the world of the West

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.780
for many years.

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.780
But what is the voice for all the world

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.780
on this holy mountain?

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.780
It depends on the person.

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:22.780
For example, the poet

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.780
Glan Avan in the book said

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.780
that this mountain is not fit

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.780
to be a holy mountain in the West.

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.780
He said that the West does not

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:36.780
sound good.

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:39.780
The elder man in the book said

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:42.780
that the mountain is not fit

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:45.780
to be a holy mountain in the West.

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:48.780
The mountain is not fit to be a holy mountain

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:51.780
in the West.

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:54.780
So I understand the words.

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:57.780
But I have another word.

00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:00.780
It is a house.

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:03.780
The house of the great poet

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:06.780
Avinal Ghani in the West.

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:09.780
So, in this book,

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:12.780
I will tell you

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:15.780
that Avinal Ghani,

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:18.780
the great poet,

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:21.780
was not born in the West,

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:24.780
but in the West.

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:27.780
He was born in the West.

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:30.780
I hope you will find it.

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:33.780
I hope you will find it.

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:36.780
I hope you will find it.

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:39.780
I hope you will find it.

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:45.780
And of course, I have to say

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:48.780
goodbye for now.

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:51.780
And thank you for listening.

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:54.780
For listening to this.

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.780
And I will go to the

00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:00.780
end of the session.

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:03.780
Goodbye.

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:06.780
Goodbye.
