Cover by The Thruness

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.620
darling, you are my representative,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.860
all the sounds around my soul were sung.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.160
Father가요

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.260
noi, we almost are out of breath,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.420
but we are safe.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.580
Please stand and we're all singing

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.420
from Dahvel & Bonilla microwave.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:11.420
O liketh the Temple-M protagon orale, to are the Hell-beings!

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.480
But we go through yonder

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.980
English

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:59.720
O little town of Bedford, how still we see thee lie

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:10.460
Above the deep and green last sink the silent stars go by

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:21.140
Yet in the dark streets shineth the everlasting light

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:34.300
The longsands and tears of all our years are met in thee tonight
