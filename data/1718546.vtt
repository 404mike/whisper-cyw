WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
And okay, things were changing all the time.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.520
It was quite busy where we were up

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.560
because where the Forest College house is now

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.400
and things like that,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.920
that was the hub of what Quinceana Forest was doing.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.080
It was all the machinery, they had lorries,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.240
they had vans and things like that.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.520
They had a little field where the house next door

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.880
is built on now.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.720
At the very top of that,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.680
you can see like an old garage shed there at the top.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.080
That used to be the garage for the Forest Commission's lorry

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.400
that they used to carry people

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.680
and the materials around all over the place.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.640
And then down below that, there was a petrol pump.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.120
There was various sheds and things like that

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.960
where they kept all the materials and things.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.200
And eventually they built,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.880
in addition to the office that was next to the house,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.040
they built an office in the field

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.840
where the Chalet house is now.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.880
There's a decent sized office there

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.600
and there was a secretary, I think,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.360
who worked in there as well.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.000
And that's where it was run from.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.400
And below the house,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.440
further down the road towards the Wayland Cottages

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.080
and things like that, there was a field down there.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.600
You don't notice it now because it's all wood.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.320
But there was a field there, which was the nursery.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.800
And there was some sheds down there

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.560
and they had at one stage, initially they didn't

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.680
because they bought seedlings in,

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.240
but they actually, after a while,

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.600
they grew seed beds there.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.240
They were like big raised beds,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.840
great big long raised beds as long as a cricket pitch.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.280
And they grew the trees

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.040
that they were gonna plant from seed there.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.520
So they grew them in the seed bed

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.200
and then the rest of the field all the way down

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.280
was rotivated and made into sections.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.560
And they planted out each of the seedlings

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.040
into the nursery area before,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.600
and they'd been living there for a couple of years

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.200
to get big enough to be able to be planted on the hills.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.360
But the interesting thing was they got,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.360
it was real, I suppose, post-war

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.320
where a lot of people had come out of the army,

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.800
a lot of military guys

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.320
who got very good procedures for doing things.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.760
There was a procedure for doing everything,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.920
but it was in the grocery commission.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.920
They got these designs of A-frames,

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.960
and little frames with a bar across the top

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.680
and an A-frame coming down.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.480
And what they'd do is they'd collect the seeds

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.480
from where they grew the seeds in the beds.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.280
And then they'd split them out

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.560
and they had a special frame

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.640
with a V-shape cut in it like that.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.840
And they'd drop a little seedling in each one of those Vs.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.000
And there was a clamp mechanism that clamped that shut

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.200
and they could hold a whole row of plants up in Longo.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.560
And they'd get away of actually cutting,

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.760
again, everything was measured carefully.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.560
So all the plants were exactly the same distance apart.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.440
And then there was a mechanism on the board as well

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.120
that when they put it down onto the soil,

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.120
that it was the right distance away from the plant,

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.200
the other side.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.200
And very quickly, they could just push all the soil together

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.400
on that, lift the frame out,

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.560
and you'd got a big row,

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.600
a full row of seedlings planted

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.680
without hardly damaging or touching.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.920
Then immediately they'd put it back on,

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.960
they'd do the same thing

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.400
and they'd work their way down the field

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.360
and fill the whole field up with plants

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.520
leaving there for a couple of years

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.520
to be ready to be put out.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.320
And the thing I think that you can lose sight of sometimes

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.360
is that when you look in the forest,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.640
all the way over those hills,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.720
you don't realize that every one of those trees

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.120
was planted by a man with a mattock,

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.800
dug a hole, pulled a chunk of soil forward or clod forward,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.200
put the plant into it,

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.120
clod it his way through under the next one.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.360
And when you look through it,

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.160
it's hard to believe the amount of effort that they took.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.480
Okay, and some of the hill tops up behind the whennest hill

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.560
up behind you there,

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.880
it was wet on the top there.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.320
And what they did there was they'd actually use a big plow

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.280
on a caterpillar and they'd make a long turf

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.640
when they throw the soil over

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.240
and they plant the trees on that.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.560
That was quite interesting.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.640
And we used to go out from,

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.560
when for example, when they were plowing on the top,

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.640
we used to have a ride on the caterpillar with,

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.800
I think it was Reg Hope from his to live in St. Harman,

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.000
he used to drive it.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.040
I know that was a beast in itself.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.000
The caterpillar was, I think some had been regenerated

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.560
from some ex-army engine or something like that.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.240
It was called a Fowler.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.000
And to start it, there was no batteries or anything like that.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.960
It had a little donkey engine,

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.640
that you'd put a cartridge in and you locked it up

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.080
and then you struck the cartridge

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.200
and then you shot a charge into it.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.200
That threw the engine over

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.160
and hopefully would start the engine.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.680
It was a remarkable machine.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.200
I don't know if there are any of those around now,

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.960
but we used to mess around with those.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.680
And when we were young, for example,

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.520
when they, before they planted the trees

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.520
in front on the bottom of the slope coming down there,

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.040
they removed a lot of the oak trees that were there.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.800
And the forest commission guys were split the logs,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.640
they cut them into logs,

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.640
split the logs into with big wedges and sledgehammers

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.000
to make the posts that they'd need to go all the way

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.560
around the perimeter of all the fences

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.240
that the forest commission was putting up around the land

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.840
that they'd either acquired by compulsory purchase

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.400
or normal purchase.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.880
But yeah, it was some, you know,

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.480
quite often we'd be out there.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.480
At the time as well,

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.840
the forest commission were building roads everywhere.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.200
All those roads they put in that you see around,

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.320
most of the original ones are those,

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.040
not the ones that the extractors,

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.960
the people taking timber out were doing.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.920
They just ripped through the soil and made a right mess.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.720
But they put those roads in

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.280
before they put a lot of the trees in.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.720
So they were prepared, everything was prepared.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.160
They needed to have the road infrastructure in there.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.000
They needed to have,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.120
I assume they had to make sure they got the plans.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.840
And so there were teams of people kind of building the roads

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.040
going with graders and caterpillars and things.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.880
And they've quite a lot of work there.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.520
And they'd be blasting through the rocks

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.240
as they were going in front of our house.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.120
And they'd be blowing the whistle

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.520
to tell people to be aware they were just about to blast.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.440
And there were occasions when stones were falling

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.040
in the fields just across the road from us,

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.360
from the top of the hill down.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.200
It was quite an operation.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.040
As well as that, there was a lot of work for people

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.120
during that time.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.280
It seems, I don't know where they came from, all of them.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.560
They weren't all immediately from the Abbey.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.520
They were from where they had a planter door

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.320
and places like that and places around.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.200
But in addition to planting the trees,

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.760
obviously you had to prepare the land.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.680
They were planted in, I think,

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.560
what do they call them, compartments.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.320
I think the trees were planted in a ridge

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.760
and they'd leave a ride or a fire break between them.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.960
And the fire break, somebody would have to plow

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:19.040
the fire break or make that such that it wasn't good

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.760
for a fire to leap across and things.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.280
So there was a lot of work going on.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.560
And then they had to weed the trees.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.840
When they planted them, when they were very small,

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.360
there were teams of people who'd be going around

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.040
spending weeks and weeks and weeks

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.280
kind of weeding sections and things like that

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.880
on the trees that were young.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.040
And once they got up a certain height as well,

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.640
there'd be teams going out to brush them

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.160
where you'd cut the lower branches off

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.280
before you get to the point when it started,

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.480
when they started getting bigger,

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.880
before they get to the stage where they were,

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.400
I suppose, 15, 20 years old,

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.880
where they were starting to take the first thinning.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.280
So there was a lot of effort there.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.240
There must have been 40 plus people

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.200
working for the forestry at that time.
