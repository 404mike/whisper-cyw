WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Thank you, Bron.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.820
At this time we will have some more congregational singing. Benson, will you please come forward?

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.180
When we'll go over the Welsh words with us.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:19.560
Tonabotl, this tune by Thomas J. Williams, is taken from a praise handbook published in 1890

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:26.200
and is also called Ebenezer. Although I think in the Presbyterian hymnal you'll find it as Tonabotl.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.540
The legend claims that the tune was found in a bottle washed up on the Welsh shore.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.720
And like all legends, it's highly suspect.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.800
However,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.800
legends are fun to believe in.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.000
We're going to do the Welsh words before we start singing this time so as not to break up the flow.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.880
An adawroedd mawr ar tonnay.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.320
Nid oes neb a ddail fy mhen.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.320
Ond fy anwyl brior iesu.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.320
Af i farw ar y pryn.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.840
Cyfall iw yn avon angay.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.840
Ddail fy mhen i ywchydon.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.840
Gwlo garno wna i mi ganu.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.840
Yn yr avon ddwfon hon.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.840
We'll sing it in Welsh first and then we'll do the second one in English and we need to stand up. Very good.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.840
Here we go.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.840
An adawroedd mawr ar tonnay.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.840
Nid oes neb a ddail fy mhen.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.840
An adawroedd mawr ar tonnay.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.840
Ond fy anwyl brior iesu.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.840
Af i farw ar y pryn.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.840
Cyfall iw yn avon angay.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.840
Ddail fy mhen i ywchydon.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.840
Gwlo garno wna i mi ganu.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:54.840
Yn yr avon ddwfon hon.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.840
Now in English.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.840
Send our spirit high, we seek thee.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:11.840
Praise the Lord, for our gain.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.840
Send thy comfort low to each tree.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:26.840
Guide me, have me, do my bidding.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.840
Still for wretched I have wandered.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:41.840
Far from seeing thy face.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:49.840
Wretched I have wandered.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:58.840
Lead only me into light.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.840
Thank you.
