00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.040
I'm pleased to reminisce and speak about my relationship with Wales. I'm Dave Stephanie

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.840
Shirley, but in the time that I'm talking about, my name was Vera Buchtal. Nobody could

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:25.040
pronounce it because it was spelled B-U-C-H-T-H-A-L. I came over as an unaccompanied child refugee

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.080
from Nazi Europe and had settled with foster parents in the Midlands of England and with

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:39.080
whom I was very happy. I was doubly lucky because both my birth parents survived, but

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:46.080
sadly I never bonded with them again. That often happens when families are separated.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.080
I was with my older sister. We couldn't bear to let go of each other because it was such

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.120
a major uprooting to come from one country to a new country, different language, different

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:05.120
parents, different food, different everything. It was traumatic. When we got to England,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:12.120
we lived with our foster parents and I started to visit Osmousby where my mother had settled

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:21.120
around about 1942. She had gone to Osmousby partly because it was a border town and she

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:28.160
thought that would help in our assimilation. We knew one other family, the Ryders. There

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:35.160
was no antisemitism in Osmousby. Correction, certainly not as far as I'm concerned. I

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:42.160
was in Osmousby for six years from 1946 to 1951 and it was quite an important time for

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:50.160
me, partly because I needed peace and quiet after the turmoil of leaving Austria and my

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:58.160
parents and Osmousby gave me that. When I got to Osmousby, the unisex school apparently

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.160
announced that two little refugee girls were arriving and that they would be very disturbed

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:13.160
and everyone was to be very nice to us. Certainly that happened. We were not made to feel unwelcome

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.160
at all and I had no idea that the school had been primed for our ingress until years later.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:29.160
I needed those six years of peace in Osmousby to put down roots. I was very conscious that

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.160
Osmousby is politically English but geographically Wales. On market days, the farmers came down

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:47.160
from the hills with their cattle and the whole town spoke Welsh, which I do not. It was a

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:55.160
very warm community. The other link that got us to Wales was my father's story. In 1940,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.160
he was interned as an adult German to New South Wales, Australia and then got the opportunity

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.160
to come out of his internment camp and join the pioneer corps in England. First he was

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.160
in Bicester and then he was put in charge of what became the Mid Wales Psychiatric Hospital

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.160
at Talgarth. So for several years we would occasionally see him at Talgarth. I can remember

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.160
picking bilberries on the Brecon Beacons and really feeling the mountain environment that

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.160
I was accustomed to in Austria. There are lots of things that make Wales very dear to

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.160
me. I can remember my tears of joy when I heard people singing spontaneously on the

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:57.160
trains. Maybe I was going to Talgarth, which would happen very much in continental Europe.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:05.160
And I sung in my school choir at the Iced Steadford in Langlaster one year. Later I was billeted

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:13.160
in Oakhurst, a hospital for girls. It was an old manor house that had been used commercially

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:21.160
by the Coventry Climax Company and is today back in private hands. Osborne Street Town

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:28.160
Council have brought up a blue plaque for me in the centre of the town alongside Wilfred

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:35.160
Owen, one of the great World War I poets. And I'm sponsoring a history of Oakhurst

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:42.160
as a thank you. I had the feeling of this quiet and musical country that valued education.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:53.160
I think that resonated with me even as a child. So there are lots and lots of links with Wales.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:01.160
My sister Renata was four years older than I, so she was nine when we arrived in England,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:08.160
ten plus at Osborne Street. She became infected with the polio virus and was paralysed in

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:15.160
an iron lung at the orthopaedic hospital for ten months. The Park Hall Military Training

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:23.160
Establishment was there. So this small hall, Robert James and Agnes Hunt Hospital had wonderful

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:31.160
facilities and in particular they had penicillin, which was scarce in those days. She managed

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:39.160
to get two doses of penicillin a day for goodness knows how long. It was really rather remarkable

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:47.160
that they should do that for a refugee child. I've been to Osborne Street a couple of times

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:55.160
recently once to unveil the blue plaque when I met some Syrian refugees who'd also been

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:03.160
made to feel welcome. The town is starting to feel proud of its border status, that it

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.160
really can welcome different cultures and find them interesting without having to necessarily

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:17.160
wanting to change them. Osborne Street is especially important to me because unusually

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:27.160
they allowed me to study mathematics, which in those days girls did not do. The only science

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:34.160
thought respectable for girls of that generation was botany, the study of plants. But I wanted

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:42.160
to study maths and I was pretty firm about it. They put me through some psychological

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:49.160
testing and eventually agreed. But my girls' school did not have the capability to teach

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.160
maths at the school certificate level, we called it that then. And so I had to go to

00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:01.160
the boys' school for all my maths lessons. So I was always walking between the two schools,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:08.160
which had different timings. But thankfully somebody, somewhere, had enough sense to realise

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:15.160
that I should study mathematics. I wanted to and I had the capability. And that was

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.160
important to me because I spent my main career in the computer industry, which in the early

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:28.160
days was highly mathematical. So Oxford Street has made my career and I'm very conscious

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:37.160
of that. Starting at 18, I had a vigorous professional career which was thoroughly enjoyable

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:47.160
and now at age 88 I still enjoy work. When I nominally retired at the age of 60, I put

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:55.160
my energies and efforts into philanthropy. I operate as a venture philanthropist, not

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:03.160
just giving money to charities, though I do that as well, but seeing problems, working

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:11.160
out a solution, doing a feasibility study to see if we can make something happen. All

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:19.160
philanthropists, nothing to do with stamps by the way, all philanthropists aim to make

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:26.160
the world a fairer place. I suppose having been considered subhuman by the Nazis, I'm

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:33.160
conscious of my own position in the world and I'm dedicated to vulnerable people wherever

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:40.160
they are. In general, I work with people with autism spectrum disorders. I work with people

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:47.160
with autism disorders because that was my late son's condition. So three quarters of

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:54.160
my total spend of some 70 million to date is on autism and the rest is on my professional

00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:02.160
discipline of information technology. These are the two things I know and care about.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:10.160
There may be other things more important, but that is what I choose to do. I'm a very

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.160
good person. My venture philanthropy in autism resulted in quite a few Welsh projects. Because

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:24.160
I felt that a bilingual country was particularly hard for people with communication difficulties.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:32.160
In 1999, a very invigorating and creative year for me, I started several projects, one

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:40.160
of which was called Autism Connect, which was a portal website on autism and that combined

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:50.160
with the Welsh the words, saving the Blondifredd School for Autism from closure. When my consultant

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:58.160
looked at this school, the physical conditions were ghastly with wooden boards going across

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:05.160
a muddy playground out to the toilets. You knew very well that no inspector would visit

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:11.160
because he would have to have the school closed down forthwith. But you could see the excellent

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:18.160
teaching of extremely vulnerable, difficult to reach children. So I was happy to be able

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:26.160
to contribute to Wales in keeping that school going. I visited it in the last few years.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:33.160
It's now first class all round. I was also privileged to open the Ty Corridan School

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:41.160
for Autism in Cardiff. I've set up the all party parliamentary group for autism in Westminster,

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:50.160
and that had turned into the second largest such group. Because of that success, I tried

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:58.160
the same in Scotland, which failed, but was a success in Wales where the all party group

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:04.160
eventually merged with the national charity for Wales, Autism Cymru, which I also founded

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:11.160
and initially chaired. Autism Cymru had a lifespan of 11 years and took Wales to be

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:19.160
the first country in the world to have a national autism project. It was a success in the last

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:27.160
year. It also absorbed the Autism Connect portal website. As the National Ambassador

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:35.160
for Philanthropy in 2009 and 10, I spoke in the Senate Building to the Community Foundation

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:43.160
of Wales. I've set up another Welsh project about PEX, Picture Exchange Communication

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:50.160
System, where you're teaching children with, well, adults for that matter, with very little

00:11:53.160 --> 00:12:00.160
communication capabilities. By looking at picture exchange, you'd show a picture and

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:08.160
it's word underneath. Tomorrow you would see the same picture with the word underneath.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:15.160
You're trying to set up the association. Then day by day, the picture would get smaller

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:23.160
and smaller, leaving the word underneath. And many months later, the child is reading.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:31.160
Very basic stuff, but the beginnings of communication when you've got somebody who is really without

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:38.160
speech. That project was also subsumed into Autism Cymru. Autism Cymru was instrumental

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:48.160
in getting the first chair in autism, I think, in the world, certainly in Britain. That was

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:55.160
at Cardiff University and was a big step forward. Bilingual Wales certainly led the British

00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:03.160
Isles for some time in opening doors for people with autism and in looking after the half

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:11.160
a million autistic people and their families in Wales. And that's a quick summary of my

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.160
recollections of and relations with Wales.
