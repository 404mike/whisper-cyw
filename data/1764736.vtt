00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So if you could just introduce yourself.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I know where's the old tree now. If you overate that child.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Would do.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It's terrible for them.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Is he? He likes little ones, does he?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
He is.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If you could just tell me your name, your age and where we are.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Right.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
My name is Janice Partridge and we're at Splott Park.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I'm my age is 64.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Great. Thanks.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And I'm Anna and I work for Mancap and today's date is the 5th of October 2020.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So Janice, could you...

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So the first time that we met, you recorded your story with Stephen.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Yeah.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So Stephen isn't going to be recorded today. It's just going to be you.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Could you maybe, can you think back to when we first did the recording with Stephen

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and how your friendship might have changed or how things have been over the last few months for the two of you?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Well, the first time was at Central Station.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And we met somebody else who works with you.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Anita who took the photos.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Who was taking photos.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Yeah.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We went on the platform, we took a couple of photos, taking a few of Stephen and me on the station.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
But then you did one...

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And I think you did one in Mancap.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I don't know if you did one in Mancap.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Or was it at home? Did you come to...

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I think we did it in the Cardiff People First office, wasn't it?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
It did, yeah, in one of the offices.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Yeah. So how are you and Stephen these days?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
We keep in touch, but we can't really see one another now.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
But we keep in touch, we phone each other.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
He's okay. But we used to have an argument.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
If too many people interfered, you know, we'd okay by ourselves.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
But if someone else said, no, Steve, he'd be off like a shot.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And I'd be calling him back.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So who used to interfere then?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Who used to interfere?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Oh, the other members of People First.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Have you got an example of that?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Yeah, because I met a friend in town.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And you were in 35 years ago from the Blind Institute.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And Steve split up with his girlfriend and he was a bit disheartened.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And he took it out on me.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And we were in live lounge in town.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And I got a puzzle book out thinking, oh, Steve will be all right.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
He threw the puzzle book on the floor.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And my friend Rob told him off and he walked out and went train spotting.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So he can't handle any of the people telling him off.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
But he's liking it if I tell him as well.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And then on a Tuesday, before I was meeting the people in chapter,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
he came and he said, I'm sorry, Jan, about how I was.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Before you were there, he came and said, Jan, I'm sorry about how I performed the other day.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So I think he did realize.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
He does a bit of thinking and I think he realizes.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So we were okay in the chapter meeting you did.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And we were playing it in chapter as well as people first.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
That's when you were playing it back to us, our recording.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
We listened to it all together, didn't we?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Yeah, that's when you were playing it back to Steve and I was chapter.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
That was it, I remember.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So if you could...

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
So one of the reasons that we wanted to meet up was to find out how this last few months,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
how you've been doing, but also how that's affected some of your friendships,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
including your friendship with Steven.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So maybe if we think back to, and it's a little while ago now,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
in the run-up to the first lockdown,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
when before we all got stuck in our houses, what was that like?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Can you remember back to that?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
It was funny sometimes, when I had the TV, the radio.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And they said, you can do shopping, but you can't meet friends.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And now it's this, if you go to a restaurant, you can't sit with friends.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And we always got on and it's strange.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
You go to Queen's Falls or the restaurant, we used to book live lounge.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Before this lockdown, this double lockdown, we used to book a table for six people.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And now you can't even do that.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So you were doing that before this second lockdown?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Before the second lockdown.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
So during the first lockdown then?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
During the first lockdown, I could go shopping.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And then later on they said, you can't meet friends now.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
But in this one they said, you can't meet friends.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So I think, well, who am I going to see?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
I just got the telly at home.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So you live by yourself, Janice?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
I live by myself.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
During the first lockdown, did you see anybody at all?

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Yeah, I used to go and have coffee with them in coffee shops.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
But there were no coffee shops in the first lockdown.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
You could only sit outside and you couldn't go sit in them.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And one day I was with them and I don't know, it was on a Monday.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And I felt you couldn't use their inside toilet.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I had to walk to St. David's Centre with Emma to go to the toilet.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And it upset my stomach a bit because if I don't go when I want to,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
something else happens later.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
I get upset stomach if I can't go to the toilet straight away.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
So we had to walk over to coffee run and they let us use our disabled toilet.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
But when we got to the first half, I had another stomach ache.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000
I suffer badly if I can't get to a toilet on time.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And in this first lockdown, that happened, but not in the second one.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
So in the first one, because at the very beginning we were only allowed to go out.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
We were only allowed to go out of our houses.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
No, just for a walk, wasn't it?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Only shopping and medication.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Did you do your own shopping or did someone help you?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I always do my own.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
I remember someone lying with my Iceland or the Mollisons for me in the first one

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
because it was difficult to get out.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
So he said, Jan, when I do something, I'll get some things for you.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Tell me what you need and I'll do one for you.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And he used to do extra things for me as well as his own shopping.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And then I'd go round there and get them all for him.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And so did you see your brother quite a bit in the beginning?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
More in the first lockdown.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
I don't so much in this one.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
But he said to me, if you go out with your friends,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
you don't want me to go out with them and give it to him so I can understand that.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
So that's why I can't explain to my friends that I'm not going out.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And they don't understand it.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
They say, yes, you've got to get out, Jan.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
You've got fresh air in you.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
But I said, how can I if I can't?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
I sat out in my garden with people where I live in the first lockdown.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
So you've got a garden of you?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Well, it used to be of its ventures now with a few flowers.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
But at one time when I moved there, they had a seat with an umbrella, a table with an umbrella.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
They took that away and just got ventures now.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
So do you share the garden with other people or is it just yours?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Well, we had our own ventures, but I did used to share the garden with other residents.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Do you know your neighbours?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Oh, I know them quite well.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
They were done repair work when my light bulb was gone because my rubber can't get round to do it.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And last week I had to have filled those out.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
It all happened.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
My alarm card, you know that you press if you come and see me to let you in.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
That went.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
The light in the hallway went.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
My fire light gone in case I can't hear anything with the fire.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
All that went.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
So I had to have them out last week to fix it.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Luckily, they came out to do it and everything is done now.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And they sent a survey to CCHA because in the first lockdown they weren't sending anyone out.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
So what would have happened if you'd got no lights or something?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Well, I'd have to go on to the CCHA.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
But they're closed now.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
But they've told us now in this one that we can get the engineers and do repairs.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
But in the first one you couldn't.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
So if something went wrong there, you just had to wait until they could.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And I'm thinking, well, I'm glad now that I could and they did.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
So that was the housing association.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
CCHA or Adamsdown, Meteor Street and Tovo Court.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
They say we are closed.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
If you stay on, we'll get someone.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
They told me the first time I have to get on the ladder and do it.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And I said, no, that's not on.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
So your neighbours helped, did you say?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
So one neighbour changed the small room light.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Well, this was the fluorescent lighting on the ceiling in the hallway as you opened the front door.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And he wanted me to get on that and I'm fixing it.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
I said, I can't do it.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
So I've never can't do it.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
He's not allowed to move or get up.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
So I said, I need someone to come out and do it.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000
So that's what he did in the second lockdown, but they weren't in the first one.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So in the first lockdown, you used to be in your garden, did you say?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Did you invite people to your garden?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
No, we used to go down there and we could share it.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
With the other residents?

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
We couldn't sit too close to them.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
We had to find spaces on the bench.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
I enjoyed it.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
So who are you? Are you friends with your neighbours?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Oh yes, I get on very well with them.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Hello Janice, how are you?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And do any of them have a learning disability?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
I think I'm the only one that has one.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Some of them are elderly, but one of them is visually impaired.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And I knew him, he used to go to the blind institute, Robert.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
He's blind in one eye.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And I didn't know when I went out, they knocked the bin bag in the wrong one, you see.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000
So I didn't know he was visually impaired because I didn't know him after the institute.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000
So I said to the one there, a bag is in the wrong bin.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Now I didn't know this person was blind.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
So she said, Jolly Jolly is visually impaired in one eye.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
So after that, I was only thinking of what the institute had let us say.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Must use the right bin, must use the right one.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Some people were putting green bags in our bin shed and it should go on the corner of the street,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Arvid Duffy Street.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000
So our first warden never explained the fire procedure to me when I moved.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
So I didn't know which ends of fire escapes were.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
So the second warden said, Jan, I'll show you where they are.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Now you'd think the first one would have, but she didn't.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
They get rid of them so quick, I haven't got any now.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
I used to phone them, they'd call me, Janice, how are you?

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
They're charging us for telling them.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And that's not on.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
So my brother said, Jan, text me every day.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
So what shall I do?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
If you're going out, text me every day.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And I used to go to my friend's and for weekends in People First.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
But now we can't do that because of this new lockdown.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
I used to do it with them at New Year's Day, Duffy, they had a couple of days.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Her brother is my boyfriend, see.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
I found him through her.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
They're a sister and they live in Kvalfa and they're members of People First.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
So you've got a boyfriend now, Janice?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Yeah, after mum.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Can you tell me a bit more about him?

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
He's deaf in two and I'm deaf in one, one of them.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
He's deaf in the two and I'm deaf in the one.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And I went to his house one night before the lockdown and I asked him for a,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
an hand said, do you want a drink, Jan?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And I asked him for a Coke and he passed me my Coke.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
What a compilation.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
And I dropped a can of Coke and he picked up my Coke.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
I said, no, I'm staying.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
So where did you meet him? Through Ann?

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Through Ann.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000
We had a dating thing and where I used to go to uni with Ann.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And that's when I met Ann with People First and she helped in the university

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
because of me being deaf.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
The tutors would say, are you going to do this, Janice?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And the one tutor, she'd say to her, you have to explain she's deaf.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And if I never had my friend there I would have still been struggling now.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
So how did you first meet, what's your boyfriend's name, sorry?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Andrew.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Andrew.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
He's Ann's brother, Andrew Sowery.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Okay, so where did you, how did you first meet Andrew?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
How did that come about?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
I think that was Live Lounge.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Yeah, and I used to meet them in, not Live Lounge, it was called Bye Live Lounge.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000
There was a restaurant somewhere and I used to meet them in, and they'd say,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
it used to be Bye Live Lounge.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
I don't remember the name.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000
But that was when I first met Andrew.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And I was going to their house to stay for the weekend and they said,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
we'll meet you, Jan, in this place, and so and so and so.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000
So I used to go there beforehand until I could be there ready to meet them.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
And they were like...

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Right, so on to part two of the 5th of October 2020 with Janice and Anna in Splot.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
So Janice, sorry about that.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:19.000
You were talking about, you and, about your, I was asking about your brother,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.000
how he feels about your relationship with Andrew.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000
How does your brother react?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
I don't know.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
They all think he's just my friend.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Because I've let it be he's my friend because I don't want to route with them.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:49.000
So I have told them he's my friend.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
So who does know that he's more than just a friend then?

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000
We're not really involved like getting married or getting engaged or anything.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
That's not something you want.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
He said he just wanted to stay as good friends.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
So at the moment, are you just good friends or more than?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
We're just good friends until we see a bit more of each other after this lockdown.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
So before the lockdown, how often did you see Andrew?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:26.000
I used to go to them to stay weekends before the lockdown, before the first lockdown.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
And did you and Andrew share a room?

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
I used to stay with them.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
They were very happy.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
I had a friend, Becky.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
And Becky used to see Anna as well.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
And then I had Becky asking me, can she stay at mine?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
She can't, it's only for me.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
It's a housing place just for me.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:53.000
And see Anna, we are trying to tell Becky that she can't stay at Jan's.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
So one day she said, oh, can I stay with you for the weekend, Jan?

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
I said, no, Fex, Ollie, you can't.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
She said that I said she can.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
So I can't get through to her.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
How about Andrew? Did Andrew ever get to stay at your place?

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
No.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
No?

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Because Anna invited me to stay because mine's only one bedroom flat.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
And do you have a single or a double bed?

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
If I had a room with another bed seat in it, it would be all right.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
But I got that bed.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
But if my sister came over.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000
So do you share a room with Andrew at his flat or do you have your own room?

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
With him because he's your boyfriend.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
I'm with him.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Yeah.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
And so you've been together for a while, but at the moment...

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
At the moment, the lockdown's over.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
So did you get to see him in between the two lockdowns then?

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
I haven't seen him in any.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
You've not seen... So when was the last time you saw him?

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
I saw him for a while on the phone, but not seen him since the two lockdowns.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
So back in March?

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
That's why I seen him, which was before the March lockdown.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
And have you been in touch during that time?

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
On my phone I didn't text her.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
But that's all we could do at the moment.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
It's phone each other and send a text.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
And so have you been more in touch with Angela than you have with Andrew?

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
No, more in touch with Andrew than I have with Andrew.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
I'm sorry.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Because I was hearing on the phone.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Ah. Does he message and stuff or...?

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
I actually got engaged last year.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Her fiancé is nice, Kevin.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
And he talked to me like that, you know.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Sometimes people don't.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
And I went to an engagement party.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
But this recce didn't.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
And he got out that they got engaged.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
And I said to Anne,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
recce, you know why she didn't come to your party?

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
She said, because I don't want her there.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
And I had to...

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
I didn't know what to say to recce, so I used to say Anne.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Because Anne is good friends with recce's fiancé online.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
On Facebook, you see.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
And she used to go to Anne's.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Now I wouldn't do this.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
She used to go to Anne's with Steve and say,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
can we both stay?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Now I wouldn't do that with someone's flat.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
I'm not that kind of person.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
I wouldn't take...

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
If I had a boyfriend and he wasn't Andrew,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
I wouldn't go to my...

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
If I had a brother, I wouldn't go to my friend's flat.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
I'd say, can he stay as well?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Put on Anne, you see. It wasn't right.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
So she just turned...

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
I went to them once.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
She invited me to meet them.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
And go on the New Year's Eve and stay the New Year's Day.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
And the day after.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
She somehow found out.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Not from me. I don't know who she found out from.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
She had to phone Anne's while I was staying there.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
And she could hear me laughing.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
I said, Janice is there.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
And it was Anne's 40th birthday.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
And I was invited there for the birthday.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
And suddenly,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
on the Wednesday night, on the Tuesday night,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
in Royal Stephen and Becky.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
I was thinking...

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
I said, I'd like to see if I could run over to her place.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
I said, what are you two doing here?

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
She said, well, Janice is here.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Why can't we be here?

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
But I only stayed till the Friday.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
I stayed for a week.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
I went on Tuesday and stayed till Friday.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
So on the Friday, I phoned Anne to say thanks for the whole week.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
And actually, I heard Becky's voice and I was thinking,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
I thought they'd gone.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
No, she doesn't want to go till Monday, Jan.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Now I wouldn't do that if I was staying.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
I'd say, OK, I've got to go now.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
If I am, you know.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
I wouldn't say, can I stay longer?

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
I'm not like that.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
But if Becky is like that, very persistent,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
very persuasive, so I'm thinking,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
I thought they'd gone.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
No, she don't want to go till Monday.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
And I'm thinking, well, I would never do that.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
If I was staying with anyone else, why is she doing this?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
So you've not been in touch with Andrew the whole time?

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Not the whole time, the first or second lockdown.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Only Anne.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Because he's not hearing me.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
I just speak to her and I say, oh, it's Andrew.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
And so does he not use text or Facebook or anything?

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
I think he's not used to it because he's hearing.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Right.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
His hearing is worse than mine because he got two.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
I just hope he gets this one.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
And I think it's sad to have two.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
But a couple of weeks ago, we were never able to do this

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000
because I was full with wax in my ear.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
And I went to this cafe asking for something,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
not realizing I can't hear because I went to see Tony Moly

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
thinking I could hear his songs.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
I could hear them, but not as good as when my ear is working.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
So I go to Specsavers.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
They can help because there's not many people in on a Friday

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
and it's lockdown.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
So I thought we'd rather go.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
And I said, they said, I went to Specsavers on a Monday with my sister

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
and he said, there's such a lot of wax in both ears.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
It's why you can't hear.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
So I went to have them done in this ritual clinic

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
because clinic over here don't syringe now.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.000
So they do micro surgery, micro, and that's called 60 pound.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
And I thought, well, I needed to get it out.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
They say that much and I said, well, I needed to get the wax out.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
And if there's no clinic doing it like they used to,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
what am I going to do?

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
So I've never found this clinic online.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
And I went up there and I didn't know how to get the wax out,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
so I had a taxi.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
But now I know, well, first again, my sister met me at the clinic

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
because I said, I don't know the lady and what do I do?

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
She said, well, Christine will be, my sister lives in Dade Court.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
She met me at the clinic with my niece and then we met my niece

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
and went for a coffee and coffee won.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
So he said, you'll have to have your fax card, Jan,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
because it's costing 60 pound.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
And people say 60?

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
I don't care how long this is out.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
I didn't care how long as I got the wax out.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
And I sat there comfy.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
I always sit comfy.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000
I let people do it.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
And there's some people can't do that.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
I sat there letting them do it.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
And then the optician looked.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
He said, you use a bit of red where they use their things.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
But he didn't want red to affect it.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
It's not hurting or rubbing.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
So it just went away.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
There's lots of people who wouldn't sit there and have it

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
what I had done.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
And I'm thinking, yes, but he can't leave it in.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Now one of my friends, Shahid, he has his microphone,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
his headphones, and I said, they make you deaf.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
I said, no wonder you're deaf.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
And he says, I won't wax.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
And he says, well, go on, have it done then.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
So have you been able to stay in touch with other friends

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
during this time then?

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Have you been all right staying in touch with your other friends?

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Lisa likes staying in touch with.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
I've been before last Friday.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000
I went to a house.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Well, you can't now, see, because we had the lockdown on the Sunday.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
So the Friday before, Lisa's mother's nice.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
And Lisa said, would you like to come, Lisa, to the house?

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
So I reached her in town and we get the bus.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
And the other week, I forgot about lockdown.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
And they said, oh, your first lesson would have to be in college.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000
I think, oh, yeah, it is.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000
And I go to the college, locked up, no one there.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
I think, what do I do?

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
They told me go to college.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
But then the tutor told me it would have been the lockdown came in,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
so it's not.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
So now I know it's online every Friday.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
So the college, have you been doing that the whole time or?

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Well, since last September.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
OK, so how's that been working this last few months then?

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
So they were doing it from the first lockdown that it was online.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
It was in Zoom then.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Now it's not in Zoom, it's in Google Classroom, which is online.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
So I did Zoom last week because I haven't done it before online.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000
And so what do you use?

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Do you have like a laptop or?

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
I use my mobile, but my iPad isn't working.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
So it is not working and they don't get it done.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
I'll treat myself to a new one Christmas.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000
I had this one on my brother's mate because he was selling his iPad.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000
So my friend got me the iPhone 5 mobile, which I use now.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000
But he's giving me his iPhone 8 because he got iPhone 11.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
So we're going to try to get him through his house to swap phones.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
So that's why I haven't been out with the others because I got to think of Stephen first.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
So college has been all online during this time?

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Yeah.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
And you do that on your phone?

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
I got my iPhone from the July of last year.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
And now online from these Fridays until the college.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Or lively we used to use it back to normal.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
And how do you find it using Zoom and everything?

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Well last week I found, I was getting it with Zoom and she said it's not Zoom.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Well, so she gave me the things that I got to do this week on my phone.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000
So I'm going around to Stephen on my phone so he can put them onto my new iPhone 8.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Stephen's ship brother?

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Yeah.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
This is Stephen, my brother.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
But he had the same name.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
And it felt the same way.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
So this is Stephen, my brother.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000
I don't know.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.000
He's going to, when I get around to see him, swap the phone and put this new,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:10.000
she sent me the Google network codes and the ID.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.000
And he's going to swap them over to the new ones from my iPhone 5.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Because more goes on the later iPhones than the iPhone 5.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Because they're trying to get me to have this COVID-19 NHS thing.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
And that wouldn't work on my iPhone 5 because of the memory.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
So he said it won't work on the iPhone 8.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
How do you feel about having that app?

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
I said okay, he's getting it out of the, what he's doing, he's getting it.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:47.000
We've got a joint account so he's getting this phone for me and buying it from the joint account we've got.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Your brother?

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
My brother, yeah.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
So it sounds like you and your brother have been...

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
We couldn't go around there over the weekend.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:03.000
She said, it's nice Monday, come have this meal and we'll do the phones.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
So has your brother been helping out quite a bit during this time?

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
He has been helping out quite a bit.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
So what kind of things has he been...

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
He's been getting shopping, if he gets shopping.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Are we keeping touch with you over the iPhone?

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
I thought, I texted him today, can you go to the clinic I've asked you this afternoon?

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
He goes to the clinic for his bandages changed.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
So I always text him to say, I'll be telling Anna, what time are you going to the clinic?

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:44.000
And he said I've asked you today Jan, so I'll see you a bit later after your meeting.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:54.000
So after this, I'll go to the shopping and then maybe after this clinic, go up to him.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
After or before the clinic, depends how long he's in his clinic.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Do you get on pretty well with your brother then?

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
I do, yeah, because I'm closer to him than my sister.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
I'm with my sister, she phones every week.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:17.000
And then she might phone when I'm with the others, when I'm out with the others and I can't do the phone call properly.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Who's the others?

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Like my friends that I used to be with in the first lockdown.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
So who would that be? Who would you...

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Mark, Emma, Rob, Shaheed, people from Cardiff People First and the Blind Institute.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.000
And I'm thinking now, this one, we can't be with them, but we could in the other one.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
So I think you can meet outside, can't you? It's just not inside.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
You can meet outside, not in places.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Like this Tony, he sings outside on the haze.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000
So that would be different. And then we go sitting outside all in coffee one after him.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:02.000
And there now, you can only sit outside, not go inside again.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:09.000
But Shaheed told me last week that he told the lady that she let them go inside because he said,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
well, we all live together. Well, we don't.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:18.000
He's telling fibs, saying that we all live together, but they let them go in because he said that.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.000
I wasn't with them, but he told me, I told them that we're all together, so they let us in.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000
I said, you shouldn't tell them that if you're not. You've got to do track and trace.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
How do you find it, keeping up with all the rules?

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:40.000
I do track and trace by filling the paper out. I do a lot of scanning on my phone.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.000
So they say you have these cards and you put them in and they're sent to the NHS.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
So you just put your name and your mobile number and put it in the box.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:58.000
They do that in the Wethersfoos restaurants. If you haven't done it, by scanning your phone.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
So have you been in between the two lockdowns? Did you get out quite a bit then?

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
More than one lockdown than this lockdown.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000
So you said you meet up with people from People First. Are the People First groups still running?

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Well, they all see this tone and then go for a drink afterwards.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000
So have the People First groups been running still?

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
They get interested. They'll need a dog.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Have the People First groups been running still?

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.000
No, they're not back until January. They didn't know how long these two lockdowns were going on for.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:43.000
So lots of things like lunch and clever back February. So I thought, oh dear.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
So how's that been for you?

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
I don't know. I'm going to celebrate my birthday soon.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
When's your birthday?

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
January the 15th is on a Friday.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Same day as me.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Same day as you. Same day as my surrogatist.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000
I used to be my surrogateist, she's the 15th.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
So you don't know how you're going to celebrate your birthday?

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
I don't know if it's lockdown, whether we're going to be over, whether we can meet or not.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
So People First haven't been meeting online or anything?

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:21.000
They do Zoom, outstanding of speaking out, and on a Thursday afternoon on Zoom.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
And do you go to those Zoom meetings?

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
I got the Zoom on my phone to join in from home.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
They gave me the codes and the numbers.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Now yesterday our church meets once a month.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
And they gave me the code, they sent me the message.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
I was doing the code and they said, the code is not recognised.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Try again. And they said, your ID is not recognised.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
I thought, oh flinkey neck.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
How do I get in?

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
So I phoned someone and they said, well keep trying.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
So I kept trying. I eventually got in to Causeway.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000
And I do a Bible study after because I used to go to Alfa.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000
That's right, I used to go to Alfa in City Church.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000
And that started back for a couple of weeks last night.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
And then they do it for the first seven weeks next year.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:24.000
So I managed to get into that, but not into the Causeway or the Bible class.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000
How do you find using Zoom? Do you find it easy to use?

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000
It's OK, they do the meeting ID right and the code right.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
So they sent me the IDs and the password or passcode.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:45.000
And I got in OK for the offer, but not for Causeway or Bible class.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000
Or Bible study. So I thought, what am I going to do?

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
So I told the lady, I'll leave it and try again next week.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Because I was halfway through and I had no point in trying.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
So she said, leave it till next week, child.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
And hopefully I can get through to the mall.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
So it sounds like you have quite a few groups that you're doing online.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
I'm doing them online, yeah.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000
But none of those groups have been meeting in real...

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
They've been meeting in person yet.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
And have you been finding it? How does that...

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Well, I'm finding it OK if I can do the right ID and the right code.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Because they give me the times they are and the code and the ID before I get into them.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
And last night it didn't work for Causeway or...

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
It worked for Alpha, but it didn't work for Causeway or the Bible study.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
So I thought, oh.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000
So when that happens, how does that make you feel?

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
I told the woman, I said, can't get in. And she said, I'll try again next time.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000
And are you missing going to meet people?

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000
I'm missing meeting people in person.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
So you used to meet up with people and go and watch your friend?

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Yeah, we met last week, last night at the 147.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000
But if I never had this Alpha, I would have...

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000
147 is only the other end of City Road.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
So I thought, if I never had the Alpha, I would have...

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
And I told my friend I will.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000
And then I found out I couldn't because of the Alpha class.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000
So I let my friend know that I wouldn't be able to.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
For another three weeks.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000
So some of your friends are meeting up at the 147 Club?

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000
They do, yeah. They still keep saddled for the Play Background music.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Because they can't have live music at the moment.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
So they just have background.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
And I found out that this Friday, the King's Castle,

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
they're doing Play Your Cards Right and Bingo.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
And a bit of background music.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
I wouldn't mind going along to that.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
I wouldn't mind if it was a nice weather Friday.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Going along to see what it is.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Because it's in King's Castle.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
I used to live in Canton.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
And it's the King's Road, the King's Castle.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
It's only you get...

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
I used to get the best in town and the 60 run to go to it.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
So have you been during this time to any pubs?

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000
If I knew who was going, I wouldn't mind going here, leaving this week to try it out.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
None of the others like King's Castle, only me.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000
So I thought, go on my own. I meet people in there.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Go on, Linda and Sharon and all them.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
So who are Linda?

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
And them in there.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
So I have got people there, but not my friends.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Who's Linda and Sharon?

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000
They're my friends.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
They're people that go to the King's Castle evening.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
So people you got to know there?

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Yeah.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000
And none of my social friends like the King's Castle.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
So I thought, well, if it's nice weather, I'll go on my own this Friday

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000
and see who's there and I'll go on what goes on.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Forever Fridays.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
And have you been to the 147 during this time?

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Only before this new lockdown.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000
So you used to go then, did you?

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Yeah, I used to meet them in town.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Who did you meet up with?

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000
I used to meet Mark, Emma Vainton and Shaheed.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
And they're all friends from People First?

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Yeah, Emma Vainton is, yeah, and Shaheed.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
And Mark is, he was young People First when they had it.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
And they all text me, Janice, you're coming out.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Janice, you're doing this.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Janice, what are you doing?

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000
And I'm thinking, well, my friend Ralph told me,

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
you've got to get out or you'll make yourself ill.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
And I remember saying, no, in case I go round to him and he gets.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Earlier in the year he thought he had it because he came up in a rash.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
And he thought he had it.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000
But he did the test and he didn't.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Because he came up in a rash with his legs, he thought he had it.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
So they said to him, we'll get a test.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
And when the test came back, I posted it for him.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000
And when it came back and I didn't know, it goes in the ordinary post box.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
So I said to him, I collected it from his house.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
And he said, I thought they went to the post office.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000
But they don't.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Things like that go in ordinary full of box.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
And my brother said, no, not post office, ordinary full of box.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000
So anyway, I did it on a Friday and he got the results on Sunday saying everything was clear.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
But he didn't have me, I didn't know what he was doing.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
He didn't have me to go round and do it.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000
So I helped him out and he helped me out.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000
Until this lockdown.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Do you know anyone who has had it?

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000
I don't know.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000
Some of my friends, they are illnesses and they've been exempt from wearing a mask.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000
So when people say wear your mask, if you're exempt, you don't have to.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
How do you feel about wearing the masks?

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000
I don't mind it.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000
First what my sister said was strange, but then I got used to it.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
And they say, if you're out, you've got to go up to the counter with your mask on.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Now, they say inch off, they're left at the counter with your mask on.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
You haven't got to leave it on, just put it on to go up to the counter.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
And inch off, you've got to put it on before.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
And now I got it because you've got to put it on before you get on the bus.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000
So I'm more used to it now than when my sister first mentioned it.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
I got several masks because I got them in packs.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
They do them in packs of two or packs of three.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000
And the other day, the strap snapped when I was in town.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:40:00.000
So I went to Home Vagans, Foul Land, and in Foul Land, they sold them two in a pack for a mask.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
I thought, who sells them?

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Where can I get one?

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000
I thought, who sells them?

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
Where can I get one?

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000
That was on Friday when I was going to meet Lisa.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Not this Friday, the Friday before.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
Have you and Stephen met up at all during this time?

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
Not met at all since then.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
He speaks to me on the phone, Steve West.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
I phone him when he phones me.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
I phone him if I have any interest in him and then he phones me.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000
He phones me Saturday and Sunday, this week. I'm honoured.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000
So what was he ringing about?

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000
He reads the news. He always tells me about what's going on, what they've said, if I haven't had it on.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
Because I like challenge all the quizzes.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
I'm answering the questions. I recorded them today for when I go back.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000
I record them with my mouth for when I go back later.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000
There's Corey Eastender, I know Eastender's tonight.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
Corey and Emmerdale, two Corys, so I'm all right tonight.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
So Stephen, you mentioned...

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000
So, third attempt.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000
With Janice and Anna in Splot on the 5th of October 2020.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:28.000
So Janice, are there any things that you would want people to know about this last few months?

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
How it's been for you and what it's been like?

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Yeah, it's just been difficult since the second lockdown.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
First lockdown I was seeing everyone and all in the second one.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000
And how does that feel?

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
It's been a bit distressing.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000
But if I never had the TV for the programmes I would have been worse.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
So I'm watching the programmes on repeats on challenge.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
I answer the questions a few things.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Well, how did you know? Because they're repeats!

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Oh dear.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
So you like the quiz shows?

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
And I like the dinner crochet.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000
Now I'm starting to...

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000
Well if I can't do it, I'll have to sit and make Christmas cards early.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
I don't leave it until the last minute.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000
I make family cards, I do my own making.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
I get the things, I've got the things that I haven't gone on to making though.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
I think one day when I'm in I will...

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000
And I knit in blanket squares because my sister said there's no squares to do a blanket.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000
It will keep you busy while lockdown's on.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000
And how are you feeling about Christmas coming up?

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000
I know, I can't believe it. They're all full in.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000
So many days to Christmas.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000
I say, Shalev!

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000
I go, Vicki ain't saying it's not so long now to Christmas!

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000
Or what's that? And I'm in Shalev and I'll say it.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
What do you normally do at Christmas?

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000
I mainly stay on my own.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000
I used to go to Stephen's part when she was alive.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Your brother.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000
I used to spend Christmas even come home crossing day.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000
I used to stay longer when I lived in Canton because I was in Canton and they were in his flat.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000
And then it was snowing and I thought, I can't walk around in the snow, what am I going to do?

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000
So what do you think is going to happen this year?

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.000
I remember when he got out of the taxi and I was down with my feet getting into the path.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000
The taxi driver was very helpful.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000
He said she just won't move.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000
My sister said, oh come on Jan.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:04.000
So when I was coming home on the voxing day, what morning, she put the great thing down so I could walk okay in the night.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000
So I did run into getting the taxi for getting home.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Have you seen your sister during this time?

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
I haven't seen them. They told me I haven't seen them.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Just your brother?

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000
They knocked him out. All this is said, oh it's over.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000
And how have you found it understanding the rules and everything?

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
I don't like to understand them.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
And any of your friends found it difficult or do you think?

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000
Some friends find it difficult.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000
No.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Like some of my friends told me, if you want a meal in a restaurant,

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:55.000
if you go by the castle, it's undercover and Deliveroo, delivering a meal to you.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000
Because you can't sit with a friend in a restaurant.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
So if you reach at the castle and you want to go to an order,

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000
if you're at McDonald's they get Deliveroo to send it to the castle to you.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
And you're thinking, what are you on about?

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000
So you've not done it?

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000
I've not done it because I never realised, are they telling the truth?

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000
They say they're doing that until you can sit with friends again,

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
order it through the restaurant and Deliveroo will bring it to you.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000
So I'm thinking, I'll go there one day and see if they're right.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Have you been...

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000
So you and Andrew, what's going to happen there then?

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000
I don't know, we don't see each other until all this is finished.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
So you didn't get to see each other even when things were a bit more relaxed?

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000
No.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
So why was that? Why was it you didn't see each other?

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Well, because nobody could keep in touch with each other.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
Except online or by phone.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
But you managed to meet up with some of your friends.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Some of them were local to me in town.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
So does he not go into town or anything?

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
No and again I might.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
But does Andrew not go into town?

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000
No, no, because he wouldn't understand what's happening.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Right.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000
If he goes out he would be with his sister in the car.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000
So he needs quite a bit of support, does he?

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
He can't get out himself with the two years in.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000
I mean I can't because I got the one.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
But with two I suppose you can't really.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000
So he can't go and let his sister or the fiancé take him.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
His sister or the fiancé go out.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000
And then he goes out and he's with his sister.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
And then they go out.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
So I think it's more difficult for him than for me.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Have you been missing him then or have you been alright?

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000
I don't know.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000
I've been asking her how he is and she tells me.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Are there any last things then Janice that you would want people to know about the last few months?

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000
There's a lockdown, well, I just think it's what she would have done.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000
It's over.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Shall we finish up there then?

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.000
That's great, thank you.
