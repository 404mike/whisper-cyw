00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
So how did your father and mother meet?

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:15.040
That was an arrangement made by the head of what was termed the Manchester Yeshiva, where

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:23.360
he had gone as a boy of twelve, and the principal of that Yeshiva turned round to my grandfather

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.720
who was the treasurer of that institution and said, listen, you've got your youngest

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:37.120
daughter. I think that she should carry on the orthodox tradition. There's a young man

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:47.440
that's come that's got a number of diplomas from the Mere Yeshiva in Poland, and he's

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.440
a nice chap in my opinion, and you ought to get together and make a marriage of the two.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.640
So it was, and we've got a picture inside of the actual marriage ceremony taking place

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.640
in the Chaikramsul Synagogue.
