00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.220
So where did you go to school? Well initially in Whitchurch. I went to the

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.100
State School and that didn't work out very well because I couldn't speak

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.980
English and I was teased mercilessly. I don't think you can call it bullying,

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.140
it wasn't physical, it was just, you know, they would call me names. Jerry was the

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.300
favorite one because of course the war just started and they would run around

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.160
pretending to be airplanes as little children did in those days with arms

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.760
outstretched making noises and I was always the Messerschmitt which got shot

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.160
at. Anyway it was, it wasn't very pleasant and the fact that I couldn't

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.380
speak a word of English of course and no effort was really made to include me in

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.260
the lessons. So every day at break time at ten o'clock I sneaked out through the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.280
gate and ran home and this went on for three or four months apparently until

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.440
well nobody missed me for a start but I was caught by my father's sister, my aunt

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.120
who came to visit my mother unexpectedly and found me sitting on the railway

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.120
bangman watching the trains and of course she told my mother and that was

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.540
the first intimation that my mother had that something had gone wrong at school

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.760
and then they took me away from there and sent me to a small private school

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.120
called Macefield House and then that lasted for about a year including

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.920
through all the air raids and so on which quite often we were caught either

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.840
on the way home as the planes came over and the sirens went and we were told

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.840
well you go to the nearest house and ask them can you shelter which we did on a

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.260
few occasions and then eventually Macefield House closed down and the

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.180
whole school was transferred to another small private school and maybe two or

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.780
three hundred yards away called Lamorna and then I was there right up until the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.900
age of 11 so really I was in the Lamorna school for maybe four or five years then I

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:17.740
did my 11 plus exam and by some quirk of fate because Wichurch wasn't part

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.800
of Cardiff in those days it was part of Glamorgan and there were two schools on

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.960
offer either there was Wichurch Grammar School or there was P'Nath Grammar

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.800
School which is there over the road and I think because my name started with S

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.520
and they had too many people I was put down to go to P'Nath now for anyone who

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:48.040
lived in Wichurch being sent to P'Nath was as bad as failing your 11 plus so my

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.100
parents then decided to send me to Christ College in Brecon which is a

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.580
public school and I was there for the next seven years
