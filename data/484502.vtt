Interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.640
Interviewee Caroline Sevens.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.520
Venue Swicker Office.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.920
And the date today is Tuesday the 18th of November.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.600
Caroline, would you be kind enough to spell your name in full for posterity?

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.800
Of course. C-A-R-O-L-I-N-E-S-E-M-M-E-N-S.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.480
Thank you very much indeed.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.000
So how did you first come into contact with Swicker?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.600
I had graduated university in 2001 with an English degree, which allows you to do nothing.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.480
So I knew I wanted to specialise in something.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.720
So I came back to Cardiff and studied at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.400
and did a post-grad in Arts Management.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.680
Towards the end of my year there, we had to do a month work placement

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.400
and I worked for David Baxter in the Education Department of St David's Hall.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:12.200
And whilst we were there, he was talking about what I wanted to do after I graduated.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.120
And look for a job was obviously my main priority.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.280
And he at the time was trustee for Swicker and said that there was a place coming up for an administrator,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.000
as the administrator who'd been here for many, many years was leaving,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.160
and put me forward for an interview, which I came to, got the job and the rest is history.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.120
2002.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.160
2002. So talking of history, how many Cardiff Carnivals did you help create and support

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.280
and run around like a crazy girl?

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.720
Looking at the list, I think it's four between 2002 and 2005,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.520
starting with Citizenship and ending with Doc's Wales window on the world,

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.400
trading places in spirit of Mother Earth.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.680
And do you still have the emotional scars?

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.960
Absolutely. Physical, emotional. No, not at all.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.680
Yeah.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.920
What are your memories of Cardiff Carnival?

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.640
Let's start with Cardiff Carnival in particular.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.240
Well, I guess it's an unusual one for me being on an administrative side

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.800
rather than being a participator or an artist or a spectator.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.000
I had seen the carnival.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.480
I'd never deliberately come to see the carnivals, but I was very much aware of them.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.520
I'd been in the place where they were happening, so I knew that they happened.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.920
I hadn't obviously had any idea on the kind of background to them,

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.200
all the workshops that took place, all the hard work behind the scenes.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.760
I only just witnessed the carnival day itself and the parade passing and thinking,

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.960
oh, that's spectacular and didn't think too much of it.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.520
So, you know, coming from it from the other angle and seeing all the work

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.320
that was involved was a big, big eye-opener.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.240
It was also my first, I say my first job.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.840
I'd had jobs before, but, you know, a full-time permanent position in terms of the arts.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.600
It was so it was, yeah, it was a massive eye-opener to see all the work

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.960
that went involved, all the people that kind of came and got involved,

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.920
the communities that built over those few months of the mass camps

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.520
and then the actual days itself.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.200
And yeah, the actual parade is almost this kind of strange sense of anticlimax

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.120
of the fact that you've worked with these people, you know, day in, day out.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.440
You know, for all the time leading up to it and in all the mass camps,

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.160
which were, you know, like a proper family and a community got built in those in those weeks.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.560
And then whilst the parade was amazing, there was also that sense of and what happens now.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.480
And, you know, for the people working on it, it wasn't too bad because back then,

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.200
we would shut down for a week, get everything back in a van and then ship to Swansea

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.360
and, you know, and do something in Swansea a few weeks later.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.280
But yeah, it was a strange sense of amazing anticlimax.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.200
I guess it's the same thing as putting on a theatre show.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.400
You know, you work really hard, you do a show for a week and then that's it.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.480
And you wave goodbye and hope to see each other next time.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.480
So, yeah, it's an amazing experience.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.320
Certainly that that that whole phenomena of post-Carnival blues is very real

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.880
because people get to a very positive space and they find themselves in this

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.920
sort of mini village of collective creativity.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.400
And then they get to hopefully, well, generally be applauded and cheered,

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.840
sometimes in sunshine, sometimes in rain,

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.560
after which, yes, life seems a little less colorful and flamboyant, doesn't it?

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.320
I mean, that's a real phenomenon for people.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.400
Yeah. And the Cardiff one for me, coming from Cardiff or just outside Cardiff

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.040
and, you know, living here my life and living a few years away from university.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.120
It was it opened up a whole new part of Cardiff for me.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.000
When I was growing up in a fairly middle class,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.640
you know, upbringing, butan, you just wouldn't go to, you know, butan was rough.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.640
It was scary. It was dangerous.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.920
Ironically, my dad grew up in East Tindall Street.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.200
You know, he was a docks boy and even he was kind of raising eyebrows about,

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.200
you know, it's changed since I was a boy back in the 1940s, 50s.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.440
It's very different. There's a lot of black people there.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.480
There's a lot of immigrants.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.800
You know, is it safe to be there?

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.480
And yet I and I I hope it's still the same to this day.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.480
What I found from Butan was the residents of Butan and what people

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.600
will class as the scary, the dangerous, the rough, the the unknown

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.840
quantity of Butan with the strongest community I've ever, ever experienced

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.040
and and have done since.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.000
I mean, I'm not saying their lives were easy.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.880
I'm sure they all had their, you know, their problems to deal with.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.040
But the sense of community that was there and Fatima, who used to run

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.000
the the youth pavilion or manage the youth pavilion,

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.920
was just this amazing matriarch figure and had every single one of those young people.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.880
You know, they they did whatever she said.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.160
And mind you, I don't think I'd ever cross Fatima either.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.720
But, you know, it was this amazing sense.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.080
She knew them. She knew their family.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.240
She knew their problems. She knew their positive sides.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.160
And she would do everything to get them involved.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.800
And that real sense of, you know, this wasn't a scary community at all.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.240
It was just a very, very close knit community.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.240
And to be allowed for those few years to be almost a part of that community

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.520
was actually I think it's a bit of a privilege.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.240
You know, it's not very often you get to break into such a strong, strong community

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.680
and get to be a part of them for those for those few months.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.920
And, you know, I went to Pumps in Butan that I would never, ever dream of going into.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.640
Or since without their, you know, without their support,

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.440
I was going to say protection, but I'll use the word support still.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.880
Yeah. And, you know, and just to think that that there was,

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.240
you know, these communities are out there and there's actually

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.720
not nothing that's scary about them.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.680
But you got this perceived sense of threat or unknown.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.640
And, yeah, it really broke down some barriers for me about, you know, working

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.680
outside my comfort zone.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.040
Yes, I think Fatima's ultimate sanction was I'm going to go and tell your parents

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.400
because she could, you know, and they would listen to her and share that.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.520
Her concerns.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.560
I think she probably she threatened me that went to do whatever I was told.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.960
Dear, dear, dear.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.520
And obviously, Carnival Day itself is affected by the weather.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.440
I mean, in the period you were with Swicker, did we have one of those Carnival

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.880
Days where it was deluge or were you blessed by good weather on Carnival Day?

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.720
You know what?

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.000
I think one of them was wet and I'm not.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.080
I don't think it must have been too bad, because I'm not sure it even mattered.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.120
You've dried out now. That much.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.800
I remember certainly one or two beautiful, scorching hot Carnival Days,

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.080
which is, you know, a rarity in Cardiff on its own.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.400
But I'm trying to I think there was one where it rained quite heavily in the morning,

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.120
but maybe it actually had dried up by parade time.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.440
And I think as long as it had actually dried up by parade time,

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.240
everyone was so ecstatic that it stopped absolutely pouring down.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.080
I think a lot of.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.640
Yeah, a lot was forgiven for that.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.240
So, no, just just dry ones, I think.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.600
I think you were very lucky then.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.560
I think it was. Yes.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.440
2005, six and seven were the famous trilogy where we got completely soaked

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.960
from all day till the end of the day.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.560
In terms of carnival creations and costumes,

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.920
are there any that stick in your mind, if a particular fondness or?

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.160
Do you know what? I'm going to I'm going to sing out for the end of the year.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.920
I before I joined Swicker, I worked as a theatrical costumier.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.320
My mother owned Marigold Costumes, which was based in Bute Town.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.840
She did for many years and I worked there solidly during

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.120
university holidays and the summer holidays.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.520
And I got pretty proficient using a sewing machine.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.600
And then I joined the mass camp and I would come after my,

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.200
you know, nine to five at Swicker, I would go straight down to the mass camp.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.520
And there I was greeted with overlockers and I'd never, ever,

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.880
ever seen an overlocker before.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.480
And I've wanted one ever since.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.240
And I was put to work.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.520
So I'm going to ignore the feathers and the sequins.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.680
I don't care those because I made hundreds and hundreds

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.800
and hundreds of trousers and tunics,

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.120
the boring stuff that goes underneath all the beautiful base costume,

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.840
the base costumes. Exactly.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.680
And so I'm going to speak out for the base costumes.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.640
And I made these amazing trousers,

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.760
the ones that were just one solid piece of material.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.600
And you had to fold them in a special way.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.720
And they were amazing.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.240
Wrap around trousers. They're still, you know.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.040
Yeah, absolutely.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.160
One size fits pretty much everyone, give or take. Yes.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.880
Wrap around trousers, tunics and so I.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:39.800
But do you know what?

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.600
Did we actually chain you to the sewing machine?

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.920
Do some people claim that happened?

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.960
Yeah, I think those chains were, they were metaphorical, I think.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.680
I used to get self-inflicted.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.480
This would be one for the the the annals.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.840
I used to get self-inflicted eye infections,

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.280
because if you stay too long at the overlockers, the tiny fibres.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.600
Wow. I didn't know that.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.640
I don't know because I was there.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.280
I used to get down from about four and I'd finish my maths.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.560
Finished at ten. Yeah. Yeah.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.960
So it was that six solid hours being sat at the sewing machines.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.120
And I loved it, though.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.560
Were your lawyers being touch or? Yeah. Excellent.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.120
Yeah. Obviously, I was going to be an eye model.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.000
But yeah, it was it was.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.920
Yeah. But you know what?

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.880
That for me was fine because I was a paid member of staff, although technically

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.720
my my job did not extend to be going down to the mass camp every night.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.800
But nobody wants to do the boring base layers.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.160
Everyone wants to get the glue guns out and, you know, get creative.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.000
And I was like, no, let the community do that.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.720
That's what they're here for. Let me just.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.040
The hard slog, the hard slog.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.600
And that was absolutely fine for me, because, yeah, I'm more than happy.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.120
It's more than happy to do that kind of work so that people could have fun

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.880
with feathers and sequins.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.960
And did you ever get to

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.400
play a costume on Carnival Day yourself?

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.240
I've never, ever got to play.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.920
I know I feel very bad about that.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.520
No, don't. I have got the most beautiful array of high vis vests

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.640
and jackets, which I still own to this day.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.160
And I remember my first ever time

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.480
and it wasn't a carnival, it was when we were doing in Caerphilly.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.200
But I decided we needed I needed a proper coat because the vests

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.720
that we got away with in the summer for the carnivals wouldn't wouldn't work

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.360
for a cold

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.600
December winter's carnival.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.280
And I went out to one of these, I don't know, HSS, one of these,

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.480
you know, tool supply stores.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.200
Bought myself a beautiful high vis jacket, which I still have.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.720
And I'll never forget opening it.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.080
And there was a big, big warning sign that says if this jacket is not worn

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.360
done up, it is ineffective.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.920
And I love that this enormous full length

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.440
high vis jacket that nobody would see me in unless I did the zip up.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.360
No, I was quite happy with my swicker t shirt and my high vis vest.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.400
And yeah, that was my costume for my carnivals.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.840
I like the power, the power that high vis vest got you.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.680
I could stop traffic.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.760
I was up there stopping traffic, putting my arm out.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.640
People would stop.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.800
People wouldn't have done that if I was wearing feather and sequins.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.280
I, you know, I wanted the power, the power of high vis vest.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.720
As you mentioned, I mean, people, community participants came from all

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.760
walks of life and many different groups.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.480
Is there any individual group that sticks in your mind in that period?

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.200
I was always a bit of a feisty with all you ran in fear.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.200
No, no.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:33.960
From the room where they were.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.960
I don't think so. I was always quite.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.240
There are a couple of groups that I always had that kind of little bit

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.760
of jealousy about the drummers, the Samba Gallas.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.920
And there are a couple of other ones.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.240
They were just cool.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.400
They were just, you know, that ability to make those absolutely amazing

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.680
sounds and you didn't have to be.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.680
Well, from what I can say, you don't have to be an expert drummer,

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.880
but, you know, they had people from all different kind of levels

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.280
and they were always brilliant.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.160
But once I really had the proper jealousy about in my high vis jacket,

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:05.880
were, of course, the dancers who used to turn up and they used to practice

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:06.920
and they used to be in the morning.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:07.600
The weather was nice.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.560
They'd be out in the front of the youth pavilion and that kind of car parking area.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.280
They'd be practicing or inside if it was where fighting over what music needed

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.600
to be played so they could practice their dances and they just they were.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.640
They were beautiful.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.840
They were glamorous.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.080
They were, you know, they were fabulous dancers.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.720
Yeah, I quite, you know, in a different in a different world.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.400
I would like to be there. Yeah. Yeah.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.000
Quite right, too. Yeah.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.120
So ConCon has been and that's to some degree still is the flagship project for Swicker.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.800
But of course, as administrator for the company,

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.600
you know, number two in a hierarchy of two.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.960
We worked on a number of other different projects.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.760
I mean, any others come to mind as we're chatting?

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.480
I think favorite always will be a big favorite was when we did

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.480
the Myths, Minds and Memories up in Blind Avent.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.720
It was it was a really pivotal one.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.920
I think so many ways it was that first HLF grant for the Your Heritage Program.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:09.160
You know, the got the full amount of the grant and that allowed the artists

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.200
to do, you know, some lovely things.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.200
And again, it was that kind of breaking into such a close knit

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.160
community as Bliner.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.440
People are still astonished that I can find Bliner on a map so quickly

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.160
and drive them there should they wish, because, you know,

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.240
up and down the valleys roads to get to Bliner.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.440
And yeah, that was just an amazing project to be part of.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:34.160
I think it's such a small community, complete community involvement in one project.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.160
Got my DVD, although obviously I'm not a fan of the DVD.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.720
I've got my DVD, although I've still got my DVDs and carnivals as well.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.640
But, you know, I've still got it all.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.120
And every now and then I just clear out.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.040
And I thought, oh, yeah, I did get to hang on to those.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:51.200
I'm not saying I watch them every day, but I'm really proud of really proud of achieving.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.200
So, yeah, happy.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.560
That was a good one to remember.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.400
Actually, they all do.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.320
I mean, I think that's the whole point of what we did.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:02.280
I mean, I work now in a far larger organization.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.200
I work for the National Museum and we do projects here and there.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.960
But everything we did at Swicker,

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.760
there was such a big outcome after everything we did, which is, you know,

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.440
the whole point of it, you know, after every carnival, you'd get 100,

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:20.240
a thousand, two thousand people all there in costume, dancing, walking, drumming,

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.720
shaking, limping, however, you know, I like the limping.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.120
That was me, you know, through the carnival and even

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.840
we did the schools ones in Blinavon or we did the the big theatre production

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.640
in Blina or the carnivals in Kivili.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.120
There was always such a big outcome.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.160
There was a sense of achievement.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.520
It wasn't a sense of, OK, we did some workshops and they were great.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.880
OK, we're also doing that and that.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.160
It was such a at the time we were trying to be a small team.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.800
And, you know, what we put out was massive.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.440
And it's always used to have that kind of sense of achievement

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:59.560
when you're doing your kind of post carnival or post project

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.480
performance indicators.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.640
And then you can get to say, you know, how many people got involved?

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.760
Yeah, we can put, you know, a few thousand.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.080
How many people watch? Yeah, we can put tens of thousands.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.520
You know, it was that real sense of impact on every single thing we do.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.000
And there can't be very many

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.560
jobs in this field or, well, you know, certainly not in this field

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.520
where you get that really sense of kind of achievement and a massive,

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.320
massive outcome after every single project you do.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.600
And I think that's something to be very proud of.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.200
Talking to be very proud,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:36.080
I wish to proudly bestow you the verbal honour of Carnival Hero.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.360
Caroline Simmons, thank you very, very much.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.360
Thank you very much.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.680
And for those who don't know,

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.880
Baby Deleth has been sleeping ever so quietly during the interview.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.680
Thank you very much indeed for your carnival memories. Thank you.
