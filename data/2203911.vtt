00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
Life in a camp was nice. Food was provided and what not.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.800
And of course there were all Asian people and everything, most of them.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.800
And they want Indian food and everything.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.200
They wouldn't get used to with the roast dinners and everything.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.400
So well, camp head, she said, you know,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.000
we don't know how to cook that much Indian food.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.600
So will there be anybody?

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:36.600
So my brother, he was looking after all the like voluntary looking after people.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.400
So he asked my mum, Ali by his wife, you know, Karima,

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:51.000
and a few ladies, you know, and they say, yeah, we are ready to cook, you know, no problem, you see.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.600
We have to get the stuff and everything.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.400
So my brother said to the head of that camp, you know,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.400
and he said, yeah, you give me the list, we will go and get it, you know.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.600
So they brought the stuff and everything and all the ladies gathered up, you know, and started cooking.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.800
Till November, I think end of November,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.600
because we were told that there will be a lot of snow and everything and it will be very cold.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.800
So, of course, there was a house coming into the Scotland.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:38.200
It was a very, it was a, it was a new, new place was built up, you see.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.800
And we agreed, you know, just to be independent, you know, and go to the Scotland, you know,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.200
doesn't matter, you see, as long as we have got our own things and everything to do.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:59.800
And we were happy to go, you see, but unfortunately, we couldn't stay there long,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.800
because my mom was very ill over there because she was very cold.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.400
And I was working in a Max and Spencer in a, as a machinist.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.600
And I had to give up my job, you see, because my mom was,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.800
we wanted to move my mom into the warmer country.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.200
So we decided to go to either Leicester or Birmingham.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.200
So we decided to go to Birmingham.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.800
We got a house over there, so we exchanged it.
