Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Interviewee,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Alvaro Mondo Celestialo.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The location of the interview is the Swicker office

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and the date today is the 5th of October 2015.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Ray, when do you recall first meeting me and Swicker Carnival?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.000
My recollection of meeting you was 1990, 1991.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I can always remember going to Channelview in that little office

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that you were sharing with...

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Cardiff Arts Marketing, I think. Yes, yes.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
That's when I first met you, was up in that little office.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
That's smashing. I remember in early July 1990

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
being invited to a meeting by key movers and shakers in the Bute Town,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the Docks community, to decide whether or not, even at this late stage,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
there should be a carnival, a Bute Town carnival for 1990.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And I was in a lucky position of being able to say,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
in terms of a parade, Swicker can provide.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We had the first ever Cardiff Mars Carnival that year

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and over half the participants, all of whom were aged 14 and under,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
were from the Bute Town area.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And if there were to be a carnival, I remember Swicker offering

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
to remount at no cost to the Bute Town carnival the parade.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And as I recall, you were in that meeting, always a voice of positivity

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and we can and the rest of it.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
But of course the Bute Town carnival happened in 1990

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and Swicker effectively provided the parade,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
which led us to our cunning plan, wasn't it?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
It was.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
After you Ray, what was the cunning plan?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Well, the plan was to sort of broaden it, actually to broaden it,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and that's where Cardiff Bay Development Company came in,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
which they were very, very helpful.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I must agree, you could agree on that,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
because they did a wonderful job of funding.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Absolutely. So back in the day, of course, the docks of detail...

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The 1990 carnival was not... it was good, it was very good actually,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but I think both you and both the carnival, the Bute Town carnival,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
were based on the learning curve to try to improve it,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
which was, it did improve, very much so, it did very much improve.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
But then 1991, that was when Cardiff Bay,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
it was Cardiff Bay Development Corporation's carnival.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Yes. So CBDC, as it was known, the acronym,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
we were able to persuade them, so in 1991, two separate carnivals,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
the Cardiff Maast carnival, run by Swickert,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and the Bute Town carnival, run by the Bute Town carnival committee,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and particularly, well you were in the chair, weren't you?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Yes, but I didn't have...

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
So you spent the whole time at the community centre and everything.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Yes, I was chairman at that particular time,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
but I didn't have that much input into the carnival itself,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
because the carnival committee itself was running it,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
well it was running it, you know, so,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and they said both the Bute Town community centre,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
carnival committee and Swickert sort of merged together,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
which was, I was hoping that there would be a very good collaboration

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
between the two of us.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Yes.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
But unfortunately, it didn't work out that way.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Well, I think what we can say to future generations is that in 1991,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
effectively, Swickert was acting as producers for a joint carnival,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Swickert's always been keen to be open to everybody on a city-wide basis,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and of course, the remit of the Bute Town carnival was quite rightly

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
to celebrate the Docks community and its heritage and its future in particular,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
but we were able to bridge those for one year,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and I was, you know, very much at the forefront of persuading CBDC

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
to invest in this new vision, a city-wide carnival,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
but one based in and around Bute Town, so they were first among equals,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and CBDC came up with a funding line of Â£25,000,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
which back in those days was reasonable,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I mean, there was certainly obviously a multi-billion pound operation,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
to put it mildly, and in 1991, for one year only,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
we were able to put both carnivals together

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and effectively bring it off and produce the biggest and best.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Well, it wasn't the best at that particular time.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Absolutely, yes, in that era, of course,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
because Bute Town Carnival has got a very different era.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Well, it over, and then after that, 1991,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
then Bute Town Carnival committee sort of disappeared.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
There was a slow, gradual decline,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and the two carnivals separated and went their separate ways, as it were.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Which was, I thought, at that particular time, which was wrong,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
I didn't like the idea of the partnership parting.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
No, looking back, I mean, we had a moment there,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and we certainly have shown that it could work.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I suppose if we could get back in time,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
I think that's probably a decision both of us would like to change.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Yes, looking back in retrospect, yes, it would be fine.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Perhaps we wouldn't be in the position that we're in today.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
No, precisely, you just can't say.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Obviously, you and your personal history is closely linked to the DOCS community,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and I wonder if you care to tell us a bit about,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and also obviously your roots in terms of Cape Verde.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Can you tell us a bit about your background?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Yes, both my parents were from Cape Verde.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:44.000
My mother came over just before the end of the 1800s, 1890s.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
She came over.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
The people who brought my mother over from Cape Verde

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
was the Millers of Millers and Corry, the coal people.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Wow.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
She lived in Bristol.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
That's where they came, when they came back from Cape Verde.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
They lived in Bath, Bristol.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Yes, yes.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
But then she came into Cardiff because her friend,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:23.000
who was also brought over by the, I don't say the Millers and Corry company,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000
but the persons who worked for them, which was the, the family name was Rice.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And they brought her over, and she had a shop in Angelina Street.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000
It's called Mrs. Lopes, and it was renowned for the parrot that was hanging out there.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
She kept in the shop, you know, and everybody knows Mrs. Lopes.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
They say Mrs. Lopes, and they always say, mention the parrot.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Quite a local character.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And that's how she met my father, because my father, being a seaman,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
he was in and out of Cardiff.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:15.000
I have a discharge book of my father's, which was a continuation of a discharge book.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And the first date in that discharge book was 1902.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:28.000
So obviously he must have been back and forth on the ships before 1902, you know,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
which I found to be very interesting, you know.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Anyway, they met, they got married, and they settled down in Sapphire Street,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
34 Sapphire Street, and that's where the family home.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
That was the family home.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
We did move once to Loudoun Square.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And that would be how long in terms of distance from one to another?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
This was not a...

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Oh no, it was only about 300, 400 yards.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I was about to say.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
It was, I'd say, two streets away.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Two streets away, that sounds right.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
We only stayed there for one night, that whole night,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and we could move back down into our old family home.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
For what reasons, I don't know, because I was only speaking.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
No, no, that's how interesting.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:20.000
But that's where my parents, they were from the island of Santa Clara.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Right. And of course, the Bute Island community had a Cape Verde society.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Tell us a bit about that.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Society, well, the society was formed in 1987.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Right.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And that was the year that the Cape Verdes had their independence from Portugal.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Wow.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
In July 5th, 1987.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
As late as that, that's incredible when you think about it, isn't it?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Yeah.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And have you had a chance to ever visit?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
I have not visited.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Unfortunately, I have not visited.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
My son has been.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Right. And what did he report back?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
What did he make of it?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Well, he went, because now the islands are being tourist, made for tourists now.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Yeah.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
So the island he went to, which was Boa Vista, it's all tourist, you know.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Right, right. Tourist.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
I've said, if you want to go, is to go to St. Vincent itself,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
because that is not the island of St. Vincent.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Absolutely.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Mindello is the capital of St. Vincent.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
It's not the capital of the Cape Verde Islands.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Interesting.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And the capital of Cape Verde Islands is on Santiago, a place called Praia.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Well, I've learned a lot about geography in a short period of time there.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
It's the capital. That's where the government is seated.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Got it. Got it. Got it.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Returning to Cardiff Carnival, obviously you've been on the swicker board of management

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
for a very long time and always been incredibly supportive and always been positive.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And I have to say for the record, of course, you know, this is an audio interview,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
but once again, Ray is the most smartly dressed man in team swicker.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
He's managed to do that since we first met in 1991.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
I hate to add that whilst I'm not looking too scruffy, I...

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
No, no, no, no.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
He's always been the smartest dresser in the team.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Well, and that, as I say, and that goes back to the Cape Verde...

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
the Cape Verde community.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
The men, the seamen, when they're on the ship, fair enough, they're in their working clothes.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
But when they come aboard, come ashore, they dress.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
They dress.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And that's where it's... that's basically where it's...

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Well, you're carrying on the tradition, I have to say.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
I'm very proud to do so.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
No, absolutely.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Even though I do sometimes, people do keep mentioning the fact that,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
oh, you're looking smart.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
It's because you are looking smart.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
As I say, I tell them, I said, I can't do nothing else.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
That's the way I was brought up and that's the way I am.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
So you've got to take me, take it or leave it.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
It's a good look, yeah, man.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
You're not going to have, Ray, tracky bottoms, not in this...

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
No.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Your face has a sense of it.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Nothing is tracky bottoms.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Are the right people?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
No, absolutely.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
So you've seen many, many carnivals, Newtown carnivals, Cardiff carnivals.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Are there any particular costumes or moments or music or...

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
What sticks in the memory?

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
What sort of highlights would you like to just...

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:39.000
What sticks in my memory is the fact that it was the West Indian music.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Trinidad, Calypsos, Reggae, Calypsos more so than...

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
At the beginning, Calypsos was the...

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
That was the thing.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And then Reggae, because my sister, one of my sisters,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
she married a Trinidadian and lived over in Trinidad.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Wow. Port of Spain.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Well, San Fernando.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And the train is still there.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
The last train is still there, is it?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
It is still there, yes.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And that's what always sticks in my mind.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
When you say carnival, I automatically can hear that music going.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Yes, absolutely.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
I remember only thinking, was there a period when she came over to Cardiff

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
and she saw the carnival?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Yes.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
What was her impression of what we were doing in Cardiff?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
She was comparing it to the carnival in Trinidad and Port of Spain.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Which is one of the greatest carnivals in the world.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And she said it was all right, but she said it doesn't come up to what we're doing in Port of Spain.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
I was in San Fernando, you know.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
No, no, no.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
She enjoyed it.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Absolutely.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
She enjoyed it, but...

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
No, she didn't quite...

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
She enjoyed it.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
I think she said it just to be polite.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
So you don't...

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
I'm not knocking the carnival as much.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Sheer scale of what happens in Trinidad.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
It's amazing.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
I wish I could have been over there, but I wish I could have been over there

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
while the carnival is being prepared because that's...

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Yes, the whole carnival season in the West Indies, particularly in Trinidad, as you say.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
The home of the mask.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Yes.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
At this point, I'd like to wind up proceedings and say, for the record and for posterity,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
many thanks for the interview.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
But equally, it's not a bankable honour and it's largely invisible,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000
but I wish to make the award of Carnival Hero to Ray Celestiano.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
I'd like to thank him for all his help and support and goodwill over many, many years.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Once again, Ray, you're a carnival hero.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Thank you very much indeed.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Thank you very much.
