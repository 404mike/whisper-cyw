00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:20.360
discussed in the sort of like a committee level and it became together

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:29.440
in 1982 okay and the name was given Wales Pooja committee and the Wales

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:37.740
Pooja committee was a was recognized in 1982 lovely and was it in 1982 that it

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.220
dr. Nath another thing since you have been involved with the poojas since 1981

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.820
what has your role been over the years have you been involved actively with the

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:03.900
Pooja committee have been doing various chores with the Pooja committee yes

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.260
gradually I was sucked into the Wales Pooja committee and started becoming an

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.540
active member and doing lots of things like you know kind of like as that as

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.700
any other committee as well as we were involved in small little jobs like

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:33.020
cooking and you know the arrangement of the stage and decorations and managing

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.820
other things I as I understand you were also part of the management you had you

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.140
held certain roles in the community like being the chairperson and being a

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:53.260
secretary yes I was chairperson I did the job of secretary he was treasurer

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:03.780
and what else he was I was an active member in a way so that means there was

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:11.220
there has to be a form of election to get a result yes yes we always every

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.660
year we used to have an election and with the proper way as we do for the

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.660
and people the members who had selected for the executive committee okay and

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:31.260
they were elected and they used to do their job when was the first big change

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:40.020
that you noticed in which sense you know the overall function in the pooja

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:53.020
creating Durga you know participating in a big way almost nationally I think we

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:00.340
were known nationally when we started making our first Durga project or Durga

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:12.460
image with two artists from India came and then it was known to quite a lot of

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:19.900
people and the committees all over UK were there other things you did to put

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:27.220
forward or present WPC into the image of the normal people of Cardiff or

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:39.540
South Wales yes I think we participated in in London but in a function which was

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:49.060
organized by the Alan the wager and we had a sort of a like a couple of items

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:58.580
performed by the Wales committee members all right that's interesting but I thought

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:05.500
I've heard that you people participated in in functions to involve the people of

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:17.380
Wales like certain oh yes yes we did three mailers since the 1990s Dr. Nath

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:27.260
what is a mailer mailer is a sort of a like a we arrange it for a day it's for the

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:34.460
general public job we with all the Indian culture is shown and the food and dance

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:40.540
and dramas and all the shops and and people are all invited and it was a

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.740
free entrance and people came in they enjoyed the food they enjoyed the

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:52.060
cultural functions and it was a very successful lovely do you think the

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:57.620
profile of Westwood a committee has grown over the years yes yes it has do

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:03.020
you have a permanent place where you do your functions we haven't got a

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:09.860
permanent place of our own what you can I interrupt here listen dr. Nath why

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.660
since this function this this committee has been growing over the years since

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:23.500
19 the early 80s why haven't you got a place of your own it's very difficult to

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:33.060
answer that because it involves funding it needs more manpower and mainly the

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:40.420
funding was the reason for that yes and if we get funding in future probably

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.900
have our own place would you think you may be able to sustain a place of your

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:52.660
own yes we can okay we are capable people lovely good thank you very much

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.220
Dr. Nath thank you
