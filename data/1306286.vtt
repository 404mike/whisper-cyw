00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is chapter 22 in our continuing story that follows on from the race riots of 1919 in Wales and across the rest of England.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Chapter 22. India, the beginning of the collapse of empire.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Quote from Mahatma Gandhi.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.000
In 1960 the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Harold Milk Millen, delivered a famous speech known as the Wind of Change.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In that speech he said,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Many countries there of different races and civilisation pressed their claim to an independent national life.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Today the same thing is happening in Africa.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
In different places it may take different forms, but it is happening everywhere.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The wind of change is blowing through the continent.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Whether we like it or not, this growth of national consciousness is a political fact.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We must accept it as a fact.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Now in India there were numerous uprisings and conflicts that erupted over the course of the centuries, the centuries long British occupation.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:49.000
But it wasn't until Mahandas Mahatma Gandhi's social efforts began, beginning in India from 1915 to 1920 and onward,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
that a popular vision for India began to spread amongst ordinary Indians.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000
At the time Gandhi had only recently returned from South Africa, where he had stayed for more than 20 years.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:10.000
As the voice and conscience of thousands of racially subjugated Indians upon his return to India,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Gandhi advocated for Indians to boycott British institutions and products in a non-violent way.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
This movement was ultimately known as Swadeshi.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
India suffered a significant cost during World War I.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Over one million Indian troops served overseas, of whom 62,000 at least died and another 67,000 were wounded.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:49.000
In total at least 74,187 Indian soldiers died during World War I.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
In World War I the Indian army fought against the German Empire in Germany,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Germany East Africa I should say, and on the Western Front.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Indian men were also a significant part of Mercantile Marine, later to be called the Merchant Navy.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Unfortunately we cannot say how many died, many of those died because the British government destroyed those records after the war.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
During the First World War these seamen replaced British mariners recruited into the Royal Navy.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:34.000
The Laskers, which is what Indian merchant seamen were first known as and that spread to other seamen,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
were paid a fraction of white cruise wages.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And along with other overseas sailors such as African and Caribbean people suffered harsh treatment.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Received inferior rations and mostly worked in cramped, hot, badly ventilated areas below deck.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:04.000
The Laskers, as I said, slang for Indian seamen, comprised an estimated 17.5% of mariners on British registered ships.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Some 51,000 men, according to Historic England.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.000
There is a monument erected by the shipping companies and mercantile community of Calcutta

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:29.000
to the memory of 896 seamen of Bengal, Assam and Upper India who lost their lives in the service to the British Empire in the Great War of 1914-18.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
The SS Maloa is an example.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
It was a requisitioned liner carrying military and civilian passengers en route to Bombay.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.000
It sank, causing the death of 122 passengers, 85 Lasker crew.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
It was the greatest single loss of Indian merchant seamen in the war.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.000
The names of 63 of those are remembered at the Commonwealth War Grades Commission Bombay Memorial.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:09.000
This memorial commemorates 1708 members of the Indian Merchant Service,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:24.000
which was separate from the UK Merchant Navy, and a further 498 from the Royal Indian Marine, the Royal Navy and the Mercantile Marine Reserve.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So we don't know the numbers of Indians at sea who died, but we know it was significant.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Repatriation was sought after the war, but it wasn't effective.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:47.000
The local councils, the police, the government, once the merchant seamen in particular,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.000
but the others from the Empire had served their purpose in World War I, wanted them to go home.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000
So they sought to repatriate, but it wasn't effective. Some had families.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And so a new measure was introduced that required black workers to provide documentary proof of British nationality.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:18.000
A requirement that was impossible for thousands of seafarers born in British colonial Africa, the Caribbean, Middle East, India and Malaysia.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Many of which could not write.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:36.000
This practice was subsequently incorporated into the special restriction Coloured Seamen Order in 1925, described as the whitewashing of Britain.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.000
The order set the policy direction of the British government with regard to black workers, far beyond that time period.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
This group of merchant seamen and those from the armed forces that had fought for the Empire,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:59.000
but came home to exactly the same conditions they had left, contribute to an angry India and an angry British Empire.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
That significantly diluted the non-violent nature of Gandhi's revolution.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Merchant seamen, for example, from the Punjab, were largely Muslims and they were largely underclass within the class system, some even being untouchables.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Furthermore, the behaviour of the British government's local representatives became more punitive after the war because of their fear of uprising.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:39.000
One major event that directly affected Sikhs and Muslims in particular is still a stain on their history and helped to destroy Empire.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:49.000
The Jallinwalabagh Massacre, also known as the Amritsar Massacre, took place on the 13th of April 1919.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:02.000
When Acting Brigadier General Reginald Dyer ordered troops of the British Army to fire their rifles into a crowd of unarmed civilians in Jallinwalabagh,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:11.000
killing at least 400 people, including men and women, over 1,000 people were injured.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Those people were on a peaceful, mainly religious march.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:27.000
There is a plaque in Amritsar which sums it up.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Notice, this place is saturated with the blood of thousands of Indian patriots who were martyred in a non-violent struggle to free India from British domination.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
General Dyer and the British Army opened fire here on unarmed people.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Jallinwalabagh is thus an everlasting symbol of non-violent and peaceful struggle for freedom of Indian people and the tyranny of the British.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.000
India's actions led the movement to end the British Empire that was to conclude in its collapse after World War II.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Hence the Wind of Change speech. But Africa, China, the Caribbean and the Middle East soon followed India.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:24.000
The race riots and the behaviour of government was a part of a turning point in history, as Lord Milner predicted.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
This is a quote from Peter Fryer, 1984, The Staying Power book.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:43.000
The Colonial Secretary Lord Milner pointed out that many of the black men attacked in the riots had served in the Army, Navy and Merchant Service during the war and bitterly resented the ingratitude shown in the attacks.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:53.000
He feared the effect their return to the colonies would have on attitudes to white minorities there and his fears were soon justified.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.000
It's quite true that racial feeling is rising in World War I, as elsewhere the causes are many.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:22.000
The participation of coloured men in the war, slights and insults received by them mainly from Dominion troops on account of their colour, the USA race troubles, Liverpool and Cardiff riots and in addition the general unrest all over the world.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000
I think the trouble is a fact to be faced and there is no special remedy for it.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:45.000
We can provide against disorder, improve conditions and be careful over questions of race, but nothing we can do will alter the fact that the black man has begun to think and feel himself as good as the white.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Gilbert Grindle, later to be Sir Gilbert Grindle, 22nd October 1919, Colonial Office Memo.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:16.000
So the race riots in 1919 in their own way had a longer lasting effect in a few days in June and led to a group of people returning unhappy, angry and a tidal wave of change across the empire.
