00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040
Anything in particular stand out from the ceremony?

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.760
I think the impressive part of that was the grandeur of it all.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:19.840
And going into the Abbey and all the wonderful, wonderful architecture around,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.120
which is an opportunity to see inside these places,

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.480
apart from seeing members of the Royal Family and all the dignitaries that were there.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.760
Yes, quite an inspiring...

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.560
Well, it gave an opportunity for people who lived way out in the country,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.200
far enough removed from London, to enter into the spirit of it all.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:55.920
And yes, the media helped to broaden our outlook on things like that and to give us that interest.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.600
Were there things going on in the community, street parties or something like that?

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.440
Yes, possibly there were one or two street parties, but very few.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.160
I think small street parties. There were one or two.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.960
We didn't have a street party in this little area,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.120
though we did have a few children here, but we didn't.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.760
But I think some of the streets in Wrexham possibly did that more than we did in the village here.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.560
I can't really remember a street party in Brumbow, ever.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.200
You know, for any event.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.160
But I'm not saying that it didn't take place, but I think had it, I would have been aware of it.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.320
As a Welsh woman, what did the ceremony mean to you?

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.200
The coronation of the Queen.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.840
For me as a Welsh person, I think you get a sense of pride, obviously.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.600
She was a young lady, wasn't she? Very young, and it was sort of thrust upon her,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.280
sooner than she had anticipated, obviously.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.720
But quite a remarkable lady, because she's continued now well into her 80s, hasn't she?

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.120
And in my opinion, she's done a remarkable, remarkable job.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.240
So we just look forward to the future and hope that the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:36.240
younger generations will be able to emulate her shining example, I think, of how she's led the country.
