00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
Can you talk a little bit about the work you've been doing with the Trust this year? Because

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.520
of Covid, it's sort of developed, hasn't it, before we went into our latest lockdown of course, but

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:23.360
your Tuesday gatherings for example? Our Tuesday groups are really the practical fieldwork groups,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:33.680
which are trying to find evidential remains of long period of occupation here.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.480
The original sites that we've chosen to do this for one reason or another were not available to us,

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.760
and we've been very lucky to build a relationship with the landowners at Oppenheim here,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:56.160
right up at the head of the valley, where there is huge amounts of evidence to be interpreted.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.440
We were lucky there, because much of the land has largely escaped modern agricultural practice,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:12.880
which was to deep plough, improve, fertilise, develop the grassland or crop land in some areas.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.800
But by doing deep cultivation like that, any surface remains are ploughed out.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:33.520
And we are lucky then, as I said, we have been able to find remains of boundaries, farmsteads,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.120
which would certainly date back to medieval times and the time of the Abbey.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.440
So that's a great excitement. So we're looking at long hot sites, so we're looking at

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:54.640
low banks, which indicate very early field systems. And our colleague Julian

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.520
Ravist is very accomplished with the drone surveys, which have revealed huge amounts of

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.360
um, deep landscape features, which you don't necessarily see at ground level.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.800
The ideal time for doing the sort of work we're doing actually is in the winter,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:22.400
because the bracken is gone, and the sun is at a low angle in the sky, and it will illuminate

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.320
the surface in a very different way. It's been fantastic how it's in the snow over the last few

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:37.600
days, but the snow too is revealing shadow patterns, which indicate relatively low

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.040
features in the landscape, which you don't see by eye as you're just moving around.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.000
But just jump out at you. So yes, there's lots going on there. And within that, we've been able

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.520
to engage a lot of interest locally, some from our team or local people, some from further away.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.560
And we're also developing links with

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.400
with

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:14.240
an archaeologist, Vic Cardo, who lives over at Nantlas, who's done a lot of work

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:22.560
on the Owen Valley and the Cliovan Valley, and can bring experience, which shows a similar sort

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.800
of passion to the uplifts we're finding here, and all sorts of exciting things.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.800
What looks like a deep ditch in the landscape is in fact was a sort of runoff of getting the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.440
sheep up onto the hills, having watered them in the river. One man put the sheep in this rather deep

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:52.400
gully and just drive them straight up to the top of the hill without any other help.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.480
And that's a very interesting farming technique. And at the moment we're looking for

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:08.480
hazel sites and have also the summer farms of the farms lower down in the valley. So we would be up

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:15.600
for relatively short periods, live temporarily on the hill, milk the cattle, cattle are important

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:22.960
in medieval times, make their cheeses, send them back down, and then eventually by early September

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.440
maybe back down in the main farm. So yes, lots going on there and still a lot, lot to be found.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.280
We're looking at the moment at some cairns on the top of the Camilla bank, and of course it is

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.920
an ancient landscape. You always have to remember that there was somebody in the landscape before

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.720
whoever's there now. So when the monks came here there were people before them and before them and

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:57.280
before them. And the Neolithic remains just encircled from here really. If you go up onto the

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:05.840
garn, where you've got to garn, burial mound, there are some what looked like remains of some

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.240
burial mounds actually on the Camilla bank and then round onto the Camilla hill. They're just

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:21.840
one after the other because they tended to bury within sight of a previous burial whatever. So

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:30.240
history over thousands of years is revealing itself and the Tuesday group has been fantastic

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.160
and they've worked very hard at doing the donkey work associated with the period which is

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:43.520
actually revealing the footings of early farm steps at

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.360
Gilemon, Granacterium, which disappeared as a farm back in the 1860s when the land above it was

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:58.560
enclosed. And two sites have come on itself, one where an obvious house was until

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:05.520
probably occupied until about 1880. But just adjacent to that I've got my eye on another

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.440
platform site which we haven't done much work on but to measure it. But I think that could be

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:18.320
an earlier and certainly medieval location of a farmstead and it would have been a timber

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:24.720
built house. You wouldn't find any remains of it. But under the surface there is obvious paving

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:33.520
paving, store stones laid down as paving. So what that holds remains to be seen.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.840
There's always something else to find out.
