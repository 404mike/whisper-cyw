00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760
My name is Vicki MacDonald and I'm at Holy Trinity Church during the longest yarn.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:13.120
I'm with Roger Goldsmith who was a child during the war and has got some memories of his childhood.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.480
And if you tell me first, Roger, where did you live?

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.960
In New York, on Trent Nottinghamshire.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.000
So you were brought up in the early years, you were about seven when the war broke out?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.080
Yes, yes, it was just before I was born on 11th December and the war of course broke out at the beginning of September.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.360
So tell me about your memories, did your father go and did he join up?

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.720
No, he was a GP.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.400
So he was a reserved occupation, so he stayed at home.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:59.760
He worked at the hospital and around New York.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.840
So you were very young, but did you go to school during the war?

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:15.280
Because the war broke out, we were three of us, I had a twin brother and my sister was three years older.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:32.320
And we were all sent off to, well my brother and I were kept together, we went to a school which was in Derbyshire, a boarding school.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.560
So you were quite young when you were sent to the boarding school in Derbyshire?

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.360
Yes, well coming up to 70 years old.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.360
So your father was quite young.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.960
Do you have memories of that? Was it good, bad?

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.960
It was fine, I had a very interesting life.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:02:02.560
And I will remember the war because looking back it seems extraordinary, but there was a newspaper every day,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:11.440
News Chronicle it was called, and I read that every day to see what was happening.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.280
It was in the school, it was put up on boards so you could read it.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:26.560
And there must have been one or two other newspapers as well, but I always kept to the News Chronicle, it was one source of paper at that time.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.600
So for you the war was happening somewhere else, but there was a lot of bombing in the Midlands.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.640
Did that affect you when you were at school?

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:48.640
No, it was not that part of it. We did have bombing and I will remember the two planes that came over and dropped bombs on the factory,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.440
which was really very close to us, which produced ball bearings.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.960
And that was the only factory in the country that produced these things.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.400
So did they rebuild the factory fairly quickly and get it going again then?

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:16.400
I don't know the details of it and I haven't come across any history of that because the planes came over very slowly

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:27.200
and I just happened to look out of the kitchen window and I dropped the bombs on this factory, which was really quite close to where we lived.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.200
But it missed your playing fields?

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.920
Sorry?

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.920
It missed the school's playing fields?

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:40.720
Oh no, by the way. Yes, at that time it happened to be home. I suppose it was still quite young, must have been, yes, at seven.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:50.720
And it hadn't been settled down properly in a boarding school, that happened a bit late.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:58.240
So your father survived the war, your parents, everything, and you came out of the war sort of unscathed?

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.440
Oh yes.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.440
So do you remember being short of food?

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.160
Well, I remember, well remember rationing.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:20.160
My mother was very big in doing a lot for the, there were a lot of soldiers and air force people around New York

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.160
because it was on the East Coast and fairly close.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:42.880
At the church, he did a lot there and my mother worked in the canteen where the soldiers and so on came every afternoon.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.880
At least a bun and tea, didn't they, I hear from other people?

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.880
That sort of a thing.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.600
Your mother did her work as well, was it perhaps the WRVS or was it NAFI?

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:05.600
I thought it was the WVS, the voluntary service, yes, it must have been.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.600
So it all passed fairly smoothly, did you have a gas mask, were you issued with gas masks?

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.600
Oh yes, yes, yes.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.600
Did you have a Mickey Mouse one?

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.600
I never heard of it.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.320
Well there were some that were issued with Mickey Mouse noses apparently.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.320
Oh really? I certainly don't remember that.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:42.320
But yes, the sirens would go for something because the Germans were obviously flying around.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:53.040
Our house was a big house where we had a big cellar so we would all go down there.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:05.040
And when the actual bombing took place, it was one o'clock in the afternoon, so we weren't anywhere near the cellar.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:13.760
So it just so happened I looked out of the window and there were two bombs dropping on the ball bearing factories.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.760
Oh well listen, thank you so much, they're lovely memories and I'm delighted to have met you.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.760
Thank you.
