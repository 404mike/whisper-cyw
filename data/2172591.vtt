00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.540
Hello, I'm Chandrika Joshi and it's 28th of March 2024 today. I've come to Ilford in London

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:23.920
to talk to Anil Pabari who also came from Uganda in 1972 and he is the son of Indu Ben

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.920
Pabari.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.920
Hello.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.920
Hi Anil.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.920
Hi.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.480
So tell me, how old were you? Do you remember Uganda at all?

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.480
Very well.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.920
Yeah, tell me about it. What was life like?

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:47.160
Well, we were just happy-go-lucky. You know, there we were just sort of no stress, just

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.760
playing outside. Yeah. Obviously no toys to play. We just sort of kids were just playing

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.760
outside.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.760
Oh, right. You found your own games.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.760
We found our own games with people around us. Obviously we had our own friends.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.760
And you were in Saroti, yeah?

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:11.360
Yeah, Saroti. The only problem now is that keeping in touch with all the friends we missed.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.880
Oh, right. All the people you missed.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.040
Although I have kept in touch with a few, but it's been a long time.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.040
Yeah. Do you remember when you were expelled?

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.040
Yes.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.040
What was it like for you when you heard that you have to leave?

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:33.680
Initially, I didn't understand. But then when we started packing, I think that bit of trauma

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.400
was there when we saw my friends just moving away. I remember that bit.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.400
Yeah. So one minute they were there and the next they were gone.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.800
And then next they were all gone and then we were moving as well. And actually the journey

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.560
from Saroti to Kampala, we felt it. I felt it.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.560
Yeah.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.560
I remember.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.560
Was it scary a little bit?

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.560
It was scary a little bit. Because at that time I still remember the army in between.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.280
Yeah. The checkpoints.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.280
The checkpoints and the army. The army lorries, yeah?

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.280
But luckily we managed to get to Kampala.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.280
Yeah.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.760
But obviously didn't understand why, for what reason.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.760
Yeah.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.760
Yeah.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.760
Was there any excitement at all?

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.760
Not really. Not really.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.760
Because the idea of coming to London, that thought wasn't there yet.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.760
No.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.760
Yeah. It wasn't there yet.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.240
Do you remember roughly, sort of, were you travelling at daytime or evening?

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.240
Yeah. I think it was evening time.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.240
Evening time.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.240
Yeah. I think it was evening time.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.240
And your flights came to which airport?

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.240
I think it was Stansted.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.240
Stansted. Yeah.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.240
Stansted.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.240
And what happened? Was it at night you came to Stansted or daytime?

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.240
So early morning.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.240
Early morning.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.240
Early morning. Yeah.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.240
Do you remember that at all or not really?

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.720
A little bit.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.720
Okay.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.720
Obviously because it was slightly darker and it was cold.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.720
It was cold.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.720
It was cold.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.720
Yeah.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.720
You know, just remember October.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.720
Yeah.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.720
Yeah. And it was cold.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.720
Yeah.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.720
And then that's when you feel, oh, it's supposed to be the winter here.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.720
Yeah.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.720
Yeah. It was cold.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.720
Yeah.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.720
And...

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.720
What else did you feel?

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.720
Because we never felt cold enough in Saroti.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.720
No. No.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.720
Yeah.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.200
The temperature was the same every single day.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.200
Exactly.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.200
Yeah. Yeah.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.200
Yeah.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.200
You know, if we drained in Saroti, yeah, you're okay for a while.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.200
And then hot again.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.200
Yeah.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.200
So what happened after Stansted airport?

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.200
You see, I remember going on a coach.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.200
Uh-huh.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:05.200
And you went to a place, an army barracks called in Honington.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.200
Honington.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.200
In Devon.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.200
Yeah. Okay.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.680
It was a long...

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.680
Yeah.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.680
It was a long journey.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.680
Yeah.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.680
I still remember it was a long, long journey.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.680
Yeah.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.680
Yeah.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.680
Obviously, half-time, we would just sleep because of the journey itself.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.680
Yeah.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.680
Yeah.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.680
And sort of...

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.680
Then all I remember, we were just put in a...

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.680
Like army barracks was just like a hut.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.680
Mm.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.680
Yeah.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.680
Mm.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.680
And we would just stay and sort of...

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.160
What was the food like and day-to-day life in the camp like?

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.160
It was like just try to make new friends again.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.160
Oh, my gosh.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.160
Yeah.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.160
Just trying to understand.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160
Plus, obviously, don't forget, it was very cold.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.160
Yeah.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.160
It was still winter time.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.160
Yeah.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.160
It was very cold.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.160
Yeah.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.160
Yeah.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.160
Yeah.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.160
Yeah.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.160
Yeah.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.160
Yeah.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.160
That was me.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.160
Ah.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.640
Yeah.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.640
It was just like helping out.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.640
Helping out.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.640
Helping out.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.640
Yeah.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.640
Helping out.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.640
Yeah.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.640
One volunteer there.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.640
One volunteer.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.640
And you already started helping out.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.640
Yeah.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.640
Just helping out.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.640
Yeah.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.640
I mean, just...

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.640
So the older people who couldn't leave their huts, you would take food over for them.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.640
Yeah.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.640
It was just the food.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.640
That's right.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.640
Yeah.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.640
Was there a school in Huntington camp?

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.640
Was there a little school there?

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.640
That...

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.640
I can't remember that much.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.640
Yeah.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.640
Yeah.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.640
Because you were just too busy.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.640
Yeah.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.640
Yeah.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.640
Yeah.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.120
And also we didn't stay that long.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.120
It was just a few months.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.120
And where did you go from there?

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.120
Before that, then they said we had to go to a place in North Wales.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.120
Okay.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.120
An area called...

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.120
Tonton.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.120
Something like that.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.120
I always took a taxi.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.120
Yeah.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.120
Yeah.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.120
Yeah.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.120
And I don't know why.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.120
I didn't understand the reason.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.120
You don't know why you were moved.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.120
Yeah.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.120
I don't know why.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.120
I don't know why.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.120
I don't know why.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.120
I don't know why.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.120
I don't know why.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.120
I don't know why.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.120
I don't know why.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.120
I don't know why.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.120
I don't know why.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.120
I don't know why.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.600
Yeah.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.600
Yeah.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.600
Okay.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.600
So there was North Wales.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.600
Again a long journey.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.600
Yeah.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.600
Again, cold.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.600
Cold, yeah.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.600
What did you think of that camp?

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.600
The North Walesney camp?

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.600
Again, it's like...

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.600
You know, you just took it in.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.600
You know, you just think...

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.600
Yeah.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.600
You know, no reason why.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.600
Yeah.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.600
We don't know why Honiton was shut down or...

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.600
Yeah.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.600
We didn't know what was happening.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.600
Yeah.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.600
Yeah.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.600
So as a child, you were in a camp.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.600
Yeah.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.600
You were in a camp.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.600
Yeah.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.600
You were in a camp.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.600
Yeah.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.600
You were in a camp.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.600
Yeah.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.080
So as a child, you had no idea.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.080
You just went along with wherever they took you.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.080
Yes, right.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.080
Yeah.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.080
So then...

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.080
Obviously, we were grateful they took us.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.080
Yeah.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.080
Yeah.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.080
So that...

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.080
What are your memories of Tonforay?

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.080
Cold, as usual.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.080
Yeah.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.080
It was cold.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.080
And...

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.960
Did you make friends?

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.960
Any friends there, I don't remember.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.960
No.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:50.960
Okay.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.960
I can't remember any of the friends there.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.960
Do you remember the school there?

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.960
No, again.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.960
It was just...

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:55.960
You went to school.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.960
You were just within the camps.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.320
Yeah.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.320
Yeah.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.320
That's all I remember.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.320
That's it.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.320
I have a photo of you at school, right?

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.320
So I'll pass that on to you.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.320
In the camp?

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.320
In the camp, yeah.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.320
Oh.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.320
Was there a school?

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.320
Oh.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.320
You know, Maniyat, but nothing.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.320
Oh, it'd be wonderful.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.320
Yeah.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.320
That'd be wonderful.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.320
Okay.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.320
Yeah.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:24.800
And after that, why did you choose to be housed in Dharonda or you just took whatever

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.000
was offered?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.320
I could feel we just took whatever was offered.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.680
Okay.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.360
They did ask where we wanted to...

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.360
They did say...

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.720
It's only I remember because mum was telling me.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.720
Yeah.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.720
There was choices to go to Leicester, Birmingham, or...

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.720
Yeah.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.720
And mum just didn't want to go those places.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.720
Oh, right.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.720
Because she knew we'll be...

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.720
Okay.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.720
...in a propaganda.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.720
So they just wanted a little more freedom, right?

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.720
Freedom, yeah.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.720
Yeah.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.720
So she just chose...

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:57.720
And plus, someone must have mentioned to her, schools in the... in Mid Wales or South Wales

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.120
are much better than in Birmingham or Leicester.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.120
Oh, right.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.120
Okay.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.120
So it was for school reasons.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.120
Yeah.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.120
For schooling reasons only.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.120
Right.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.120
Okay.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.120
She didn't want us to be laid down, just doing penny jobs elsewhere.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.120
Yeah.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.120
She wanted you to be educated.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.120
Yeah, educated.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.120
Uh-huh.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.120
So money was not the issue.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.120
Yeah.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.120
Yeah.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.120
Yeah.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.120
Do you remember when you first came to Pennygrife?

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.120
We...

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.120
Sort of.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.120
Because remember the house.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.120
Yeah.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.120
Was it by coach they brought you or something?

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.120
Oh, yes.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.520
Yeah, by coach.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.520
Yes, by coach.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.520
And you were then just reminded...

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.520
Tell me what it was like to be dropped off there and...

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.520
I mean, it was...

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.520
It was good because you thought, wow, place for our own, of our own.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.520
Remember, we were squashed in.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.520
Yeah.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.520
In the camp.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.520
Yeah.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.520
In the camp.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.520
Yeah, we found an angel there.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.520
Yeah.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.520
Yeah.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.520
And...

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.520
Who?

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.520
Harding.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.520
Harding, Miss Harding.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.520
Miss Harding.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.920
Someone who lived in Pennygrife by the name of Miss Harding.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.920
Yeah.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.920
So she basically adopted you as a family.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.920
Yeah.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:05.920
Yeah, she...

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.920
What was...

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.920
Was she a teacher or what?

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.920
She was like a social worker, was she?

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:11.920
I don't know.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.920
I don't know how she...

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:13.920
But she managed to find out.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.920
Uh-huh.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:15.920
There's an Asian family coming.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:16.920
Uh-huh.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.920
And she really helped us out.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.920
She even, on our behalf, wrote to Margaret Tatta, Tatta, Tatta, Tatta, Tatta, Tatta,

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.320
Margaret Tatta.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.320
Margaret Tatta.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.320
At that time.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.320
Yeah.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.320
Because...

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.320
Yeah.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.320
Because Hitesh was here before the exodus.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.320
Yeah.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.320
Yeah.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.320
So he was not classed as...

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.320
Like, we were classed as British.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.320
Oh, yeah.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.320
But he wasn't?

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.320
I don't know how he was...

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.320
Oh, he was...

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.320
Oh, his education...

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.320
No, sorry.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.320
His education...

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.320
Yeah.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.320
Was to be paid.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.320
But we had left Uganda.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.320
Oh, right.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.320
Okay.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.320
Yeah.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.320
Because we left Uganda.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.320
So he was not entitled to free education.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.320
To free education.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.720
But Miss Harding wrote to them, the education secretary.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.720
Oh, did she?

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.720
Margaret Tatta.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.720
Yeah.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.720
I think that was it when Hitesh was going to university.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.720
Yeah.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.720
Because that's what they wanted him to pay as an overseas passer.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.720
That's it, yes.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.720
And she basically sorted that out.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.720
Yes, yes.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.720
That's it.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.720
That's it, yeah.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.720
Okay.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.720
Miss Harding.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.720
Miss Harding.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.720
Yeah.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.720
Gosh.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.720
Yeah, she even came to Ilford once.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.720
Oh, did she?

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.720
Yeah.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.720
Uh-huh.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.120
Yeah.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.120
She stayed with us.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.120
Gosh, how nice.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.120
Yeah.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.120
But after obviously going back and she passed away and...

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.120
Yeah.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.120
Yeah.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.120
She was a Miss Harding, right?

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.120
So she didn't have children or anything.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.120
No, no.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.120
I don't think she had anyone.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.120
No, she didn't have anyone.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.120
No.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.120
So, no, no.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.120
She had some kind of family.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.120
Yeah.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.120
We tried to get in touch with her.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.120
But there's a row she's passed away.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.120
Yeah.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.120
Yeah.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.120
You know, obviously.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.120
Yeah.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.120
So initially, she was a Miss Harding.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.120
Yeah.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.120
So initially, she was a Miss Harding.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.120
Yeah.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.120
You know, obviously.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.520
Initially, you thought, oh, the house is really nice.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.520
But, you know, what were the drawbacks?

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.520
Oh, severe damp conditions.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.520
Oh, it was really damp.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.520
It was freezing.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.520
Yeah.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.520
It was freezing.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.520
There was no heating?

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.520
Just that one room coal fire.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.520
Oh, you had an open coal fire.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.520
Open coal fire in just one room.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.520
Wow.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.520
And that was the only warm place in that whole house.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.520
Yeah, the only warm place.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.520
Yeah.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:20.920
So, you had to buy this fuel there?

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:21.920
Yeah.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.920
So, yeah, they actually used to provide that.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.920
Oh, right.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.920
Like, color gas.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.920
Yeah.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.920
Color gas.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.920
But I think it was more...

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.920
It was liquid, was it?

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:31.920
It was liquid.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.920
Yeah.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.920
So, yeah.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:34.920
So, yeah.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:35.920
So, yeah.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:36.920
So, yeah.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:37.920
So, yeah.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:38.920
So, yeah.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:39.920
So, yeah.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.920
So, yeah.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:41.920
So, yeah.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:42.920
So, yeah.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:43.920
So, yeah.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.920
So, yeah.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.320
It was liquid, wasn't it?

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.320
That bit I can't remember.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.320
I don't know.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.320
But the oil heaters or whatever.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.320
Something like that.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.320
And you were all very young then.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.320
We were kids.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.320
Yeah.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.320
So, you went to primary school.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.320
You were in primary school to start with?

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.320
Yeah.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.320
Initially, I went to comprehensive school.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.320
Oh, you were put in comprehensive straight away.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.320
Initially.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.320
Yeah.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.320
And then, obviously, they gave me...

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.320
On the first day, they gave me some kind of test.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.320
Yeah.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.320
And obviously, I passed the test, like maths test, easily.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.320
Yeah.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.320
And then, one of the teachers said,

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.320
I'm going to go to the math test.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.320
I'm going to go to the math test.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.320
I'm going to go to the math test.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.720
And obviously, I passed the test, like maths test, easily.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.720
Yeah.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.720
Yeah.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.720
And the one of the teachers said,

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.720
I shouldn't be here.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.720
Yeah.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.720
Because, I became...

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.720
I was one of the top one.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.720
Yeah.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.720
They said, oh you should go to grammar school.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.720
Yeah.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.720
Yeah.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.720
And they straight away changed me to a grammar school.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.720
Okay.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.720
So, that's why I went to post grammar school.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.720
Oh, that's why you went to post grammar.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.720
Yeah.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.720
And you went...

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.720
So...

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.720
Oh, right, okay.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.720
So, I went to post grammar there.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.720
Yeah.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.720
And...

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.720
Yeah.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.720
So...

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.720
So, I went to post grammar there.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.720
Yeah.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.720
And...

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.720
Yeah.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:44.440
Obviously, initially, the accent was different.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.040
Yeah, English was.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.120
Our accent would have been different as well.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.240
So how did you find the school?

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.240
The school was okay.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.240
They could see.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.240
The teachers were really very accommodating.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.800
They knew we'd come from abroad.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.120
They knew we were refugees.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.920
They knew our background that way.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:16.480
Plus, I knew I was doing well in school compared to their own students.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.000
So they were quite surprised that way.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
I remember that.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Oh really, I see.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Yeah.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Yeah.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:33.480
And I still remember one of the friends and lunchtime, you know, mom used to give me food

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.960
and I used to share it with them.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.960
Oh, did you?

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:36.960
Did they like it?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Yeah.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.520
I remember a particular guy, he still remembers me.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.760
I remember phoning him the other day.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.800
He said, I remember you.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.800
Oh really?

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:53.240
Because he met my youngest brother, my brother Surin, somewhere in a pub.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.880
And just talking about Wales.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:00.080
And he said, oh, I used to have an Indian friend called Anil Papari.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.080
Oh my god.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.080
Under the blue.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.080
Oh my god.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:08.280
And Surin didn't say anything for a minute.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.720
And then after a while, because that's my brother.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.360
Good to god.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.360
What a coincidence.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.360
Exactly.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.360
And then I phoned him.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.360
He said, did you?

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.680
Okay, I remember you know why?

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:22.680
You were so kind.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.680
I said, why?

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.680
Okay, I used to share your food with me.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.680
How sweet.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.280
How sweet.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.080
And I used to help him in his maths homework.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.080
Oh, right, okay.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.080
Because people used to bully him.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.080
Oh, did they?

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.080
At school.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:44.880
And I used to share my food with him and help him with his homework.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:55.560
So that impression, I haven't seen him since 1978 when I left for university.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.080
But he still remembers me that way.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.480
So school wise.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.480
After my story.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.480
Yeah, the school was good.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.480
The school was good.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.480
For me, good.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.480
And it became more comprehensive.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.480
Later.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.480
I think after I must have gone.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.480
After I did.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:19.480
And while I was there, the students actually chose me to become the head boy there.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.480
Oh, why you say head boy?

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.480
So I became the head boy when I was in sixth form.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.480
Oh wow.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:25.880
Yeah.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.880
So I still remember the teachers making me a role model for them.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.880
Look, you should be like him.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.880
Really, like Anil Babari?

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.880
Yeah.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.880
Gosh.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.880
And then you left in 78 to go to university?

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.880
To go to university.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:40.880
And what did you study?

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:41.880
Computing.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:42.880
Oh wow.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.880
So I went to Norwich.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:44.880
Yeah.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.880
And parents were still in Benwick, right?

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.880
When you went to Norwich, right?

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.880
That's right.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:49.880
Okay.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:50.880
And?

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:55.280
And that's when, I think after a year later they came to London.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.280
Yeah, a year later they came to London, didn't they?

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.280
Yeah.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.280
Okay.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:06.780
So tell me a little bit how mum's contribution towards, mum and dad's contribution towards

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:10.280
setting up a business from nothing.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:14.280
Oh, you see, it gives you inspiration, isn't it?

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.280
But how their hard work.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.280
Very hard work.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.280
Builds into you.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.680
Yeah.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.680
So they set it up from nothing.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.680
From nothing.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.680
Yeah.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.680
Literally nothing.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.680
From nothing.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:27.680
Literally from nothing.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.680
Because we didn't have anything to start off with.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.680
No.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.680
Yeah.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:36.680
So the good thing is that we have unity in our family.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.680
Yeah.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.680
Yeah.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.680
So the whole idea is to help each other.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.680
Yeah.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.680
You know, it's not like mine and yours.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.680
It's ours.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.680
Yeah.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.680
It's always been ours.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.680
Yeah.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:48.680
Yeah.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.080
So that's what they've taught us.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.080
Families come first.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.080
And you've seen them work hard.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.080
We've seen them work hard.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.080
Yeah.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.080
Both mum and dad.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.080
Yeah.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.080
Yeah.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.080
When did mum stop working in the cooking?

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.080
Well, she...

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.080
In commercial cooking.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:08.080
I think after she had a stroke.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.080
Okay.

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:15.080
But we still, we still then just to keep her active, we wanted her to come in.

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.080
Yeah.

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.080
You have a shop, yeah?

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.080
You have a shop.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.480
We just...

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.480
I mean, I formally retired last year, first of November last year.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.480
Okay.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.480
Yeah.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.480
Yeah.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.480
For the shop, we just now listed out.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.480
Yeah.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.480
Okay.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.480
From first of November last year, yeah.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.480
Yeah.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:40.480
But unfortunately, in 1998, I was diagnosed with epilepsy.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.480
Okay.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.480
Yeah.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.480
Out of the blue.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.480
Yeah.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.480
Yeah.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.480
So that changed your life really?

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.480
That changed my life.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:48.880
Yeah.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:53.880
So then luckily the shop helped me.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.880
Because you had your own professional career, didn't you?

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.880
I did.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.880
Yeah.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.880
So I was hoping...

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.880
You had to stop that with 1998 after the epileptic attacks?

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.880
Yeah.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.880
A little bit, yeah.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.880
Because in 2003, I had to leave my job.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.880
2003, you had to leave, right?

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.880
Yeah.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:11.880
Okay.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.880
Because obviously with epilepsy, they take your license away.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.880
All right.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.880
Okay.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.280
So you had to travel by tubes and trains.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.280
Yeah.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.280
And that's not an easy job to do.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.280
No.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:27.280
So one thing I don't like is too much noise and too many people around me.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:32.280
But luckily, like you say, we had family support.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.280
Yeah.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.280
And something to fall back on this business, yeah.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.280
Yeah.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.280
You have children?

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.280
Two daughters.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.280
Two daughters.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.280
Yeah.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:46.680
Although my daughters came slightly late, but they came straight after.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.680
One after each other.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.680
Yeah.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.680
Literally 10 months apart.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.680
Oh, 10 months apart.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.680
Oh, fantastic.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.680
Yeah.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.680
Two fantastic girls.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.680
Yeah.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.680
Yeah.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.680
Especially the older one.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.680
Yeah.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.680
The one's getting engaged tomorrow.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.680
The one is getting engaged.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.680
Tomorrow.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.680
The one is married already.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.680
No.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.680
No.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.680
The other one's younger than her.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.680
Oh, righty.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.680
She's younger.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.680
Yeah.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.680
My older one's married.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.680
Older one is married, yeah.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.680
I always say I got four daughters.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.680
Four daughters, yeah.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.080
Because the two are your brothers, yeah.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.080
Yes.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.080
And you really look at your brother as your family.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.080
Exactly.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.080
Because they always see them grow up together.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.080
Yeah.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.080
The all four are so close, yeah.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.080
Yeah.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.080
Yeah.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.080
Yeah.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.080
Yeah.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.080
Yeah.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.080
Yeah.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.080
Yeah.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.080
Yeah.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.080
Yeah.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.080
Yeah.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.080
Yeah.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.080
Yeah.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.080
Yeah.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.080
Yeah.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.080
Yeah.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.080
Yeah.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.080
Yeah.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.480
Really good.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.480
So...

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.480
Yeah.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.480
And she...

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.480
Because now she's become a pharmacist.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.480
But I always wanted to push her away.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.480
Right, right.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.480
You can look.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.480
You be on your own.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.480
Yeah.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.480
And she looks after me.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.480
She does, doesn't she?

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.480
Since she was young.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.480
Really?

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.480
When I have...

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.480
Yeah, you have a fet.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.480
Fets, I normally cut my tongue.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.480
Oh, yeah.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.480
Bite into my tongue.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.480
Yeah.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.480
And I bleed a lot.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.480
Yeah.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.480
And she used to clean me at that young age.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.480
Oh.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.480
Yeah.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.480
Amika.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.480
Amika.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.480
So...

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.880
She's like...

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.880
Like a little mother.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.880
Yeah, she is.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:14.880
Yeah.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.880
I always call her that.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.880
Little mother.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:17.880
I always call her my ma, yeah?

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:18.880
Yeah.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:19.880
Yeah.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.880
Yeah.
