00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.040
My name is Richard Howell Shaw. I am a person, not a native of Newport but I've frequented

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:26.720
it on many occasions. I will be telling you my experience of watching the cult on the

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:34.800
Love Electric tour sometime in the late 80s. I can't quite exactly work out when it was.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.640
Newport Centre. I think it was my first gig. I'm not sure. My first proper gig. It was,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.120
so I went to see Public Enemy and I've got a timeline thing going on so I can't quite

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.920
work out whether it was Public Enemy or the cult. Quite a difference between the two.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:02.680
What was memorable about it was I was very young. I was still in school so I must have been,

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:14.320
I was less than 16, so maybe 15 or 14 years old and I was making my own attempts at trying to be

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:21.600
a young man I guess and it was an interesting, kind of scary experience because I was in a

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:30.520
large town and I'm used to small villages because I was surrounded by people who were drunk and I

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.800
wasn't. That's probably another reason why it's my most memorable gig because I wasn't heavily

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:49.960
intoxicated. I was wearing a pair of tight black jeans, winkle pickers and a ski jacket.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:02:00.160
I hadn't quite formed my luck by that time or maybe my budget hadn't extended to a black jacket

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.160
and I certainly didn't know what the opportunity was. I was wondering if I could, if I may be a

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:17.000
goth. The most memorable bit of the gig I think was the spitting. The audience was spitting at

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
the band and I remember Ian Asbury, the singer of the cult, said Anymore Flamon was stopping

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.560
the gig and I believe that Billy Duffy shouted yeah. They carried on so my assumption is there

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.480
was less spitting but that doesn't really go with the punk ethos of the early cult maybe,

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.520
I don't know. Was there a punk ethos with the cult? I mean I wasn't spitting, it wasn't my fault.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:49.560
I don't know what Ian Asbury's mum looks like but I can hazard a guess. I think he was wearing a

00:02:49.720 --> 00:03:02.560
large fur hat and a leather jacket but I'm just, no, I'm just, that's a composite of imagery from

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:12.240
that time. He was probably wearing a lot of phlegm as well. Yeah I would say there were a number of

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:24.760
goth types, there were some punk types. I mean I think back in those days people tended to kind

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.880
of, there was an element of tribalism but people would also come together for certain acts so

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.240
definitely felt like there was a culture thing going on. There weren't too many people like me

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.680
but then I was very young to be going there and I think Eve and I was aware of that at the time,

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:49.440
that's why I was slightly scared. Felt like a different world. I think there were about three

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.280
or four of us from school. I can't remember how we got here, I can't remember how we got back,

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.760
but we did. I can't remember how I negotiated that with my parents either but it's my first

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.880
proper gig. I think, I'm not clear, it could have been public anyway. I would say it would be cold

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:15.200
because yes once again I was wearing a ski jacket. I felt pretty cool in school. I felt slightly

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:22.320
more unruly. I felt that I was slightly better maybe than other people or I had a little bit

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.880
of a secret. I was feeling quite young. I probably felt connected, happy and joyful.
