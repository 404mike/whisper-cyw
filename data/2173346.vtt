00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
My name is Chandrika Joshi and it is the 29th of February 2024 at 4 o'clock.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'm interviewing Alnashir Pabani at his home in Astrad, Pentra in the Rwanda.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Hi there, I'm Alnashir Pabani and it's a pleasure to do this interview.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So there you go, what would you like me to tell you?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Tell me about your memories of Uganda, your family in Uganda.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Well, the earliest memories I got are, I can still remember when I was in primary school.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I used to walk to school and as you know the weather out there was so hot.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So you'd have sessions of school where the hot periods, they'd close the school.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And then you'd go back in the late afternoon to finish off the hours.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Yeah, basically it was a good time, hard times.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Dad was always in work, Mum was always cooking and you know we were always in school.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I used to play a lot of sports as I was growing up.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Used to play a lot of football, cricket, you know, all things like that.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000
But then with growing up, you know, you learn different things and I wasn't very good in school.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And after a few years, then as 1972, all the problems started in Uganda.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And all the British passport holders and all the Asians were expelled from Uganda.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Tell me where you were in Uganda, which town?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Well, I was born in a small place called Saroti.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I stayed with my grandparents and I studied in Saroti Primary School.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And then we moved to Mbali.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And I was in Mbali then and then the late, late, well early 70s then we moved to Kampala.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
In my grandfather's house because of all the problems.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
But yeah, up until then Mbali was my home and yes, I loved it. Brilliant.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So did your parents migrate or was it your grandparents who migrated?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Well, it was my grandparents who came to Uganda, well East Africa really.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Because at that time the British were building the railways.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So my grandparents, they came and I don't know much about my grandmother,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
because I think she stayed behind for a while.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
But my grandfather arrived basically to work on the railways.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And he used to travel back and forth, back and forth to the railways.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And he realized it wasn't for him. He just didn't want to work on the railways.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So what he did, he decided to put all his money, hired a load of Africans to carry all the groceries.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So he used to buy all the stuff, travel all the way to the railways.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
It didn't matter which area, whether it was Uganda, Kenya or Tanzania.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
He'd travel through the jungles all the way with carrying all this.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And he'd sell all the products to the railway workers.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And then after a few years, once everybody got to know him,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and he decided that he was going to open a shop.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So when he was traveling around, he had found this patch in the middle of nowhere in Uganda.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And he called it Paranga.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And he opened a little shop, basically a shed with a room in the back where he was sleeping.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And he told all the railway workers, you can come to me now and buy whatever you want.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And basically they used to there buy any.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And if they needed something, he'd make a note of it so he'd get it for them.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And that's how he opened his first shop.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
It was Ahmad Haji, his name, Ahmad Haji Pabani.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And yeah, he then basically brought my grandmother over.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And it just built up from that.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And my memory of that town in Paranga is roughly down to about 11, 12 houses and a schoolhouse.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And that's where Mum and Dad and we used to live.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I remember the schoolhouse.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And you know, one of the memories of the schoolhouse is when we had the rainy season,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
the orchard, it was full of oranges and grapefruits,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and you'd have the heavy rains.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And when you go out there, you had a blanket of fruit on the ground

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
because the rain was so heavy.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Because the rain was so heavy, you know.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
It was fabulous.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I always remember that.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
That is one memory that's stuck in my head.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Really good, you know.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So yeah, there was a schoolhouse there.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And what he did, my grandfather, he built another shop.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And then he'd send to India to get his friends over.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And bit by bit, all his friends come over.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
So there was a grocery shop, then you had a bicycle shop,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
you had a car shop, you know, a mechanic and things like that.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So he was an entrepreneur?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
So yeah, he was. He was.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And yeah, he did quite well there.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
He built the whole community.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
That's right.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
It wasn't a very big community, but he built it.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And then he moved to Soroti then.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So this town, your grandfather started out in, whereabouts was it, in Uganda?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Oh, do you know what you're asking?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
All I know, it was called Paranga.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000
You know, and it wasn't far from the border of Kenya, actually, you know, Kisumo?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Oh yeah, Kisumo.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Yes, yeah.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
He said the borderline.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
That's right.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Around there it was. It wasn't very far.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And I think the reason he opened it there was it was closer to the border

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
for the guys to come from the railways in Kenya, you know.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So yeah.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And your grandfather would have gone from India to sort of Mombasa with the railways?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
That's right, yeah.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
So anything he talked about, how he travelled?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Well, all I know is he came over on a ship he did, but didn't know much about it.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And a lot of this information I found out was through my uncle.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Because my uncle was in Britain studying when everything kicked off.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
So he told me quite a lot and there were some photographs which he wouldn't give me.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Because the reason I was asking all these questions, in the mid-70s I started writing it all down.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Right? I started writing it all down.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So I was looking for information myself, you know.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:46.000
So all I know is he came from India and then he sort of travelled through the three countries where the railways were being built.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
I don't think there was much to do with Tanzania, but it was more Uganda and Kenya, you know.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Yeah. And I presume they came from Gujarat or Kutch was it?

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Kutch, yeah it was Kutch it was.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And Mundra?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Yes, that's right, Kutch, Mundra.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And that's where my mother is from as well.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And basically my great-grandfather was still out in India, Kutch.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And when my dad was born and as he grew up and all that, my dad was driving lorries for my granddad.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And at that time my granddad had built up quite a business with cotton, soap, oil, all that, you know.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
So dad was driving for him, driving the lorries and that.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And then he sent dad to India because that's what people used to do.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:53.000
They send your kids or go see where, you know, because dad was born in Uganda, but he'd never been to India.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:03.000
So dad went out there and he found the place fascinated, like, you know, and dad was so easy going everybody loved him.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And while he was there, now this is the story my mum told me.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:20.000
My mum and her friends used to go to school and things like that and they'd go to the mosque in the evenings and they'd see my dad and his friends and that.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And she used to say, oh look at them, like, you know, they can't, you know, behave themselves and all that.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:40.000
What she didn't realise that when she got home one day after quite a few months, dad's grandfather had arranged to marriage, arranged the marriage between mum and dad.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And he told dad, he said, you know, going back to Uganda without a bride.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And that bride happened to be mum.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
My daughter needs to look at you and sort.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
No.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Yeah, so it was quite nice.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:04.000
But I found out that they sort of arrived in Uganda and it was only a couple of months after I was born.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Yeah.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
So I was born in 57 November 57.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.000
So I'm assuming my parents got back from India in August, October, November around there.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
You know, so yeah.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And you were born in Uganda.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
I was born in Uganda in Saroti.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Yeah.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
30th of November, 1957.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Yeah.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
So it was good.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Yeah.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
We stayed.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
What was your childhood like in Saroti?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Well, I can remember my school days where I lived with my uncles and aunties and that with my grandparents.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And it was quite hard.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
It was quite hard.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:54.000
You know, it was hard work and being sort of kids and you've got it wrong, your aunties would give you a slap.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
But, you know, so yeah, we did all right.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Did all right.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.000
But I wouldn't say it was how can I put it?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Sometimes it wasn't very pleasant, but it's OK.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
OK.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
OK.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
We we learned and basically me and Yashmin, my sister, we stayed there.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And then I can't exactly remember how old I was when we went to Mbali then with mum and dad.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
I can't quite remember that.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
But then in Mbali, I remember my school days.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
I remember my senior days in the senior school.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And I used to have fun, lots of sports.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:49.000
I always remember that we on top of the street where we were, it was a school field and we'd play football there and cycling and that.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And we always sit down on a weekend listening to Arsenal playing because Arsenal was our favourite team.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Used to love listening to the radio.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And yeah, it's good.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And as I said, I used to play a lot of sports.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I used to do athletics.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
I used to play cricket, hockey, football and squash was one of my love.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I loved playing squash.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000
In fact, I carried on with squash and cycling when I came to Britain.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
I enjoyed that.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:33.000
So when Amin gave the notice that three months time you've got to leave, what was that like for your family, your parents?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Oh, it was chaos.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:42.000
It was, you know, we were all trying to and you had I think it was close to 800000 people trying to leave the country.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And you can imagine what chaos that caused.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And we landed.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Well, mum and they were still in Mbali, but I went to Kampala to help dad because we had to get our visas and things like that.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And I remember the square.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:05.000
You had all the main embassies, you had the Canadian, the British, the Americans, the Red Cross.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
They were all there.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And I remember four four queues outside the British Embassy, four across, and it was going round the block.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Right. So you had so many people trying to.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Now, my memory of that was I used to sleep the night there on the pavement to keep my place and dad would come there in the morning and take over.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:37.000
So I would go home, have a couple of hours sleep, something to eat, and I go back down in the afternoon for dad to come home and have some food.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
So this is how we kept the place to get not to lose the queue.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:50.000
And some of the things were happening in the queues were just, oh, and you get to know people when you're there day in, day out.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And I seen this young boy.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
He happened to see his father in the queue for the wrap.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And he ran to see his father and the guys from the army caught him.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
They were and he said, that's my dad, my dad.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
I just want to be with my dad.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
And they wouldn't listen to him.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
They thought he was jumping the queue and all that.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Oh, that was that was a horrible sight to see.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000
They tied him to the bars of the Jeep and they took the canopy off.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:29.000
And he was tied there and they were whipping him going up and down the street to show people that you can't get away with it.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
You know, so that was horrible.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
I was to see a young kid.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
He was no, no bigger, no older than me.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
You know, and I was only what, 14, you know, and to see that.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:51.000
But that was only one of the things some of the army guys, they used to just whip people walking along and they they had the big long whips like that.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
And they just hit you for no reason at all.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Like, you know, because I mean, that basically corrupted their mind to say we were robbing the country and all that, you know, because initially he started picking on the Jews.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Right.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
The things he came out and said about the Jews.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
I always remember that.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And then he started saying about the British and the Asians.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
And, you know, that's what killed the country.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Because once everybody left, the country just collapsed.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
You know, the economy just collapsed.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
But I always remember that I was there sleeping in the night.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Well, I was there in the afternoons for dad to come home.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Then he'd come back for an hour or so.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And then I'd go back in the night and I'd sleep on the pavement, keeping the place.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And we had to do it.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
And I was the oldest son.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
So I had to do it.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
And then dad would help his brothers and sisters and help granddad and grandma.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:59.000
And it got a little bit hectic then because one of the memories I remember is my dad's younger brother.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
He forgot the key to his shop.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And he thought, well, it's his shop.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
And he broke the door open.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Well, the army arrested him.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:22.000
And he landed up in a camp where once you go in there, you never seen they were whipping and killing people like a concentration camp.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Always remember that because a lot of photographs came out later on where people were tied to the posts.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.000
But lucky enough, dad was a man of many talents, I would say.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:45.000
And he got to know one of the guards and he sort of made a deal.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
What exactly he paid them, what he did, I don't know.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:57.000
But he managed to get my uncle out of there and straight on a plane with granddad and grandma with the Red Cross.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
And they managed to get away to America.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
So that was a good thing that he saved his brother.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000
But yeah, there was some horrible sights when I was in Mbali before I went to Kampala.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Our neighbor, one of the neighbors, they took her, you know.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
And there was so much raping and pillaging and that going on.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
And one of the things I remember as well is everybody was selling their stuff.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
So mum was selling everything off.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000
And now this is a good bit, this is, which was really shocking.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Mum was selling all the stuff and there was a boat with a light in it, electric light.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:53.000
And the army jeep stopped outside the house and they came up and Shabila, who was there with mum, started screaming, crying and screaming.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
And this guy said, the army guy said, whoa, whoa, whoa, don't start screaming.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
We're not here to hurt you. We just want to see where you go for sale.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
And they were looking at the boat.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
And mum said, oh yeah, yeah, you can have it. No, no, we will pay for it.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
And I can promise you, nobody will touch you.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
None of my men will touch you. I guarantee you.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.000
And I always remember mum saying that and he actually bought the boat and he paid for it.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Yeah, yeah, he actually paid for it.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
But my worst memory.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Now, how can I put this? I'd say it as it is.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:40.000
I was on my way into town and I was going to go from Jamath Khanna first.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
As you know, Jamath Khanna is a mosque, our mosque.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:52.000
And I always remember I'm coming past the Hindu temple and just past the Hindu temple, there's a big green.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:00.000
And I'm walking along the green and all of a sudden a car pulls up and a jeep behind the car, an army jeep.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:09.000
And they're all screaming in Swahili, right, telling this man and his son to get out of the car.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
And the boy got out, but the old man couldn't get out in time.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:23.000
And I'm basically, there's the pavement, the road, there's the pavement and I'm by, that's how close.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
I'd say about two metres.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:36.000
And they just walk up, beat the boy with the stick and the other one come round and he just took his gun out and shot the old man through the window.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:47.000
And that, I just froze and I was standing there and I literally peed myself.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:55.000
I wet myself and I was shaking like hell and I thought I'm next because I've seen this happening.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
But because they seen that I was a young boy, I was shaking, I was scared.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
There's no way I was a threat.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
And they just jumped in the car and drove off.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Asians, yeah, but I can't, I didn't know them, I can't remember them.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:26.000
All I can remember is that thing, he come out, he beat the boy, one of them beat the boy and the other one shot the old man because he couldn't get out of the car quick enough.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
And that was the worst thing.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
I thought that was the end of me that day.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
I really thought that was the end of me.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
But they could see I was no threat to them.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:46.000
I was shaking, I wet myself, I ran back home and mum found me under the bed.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
And that's the second time mum found me under the bed.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000
And the second time was in Kampala.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
That was the first time mum found me.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
So the first time was in Mabale.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
In Mabale, yeah.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Second time was Kampala.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Now what had happened, I'm a big Western fan, right?

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000
I love Westerns.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
So they were showing the good, the bad and the ugly.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Now in Uganda, they used to have shows from the West.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
They used to have shows from afternoon shows.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Then you had three to six, then three to nine, nine to twelve.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000
So I went to see the good, the bad and the ugly, nine to twelve.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.000
So as kids, nothing was, you know, so we didn't really...

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000
So we were walking through now and I seen, we were coming through the mosque in Kampala.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
I seen all the lights on it.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
It was late for lights, you know, and all these army jeeps.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:02.000
So I jumped on, curious, jumped on a bin to have a look through the window.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:10.000
And all I could see was lots and lots of army men with guns and people on the floor.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Spread out eagles.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
They were trying to rob the place.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Take anything they could get and money, you know, because they knew money there.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
And I thought, wow, what's happening?

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
And I tried to jump off.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
And as I jumped, the bin fell over.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
And I run.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
And I mean I run.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
All I could hear was machine gun fire behind me.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Screaming and shouting, all that and all that.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
All I did was I just dived into this ditch, right?

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.000
I went under into the ditch all the way, crawled right out to the other side of the road.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Right, because this was a long ditch all the way through the tunnel, all the way out to the other side.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
I was absolutely soaking, dirt, everything.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
And I just run.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000
I just run.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
I remember jumping over a fence, like a hedge.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
And that was it.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
And that was the second time mum found me under the bed.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
I was that scared.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
That's the only twice I can think I was in danger.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Did they traumatise you?

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
I don't know what.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
I think I was pretty strong.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000
It didn't really, right?

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
I just basically forgot about it.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
You know, it was basically my mind blocking it, I suppose.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
I don't know.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
I'm not a psychiatrist or anything, but I suppose that's what it...

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
And kids tend to be resilient.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
And I just...

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
And the third time was quite...

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
I thought, oh, am I going to make it?

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Mum gave me a ring to put on because all the kids were very...

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
to see if we could get something out, like, you know?

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:03.000
And we got to the airport, Intay Bay Airport, and they were checking everybody.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Nobody was getting out of there.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
They were taking all the necklaces off and the rings off.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
And they put me in this room and they stripped me.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Basically, I was standing there with my pants.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
That's it, right?

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
And they were like little shorts, homemade things like mum had made.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.000
And they took the ring off my hands, right?

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
And they just stripped me clean.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
And then all of a sudden, lucky enough, I was out of the room.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
And they just stripped me clean.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
And then all of a sudden, lucky enough, the phone rang.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
So the woman went to answer the phone, and she was barking away on the phone,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
shouting at somebody.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
And I just grabbed all my clothes, checked them on quick,

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
and walked out straight onto the plane.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Right?

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
And it was a British Caledonian plane, right?

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
So they couldn't board that.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
They couldn't have the British territory.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
And I was lucky I got on there.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
And when I got on there, I noticed mum and the sisters and brothers and that.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
And we were lucky we got out there, right?

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Now, what exactly happened with the rest of them, I don't know.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
But that day, I thought, now was it like, you know,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
especially when they made me strip, I thought, oh no.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Because they were checking that we weren't hiding anything under our clothes and that.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
And yeah, I was lucky.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
I just grabbed all my clothes.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
She was barking on the phone.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
And I just slowly opened the door and walked out.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
That's brilliant.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Yeah.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
I just walked out, run up the runway straight onto the plane.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Because they didn't have buses and things like that.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
There were people who just walk into the planes.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
And that's what happened.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
And once we were on the plane, brilliant.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
And I remember that flight, right?

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000
I remember that flight because we stopped in Benghazi.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
We stopped in Benghazi.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
They fueled up.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
We weren't allowed to get off the plane, but they fueled up.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
And then we flew to Britain.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
And we landed at Stensted Airport.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
And it was November.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
And as I was on top of the steps coming out,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
all you could see was frost everywhere.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
It was freezing.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
So when we got down, they were going through all the customs

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
and everything and that.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
I'm waiting, waiting, waiting.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
They'd lost all my luggage.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
They'd lost all my suitcases.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
I had three suitcases.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
They'd lost them all.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
All I had was literally what I was wearing.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Did they find them?

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000
No.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000
No.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
But I'll come to that after.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.000
They found when we came, we boarded the buses.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
We didn't know where we were going.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
So they drove from Stensted Airport to Gaydon.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
And they called it Gaydon Resettlement Center.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Basically, it was a refugee camp, you know?

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
But it wasn't bad.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
It was lovely.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
When we got there, they gave me clothes

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
because they could see I was cold.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
They gave me clothes.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
I put my clothes on, warmed up, and they had opened the kitchens up

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
and we had food and everything.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
They fed us well, you know?

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Really good.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Brilliant.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000
You know, tidy.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
That was a nice welcome.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
How long were you there?

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
We got there in November and we left there in March,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
the following year, 73.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000
So I think it was March the 14th I arrived in Penrith.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
But Dad had arrived a week earlier with the kids

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
because Mum wasn't very well.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
So I stayed behind with her until she was well enough to travel.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
And yeah, that's another story to tell.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
It was just, how can I say?

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
My stomach was churning and yet I was excited, you know?

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000
But in the camp itself are some marvellous times

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
and some horrendous times as well.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:23.000
You get all the elderly people would find a little corner

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
and they'll play the cards, you know?

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000
And then you had us youngsters with our radios.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
I used to go play a lot of badminton and table tennis.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
So I was never hanging around.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
I was out playing.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.000
And there was a university professor from Leamington Spa

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
who used to pick us up in a minibus

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
and take us to play badminton and table tennis all over the place.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
But the one thing I used to have in the Midlands a lot was racial problems.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Racial, terrible names and they scream and shout

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
and tell you go where you came from and all that, you know?

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
And you had lots of...

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
But a 15-year-old kid then, you know,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
and some of the boys were a little bit older than me who were with me,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
they just wanted to fight everybody.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
And I didn't, like my old man, my father,

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
he would have just slapped one of them and that'd be it.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Now with me I was more like mum.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000
I didn't want to know, I didn't want to fight at all, so I just walk away.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
And don't get me wrong, if it came to the crunch I stood my ground.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
But I didn't want to get into situations like that,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
but there was a lot of racial problems.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
We had a few problems when we went playing badminton and table tennis and that.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Yeah.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:47.000
But in the camp we had a lot of youngsters thinking they ruled the roost.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
They gang this and they gang that and all that.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
And they were harassing all the old men and everything.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:04.000
And I always remember my cousin's father, Kareem Khasab and Firoz Khasab,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.000
their father and his friends, they loved playing cards.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
And they used to sit in the corner playing

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
and for weeks on end nobody would disturb them.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
But this gang tried to take over to say,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
we are ruling the camp and we are the bosses here and all that.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
They walked in there with a big jack-o-blaster

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
and they were blasting the music and all that.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
So they kept harassing the old men.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
And then one day Kareem's father said to my dad,

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
oh look, can you do something about this, like can you help us?

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
So dad walked in there and he told him, excuse me boys, can you take that out?

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
And he wouldn't listen until dad heavy handed.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
He just laid them out.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
He'd done a good job on them and he smashed their jack-o-blaster

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.000
and he told them, you ever come in here again, you'll have another one again.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:11.000
So this particular boy, he knew a Sikh guy in another camp.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
And they were the big guys, like you know, he said,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
I'm going to bring him over here and I will sort this guy out.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
That's my dad, like you know.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
So there's word going around the camp, oh this is going to happen and all that.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
You know how it is? Everybody's on alert.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:37.000
And oh that was, oh my God, Chandrika, that was absolutely amazing what happened.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
And he had this big fence post with sharp end

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000
and he was going to stab dad with it, like you know, with standing behind this guy.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:53.000
So this one evening now, bus comes along, a car comes along

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.000
and there's loads of men and this guy comes out of the car, Sikh guy.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:07.000
So that guy with the fence post, he runs over, he tells them, come on in, he said, let's go in there.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.000
So we're all in the reception now. I'm worried about talking to my dad.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
And all the boys were there and cousins were there, we're all there now.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:26.000
And this guy walks in and he flings the doors open to make his entrance like.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000
So dad is just sitting there, you know, he's so calm and cool.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000
He didn't care, dad never cared.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Because dad could handle himself, you know, he wasn't, you wouldn't, you wouldn't just pick on Bahadur, you know.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Bahadur Ahmad Haji Pabani, you definitely wouldn't.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.000
And if you did pick on him, you'd have someone to pick on and somebody leave you his mark.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
So anyway, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:01.000
So dad got up now because he could hear the noise and the commotion.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:09.000
And the fellow walks in, dad opens the door where the guys are playing and he comes out, he shuts the door behind him.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
And they look at each other, right.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:20.000
So they walk up to each other now and this guy now with the post thinks like we got him now, you know, can see Bahadur now.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
He's panicking. And he walked up to each other and they grabbed each other and gave each other a big hug.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
And I said, hi, how are you doing? All that, you know.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000
So he said to my dad, he said, what's happening?

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000
He said, who is this guy I'm supposed to meet up and it's me.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
He said, you are? Yeah, it's me.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000
I gave him a slap so he brought you in to sort me out.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Leave it with me, he said, he turned around, grabbed that boy by the throat.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
He said, let me tell you something now.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
You lay a finger on him, I'm going to shove that bar up your arse.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
I tell you, I couldn't believe it.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000
And dad, you know, dad knew him from the belly.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Like, you know, brilliant.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
It was great. It was really nice.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
And we never had any problems after that.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Never. But dad was number one there.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
He really just kept everything cool.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
He didn't get into any hassle, enjoyed himself.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000
But dad was working, see, because within two days of us arriving in the camp,

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
dad went looking for work.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
And because we already had British passports,

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
we managed to get our national insurance number.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Our dad had his national insurance number straight away.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
So he went to Coventry, looked for work and he had a job in the Fords.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Wow, OK.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
And he worked in Ford, so he'd work away for the week

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
and come home on the weekends.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
In the camp. In the camp, yeah.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000
And we did that till March.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:06.000
And they said to dad that there's a place in South Wales and it's nice.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Well, Firoz and Carine Babani, Kassam and them,

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
they were originally from the camp here in Wales.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
In Tonfenay.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
And they said, oh, come over here, it's lovely and all that.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
So this is why we came here.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Dad came over first, because as I said, mum wasn't well and I stayed behind.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000
Dad came on his own first to have a look around,

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
seen the house in Penrith they offered, liked it.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000
So because he liked it, he went straight into Cardiff to look for work.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Right. And he went to Cardiff and he found work straight away

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
in a company called Edward Currens in Cardiff.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000
And they told him, yeah, fine, because dad was mechanic by trade.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
So he was a tool handler.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000
And then he learned to drive trains because he was driving trains as well.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000
And he had a job straight away.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
So he came back, arranged it all great.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
He was going to take all the kids first.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
And I was to stay there with mum and come the following week.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
So I said, yeah, great.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000
So like I said, I'm not quite sure, but I'm pretty sure.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:30.000
99.9% sure it was the 14th of March, 1973, we arrived in Penrith.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:37.000
And we drove the bus through the valleys and going to Penrith.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000
Now, I'm all excited because it's a new adventure for a 15 year old kid.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000
But there again, I'm a little bit apprehensive as well.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:52.000
And when we get to Penrith, I started, oh, my God, my stomach was churning.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
There was a gang of skinheads.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000
And I'm thinking, oh, no, no, please, no.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000
And I was really panicking now.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000
So there's a gang of skinheads, loads of neighbours and everybody.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
Dad had come out with the kids as well.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
You know, they're all there and all excited.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.000
So we got off the bus and oh, my God, what a welcome.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000
What a welcome.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Absolutely amazing welcome from all the neighbours and that.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000
And the gang of skinheads, they were brilliant.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:36.000
And the leader of the gang, whose name is Keith Harris, who I still keep in touch with,

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:44.000
after getting to know everybody, I started dating his sister.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000
I started dating his sister, Kim.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
And I keep in touch with her as well.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000
And you can imagine, like, my stomach just, that relief, like, you know,

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
to think that the boys, the skinheads who were giving me trouble in the midlands,

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000
and they're completely different over here, like, you know, brilliant, brilliant.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Loved it.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
What was it like in Penrith, early days?

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
Well, early days, we started school and it was nice.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
I was going to Ferndale Comprehensive School.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
They called it Ferndale, but it's actually situated in Mardie.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:26.000
So, yes, I was going there and I just couldn't settle in school.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
Just couldn't settle.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:36.000
And I went to school from March to the following April.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:44.000
But before that, what I used to do, I used to bunk school and work in Tilerstone Co-op.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Did you?

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000
In the warehouse.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Yeah.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
And only part-time, like, you know.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:58.000
And it started off right opposite the shop in Tilerstone was a little corner shop,

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
which later on became a chemist.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000
But before it became a chemist, it used to be a second-hand shop.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
And I always remember a record player in there.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000
And I loved it, I did, because when we left the camp,

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
where we used to do discos in the camp, I used to help the guy.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000
He gave me a box full of singles.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000
Wow.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
So I had all these singles, right, but no record player.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
So I asked Mum, could she give me money to buy that?

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
And she said, look, we can't afford it.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
You'll have to work and save up yourself.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.000
So that's what I did.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000
I was bunking school, working in Tilerstone Co-op.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
And as soon as I had enough money, which I always remember was five pounds,

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
I went and bought, because he used to give me a couple of pennies here and there

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000
for doing the work.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
So that record player was five pounds.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
Five pounds. And I bought that in that shop.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Wow.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
And yeah, it was brilliant.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
And I think with Mum and Dad, they taught us the work ethic.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
That, look, we are in a country, it's new to us,

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000
we can't afford all these fancy things and that.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
So you want something, you're going to have to work for it.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
And you're going to have to save it yourself, right?

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
So Mum and Dad always say that.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Dad used to, because he was a mechanic,

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000
he used to repair people's cars to bring in extra money.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Now, by 591, there was a row of garages and Dad had four of them.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
He rented four of them.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000
And everybody used to come from all over the place.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
And word of mouth got around that there's a guy who repairs cars

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
and he'll do anything.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:46.000
And then it didn't matter whether it was raining, sunny, snowing, whatever.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
Come on, Al-Nashir, we're changing the gearbox today.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
And he gave me out of bed.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Oh, my God, I hate it.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000
I hate it.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
And we used to change the gearbox and engines.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000
And I learned quite a bit, learned quite a bit.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:11.000
And most of the work was either done in the evenings or weekends.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000
Because when I was 16 then, the guy in Tidastown Co-op said to me

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000
that when you're 16, I'll get you a job in the main warehouse.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:27.000
So I couldn't leave school in September because my birthday was in November.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Right?

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
So I had to work till April, right?

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:37.000
And April the 16th, 1974, these dates are still stuck in my head.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
I started working for the co-op full time in Tiaro.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Wow, okay.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:49.000
And I used to do 40 hours a week and I used to get paid seven pounds something.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
That's all, for 40 hours.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
That was in 74.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.000
And my cousin used to come down from London.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000
And one day he said to me, he said, why don't you come and work with me?

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000
He said, I'll get you some money, you know.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Yeah, so basically when my cousin said, look, you know, why don't you come in?

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000
I'll help you.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000
So every Friday he used to jump in the car, go with him.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
And I'd work night shift on Friday and night shift on Saturday.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000
And then come back on Sunday, ready for Monday in the co-op.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:30.000
And I did that for a while, but traveling all the way all the time was getting too much.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:37.000
But, you know, to make money and just earn something extra, I used to have quite a few jobs.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:43.000
I used to work 40 hours a week in the co-op.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:52.000
In Tonipandi, right next to the main square, the upper square, there used to be an old picture room.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000
And I used to be in Usher there.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000
Right. I used to work there every evening after the co-op.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Then Saturday morning, I used to work in Penry's Spa.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:09.000
Right. And the manageress, Linda, I still see her now.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Yeah. She still is gorgeous as she was then.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000
She is lovely.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:23.000
And then Saturday afternoon and Sunday, I used to work in Tonipandi Petrol Station.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:30.000
So I was constantly working, earning five a year, five a year there.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000
You know, because in them days wages weren't much.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Gosh, so you've got the same work ethics as your father.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
Well, yeah, you had to do it.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000
And I think I had the same thing with my father.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
I used to spend it as well.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000
So I used to give some to my mother and then by the weekend I'd say,

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000
Mom, can I borrow some money?

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000
So yes, it was all right. It was.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000
And then, what can I say?

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
Things in Penry's were lovely.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.000
I enjoyed my time up there, but it was quite expensive.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Renting a home up there, you know, very expensive.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Dad kept on working and when he had an accident in the factory where he worked

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000
and he lost his fingers, a couple of fingers and damaged his thumb.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
So when he used to repair cars, he couldn't quite do it all

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
because he couldn't grip the nuts and bolts and stuff like that.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:38.000
So Alan and Sheer had to step up, you know, and oh, God, it was...

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000
I think that put me off becoming a mechanic, you know.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
And yeah, well, we did it.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:51.000
And then with Dad having his compensation for losing his fingers and that,

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000
he bought a house in Pollypreet.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000
So which year was that?

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000
Well, you know what? I can't quite remember.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000
I was 23, 24, something like that.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:11.000
And then when Dad moved, I stayed behind because I was caught in Kathleen,

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:18.000
my ex-wife, and I decided to stay with her.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:25.000
So she moved in with me and we were renting Dad's house then.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:38.000
And I think it was the following year we decided to get married, you know, 82.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000
No, 81, sorry. 81, that's right.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:49.000
And yeah, we were great. We were together for 38 years.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Yeah.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.000
But marriages fall apart, so it happened.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:06.000
And then I bought this house down here in 82, I think it was August 82.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000
And I've been here ever since, you know, so yeah.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000
Your first home in your home.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
My first home, yeah, my own, yeah.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
Yeah, and still here.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
I'm still here, yes.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
I built it up by buying the house next door.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
And yeah, it's big.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.000
I'm on my own, but you know, this is more like a family hub now

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:34.000
because Frida comes here, my little sister,

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:40.000
then my son Azad and Philip and Michelle, daughter, they all come in here, you know.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000
And yeah, Carl comes in sometimes, my son.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000
And the grandchildren, which is Ruben, Amber,

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
and Michelle's kids come here, Bethany and Abby and all that.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000
So yeah, I've got somebody here all the time.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000
You know, in one week somebody will show up, so it's nice.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:07.000
And at one time I did think of selling up and moving to Spain.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
I was thinking of moving to Benidorm, but when Yashmin passed away.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Yashmin's your sister.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000
Yashmin's my sister, yeah.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000
She passed away.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:25.000
And yeah, everybody remembers us from the program I did with the BBC called Full House.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:32.000
And then we did the series, the follow-up series of Full House, which was on BBC One.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:38.000
And yeah, basically that's what I was supposed to do, a couple of other documentaries with Sky.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000
But that never progressed after.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000
They did the research and that.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000
It was all about Uganda nations coming to Wales.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000
And as it happened, then that didn't take off, but you're doing it now.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Yeah.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Tell me more about your sort of life now in Rwanda.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000
Well, I love the Rwanda.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:08.000
All my brothers and sisters, they traveled away, moved away.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:15.000
Like Kareem, my brother, he moved to Milton Keynes and he said he wouldn't come back to Wales.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000
He's done well for himself, you know.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000
He's accounted by trade.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:29.000
And he's in Milton Keynes now since he was about 18, 19.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000
I mean, he worked with me in Grenada.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Then he worked for the government in St. Athens.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000
Now he's working in the Royal Mint.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Right.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000
So he moved from mum's house in Ponty to his own flat.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.000
From his flat then he got married and now he's in Kilbernet.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000
Shabila went to Basin Stoke.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Shabila's your sister.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.000
Shabila's my sister.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000
She trained in Bridgend as a nurse.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000
And she went to Basin Stoke.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000
From Basin Stoke, she's in Leicester now.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000
And she got married to my cousin Kareem.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:19.000
And I mean, Farida, that's my little sister, she was working as a chef down in West Wales.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:27.000
And then she got married to a local West Wailian and she lives in West Wales.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000
Yashmin married a Welshman as well.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.000
And she stayed in Thrunapia.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Unfortunately, last year she passed away.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000
Sorry, no, 2022.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000
That's right, 2022 she passed away, not 2023.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000
And yeah, so it's just five of us left.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.000
And I stayed in the Rhondda because I love the Rhondda.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000
And I try and do as much as I can.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000
I got my little charity events and all that.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:06.000
Like I try and raise money for breast cancer by dyeing my hair pink every year.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000
And then we do something for cancer research.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:17.000
And I haven't done nothing for two years, but we used to do collections for the homeless.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:23.000
But I still advertise and things like that for the homeless on my Facebook page.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:29.000
And on my radio show, I present a local radio station.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000
I'm a presenter on there, Rhondda radio.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:38.000
And every so often I will mention homeless on there and things like that.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:46.000
And basically when people get in touch with me, they ask me to advertise for them for something.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000
If it's a charity, we'll do it free.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000
But if it's anything personal, there's a charge.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.000
So yeah, we're still doing, I'm still doing my little bit.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:01.000
And yeah, I love it. I do. I love the Rhondda.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000
And you've worked all your life in the Rhondda?

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000
Oh yes, yeah. I worked all my life.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Well, I worked all my life and I'm still working.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:14.000
I should have retired last year in November, but I've continued working.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:20.000
And I'm thinking of retiring later on this year in April, maybe June.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.000
We'll see how things go, but nothing's definite.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:30.000
But yeah, you know, it's quite surprising that I started off in the retail trade in the co-op.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.000
And I'm going to finish off in ASDA in the retail trade again.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:42.000
But in between, I have worked for several different companies as a salesman for just rentals.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.000
And later on they were called by ASU.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:53.000
I then worked for a company called, what was the other one?

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000
I'm trying to think of the small company I went to work for.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:01.000
They were selling Hoovers. They were selling Kirby Hoovers.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000
Kirby's, and I couldn't stick it there.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:10.000
They expect us to sell a thousand pound Hoover and expect a little bit of commission.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000
And I said, no, it's a con.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:17.000
So I give that up and went back to Granada, where there was a second state.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.000
I stayed with Granada for another nine years.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000
I was with the co-op for 15 years.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000
Then I worked for just rentals for three years.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000
Then I went to Granada for nine years.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.000
And I went to work for a German company called Mullatec.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:40.000
And I started off as a warehouse worker, forklift driver.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:47.000
And they put me through a little bit of training to do Six Sigma.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000
It's a green belt.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:53.000
It's like a continuous improvement course and things like that.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000
And I passed it.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000
And they made me a trainer.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000
So I used to travel, you know, travel.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Well, it wasn't traveling actually.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000
I was just doing all the training in Wales.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:15.000
And they asked us to show around the Japanese who came to visit.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:22.000
And the guy who owns Toyota himself, his name is Toyota.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:27.000
And he came dressed up in dungarees and all that.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000
And he guy, he's a multi, multi billionaire.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.000
But he was dressed like any worker.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.000
And they asked me to do a presentation.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000
And I said, what?

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000
I said, you're joking.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000
I said, I've never done anything like that.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Well, he said, you do the manifest every day.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.000
All you've got to do is just explain what you're doing.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000
I said, oh, God, here we go.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:56.000
Well, me being cheeky, you know, I made a good impression.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000
So when I finished, I banded everything ready.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.000
Got it all for shipment, signed it.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.000
And they said, oh, thank you and all that.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.000
They went away.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.000
And next thing I know, there's a Tanoy announcement.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.000
Could Nasir come up to the office?

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000
So I went up in the office and everybody said, yeah, come on in, come on in.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:22.000
And all the Japanese guys moved their chairs for me to sit down.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.000
I said, no, no, I'm all right, you know.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000
No, no, they wanted me to sit next to the boss.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:32.000
So I sat down next to the boss and I could see all my bosses looking.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000
And I was looking at them.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000
There's nothing I can do.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000
They just, and my boss just nodded to me and winked.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000
He said, you're all right, don't worry.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:47.000
And they were asking questions and I was telling them slow

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000
because he couldn't understand his interpreter.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000
I had to tell him.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.000
And I just said to him, I said, what do you think of me?

00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:00.000
What do you think of me getting all the parts ready for one of the best cars in the world?

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000
And he laughed then.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000
He said, you reckon it's a good guy?

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000
I said, I think it's a fabulous guy.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000
I said, I've driven it once.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000
Oh, he said, we'll have to arrange for you to drive the others.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000
So we got quite chocked here now.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.000
And it went so, went really well it did.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000
And when I went back down, they said, oh, you're going to have food?

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
I said, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, you stay.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000
You're having food.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000
So anyway, I stayed for food and everything.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:34.000
And when it all finished and they all went away, the German boss came downstairs

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.000
and he called me and he said, come on, they want to see you in the office.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
And I said, oh, no, what have I done?

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:44.000
Automatically thinking I've done something wrong.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.000
And the guy who owned the company, Mullatec, his son was there.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:54.000
He looked after the Welsh end of it and the European end of it.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:59.000
And he said, and he shook my hand, he said, absolutely amazing.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.000
He said, you did a fantastic job.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000
And he said, they were so impressed with you.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.000
They really liked what you did and the way you did it.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:12.000
And he said, the way you were explaining everything, that's more,

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:16.000
they understood more of that than what you were making jokes.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:21.000
He said the humor side of it, but he said the explanation of it all,

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000
the way you described it all, he said they were more pleased about that.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000
So brilliant, that's great.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:30.000
And that's when they offered me to become a trainer.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.000
Fantastic.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000
And I become a trainer.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.000
And then we had another contingency from France who came to have a look

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000
what we were doing and all that.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:45.000
So again, they picked me to show them how I did everything and all that.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.000
And because I'd been doing this for quite a while now,

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:54.000
we were there in the office and I just said to them, I said, look,

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.000
if you want any help, I said, just give us a ring and I'll guide you through.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000
It doesn't matter.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.000
So a couple of weeks down the road, a couple of months down the road,

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000
I was called into the office.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:10.000
I said, you know the people we had here from France, they need some help.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.000
Will you help them?

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000
I said, yeah.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000
You want me to phone them?

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.000
No, no, he said, we want you to go out to France.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.000
I said, what?

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000
Yeah, he said, we want you to go out there and train them.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:23.000
So yeah, that's great.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000
I said, the only thing is I haven't got a passport.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Nobody said we'll get it for you and they applied for it.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000
They made every sorted flight, the lot.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Well, I got to France and well, yeah, they asked me to go to France.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.000
I said, yeah, okay.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:45.000
Anyway, when I get to France, I find out the warehouses were half a mile down the road

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000
and they said, yeah, we'll take you down everything.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000
They picked me up from the airport and all this, like, you know,

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:59.000
and quite away from Paris Airport, like Charles de Gaulle, it was called.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:06.000
So anyway, when we got to the warehouse, there was nothing in there, nothing at all.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:11.000
Not one shelf, just a wooden warehouse, all wooden.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.000
I said, well, I can't train anybody in this.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000
I said, you've got nothing here.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000
Oh, no, no, we don't want you to train anybody.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.000
That comes after.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000
I said, what do you mean?

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.000
I said, I've been told I've got to train nine people.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.000
No, no, he said it'll be quite a lot of people you'll be training.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:34.000
But we want you to set this up like you got in Wales.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:39.000
I said, what? You serious? Yeah, we want you to set it up.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:44.000
Because what was happening, the Toyota Yaris was being built in France.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000
And they wanted me to build up.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:56.000
But they wanted me to do it in a way so they had rocking for Renault, rocking for Nissan,

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.000
rocking for all the companies they were dealing with.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:03.000
But my main aim was to set it up like it was in Wales.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:07.000
I thought to myself, oh, my God, I've never done anything like this.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:13.000
So I phoned Germany and I said, listen, I thought you said I was training nine people.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.000
But I said, you realize there's nothing here.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Well, of course, we thought we told you.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000
I said, no, you didn't tell me.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.000
He said, we want you to set it all up.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000
I said, well, I don't mind.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:29.000
I said, it's going to be a challenge because I've never done anything like this.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000
Oh, you can do it.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000
Well, yeah, I'm going to have a go.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:38.000
But I said, I need somebody then who's going to be interpreting and everything.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.000
And when I need things, who do I order it with?

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000
He said, the manager.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.000
You just tell him what you want and we'll give him the budget to do it.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000
I said, all right, OK.

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:54.000
So I thought, right, OK, now I know what I'm doing.

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000
Well, now I know what I've got to do.

00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I'll have to sit down, go through my mind, what we need, what we've got to do and all that.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Now, the Six Sigma, I also did through a Japanese company called the Kanban System.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:22.000
And it basically you got to make the parts and tell them when you want it, when you need it and all that.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
So I was stumped.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Now, how am I going to do?

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Now, you've got a warehouse half a mile away, factory there.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
How do you correspond?

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
You can't keep going on the phone all the time.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Anyway, I said, right, we'll do that.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I said, can I have today off?

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I need to find a hotel.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Oh, we've done it all.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
He said, your hotel is booked everything.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
So, all right, OK.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
So they took me to my hotel.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
First, I went around meeting everybody.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I met the manager.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Then I met the assistant manager.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Then I met all these different people in different offices.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
And then they took me to the factory.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
And there was a little pedestal there where you stand on the pedestal.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Say hello.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
How are you?

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
So, brilliant.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:20.000
So I thought to myself, you know, this is and he said the interpreter, they give me, you know, Lionel in Britain, you know, he's my interpreter.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Six languages, they could speak.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Fantastic guy.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Really nice guy.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:33.000
So he explained to me, he said, you know, when you come to work now, he said, you go to the manager's office, you say hello to him.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Then you go along, say hello to everybody.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Then you go into the factory and say hello to everybody there.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
All right.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
All right.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
OK.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
I said, yeah.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
And he said, come and meet this young lady.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
This is our secretary.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
You need anything done.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
She's the lady for you.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
But I'll be with you.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
So anything you need to do it.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
I will do it.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
I said, all right.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
OK.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
I said, look, I'm a bit tired now.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I've had a bit of a shock to what I got to do.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
So if you don't mind, I'll have the night off now.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Relax, enjoy.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
And then we'll start in the morning.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I said, can you pick me up?

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Yes.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Yeah.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
He said, we'll send the car for you.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Great.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
So the following day, I just went through the motion.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Hello.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Fine.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000
And I told him, I'm going to send the car for you.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Great.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
So the following day, I just went through the motion.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Hello.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Fine.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
And I told him, I'm going to send the car for you.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Hello.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Hello.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000
And I told him, I said, well, look, we're going to need racking.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000
We're going to need to mark out how we're going to do everything.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Anyway, blah, blah, blah.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Then it all great.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Mark out the floor first.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:36.000
And then I said, we'll get the racking up, but we don't want to bolt it.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Because what I want to do is try it out.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
And if it doesn't work, we can move the racking so it's not bolted.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
And we'll be able to do it.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
I said, I need a forklift driver.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
All right.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
OK.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Down comes this lady.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
I said, I need three.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Down comes another lady and another one.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
I said, oh, you got all lady driver.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
He said, all production is done by men.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
All driving on forklifts is women.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Oh, right.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
OK.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I said, can you tell me why?

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
He said, the women are more careful.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
OK.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000
So I told him, look, I want this moved.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
They're moved anywhere.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Great.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.000
And you know what I liked about the French was, when I left them a list at the end of

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:27.000
the week to say, look, I want this done by the time I come back, I had no hassles at

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
all.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
It was all done.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
It was all done.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000
In fact, you now would phone me up and say, oh, look, can I do this?

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Can I do that?

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
So they were doing a lot more.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
But when I did that in Wales, I had hell of a time.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Hello.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Just wouldn't listen.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
How many years did you do that job?

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Nine years?

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Yeah, nine years.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.000
That's right, nine years.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I enjoyed it.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I did really enjoyed it.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
And what I enjoyed most was thinking on my feet.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:11.000
And one of the problems I mentioned was the distance between the factory and the, and

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
do you know how I solved that?

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I happened to be sitting in the hospital.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Yeah.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
And when you're in a waiting room, what do you notice most?

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Trullies.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
No?

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
No.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:29.000
You've got a light going round telling you waiting time is four hours continuous.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Yeah.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Right?

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
And then it goes red and it tells you a different time.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Then it goes green and green.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000
So automatically it's going green, red, green, red, green, red.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:44.000
And sometimes you notice the amber on the side.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
I said, that's what I want.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Traffic light system for the parts.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:57.000
So when I went back to France, I said to the guy, I said, let's go in the workshop.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:02.000
So I noticed, looked around everywhere and say now, for instance, that's the manager's

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
office.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.000
And this is a big wall up here above the machine.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Opposite the manager's office, yeah?

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Yeah.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Right?

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Opposite the, I said, that's what I want.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
So I phoned him up.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
I said, I want the manager.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000
I said, not the workshop manager, the main manager.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I said, I want a 65 inch TV, please.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
And I want somebody who's good with the internet.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Yeah.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
So we went to the warehouse.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000
We put the TV up on this side, connected to the internet.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000
I went to the warehouse then and I said to him, I said, right, what I want you to do

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:46.000
is send a message to that TV screen, right, with a big red dot.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Right.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
So he did it.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
And he picked up the phone.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000
He said, I just seen this message.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
What are you going to talk for?

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Can you see the message?

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Is it clear?

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Yes, that's great.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:06.000
So I designed a system that when we need a part, right, it'll show red.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:15.000
The part number next to it will be the tool number, right, and the quantity of parts.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
And it'll go along, right?

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:23.000
So every time we needed parts, which was red, if they got the parts ready, he'll put it

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:31.000
on number and when it gets to the warehouse and it's in stock there, it'll go to green.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
So everybody had a job to do and they didn't have to phone each other.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
It was all done internally on the internet.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
I said, we're going to try this now.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000
So I said to him, I said, what parts are we going to need urgently?

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
And he mentioned some parts.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I said, right, give me the number and that.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
So I told him what to do and he put it all on there.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000
And he came up on the screen and the manager seen it and he said, that's what I said.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Yeah, you can see it.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
It's telling you what we need.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:04.000
But I said, don't forget now when you're actually doing the parts and you've got the amber,

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:09.000
you've got to calculate how long it's going to take you to get it to the warehouse.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
You don't want to leave it too long.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
So anyway, I loved it.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000
I did.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:19.000
But then when I came back, there was a young boy who would just come out with a little

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:25.000
boy who would just come out to university and he become my manager.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Apparently, while I was away, there was a bit of a dispute or something.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000
And the guy who was the manager, they demoted him to some other department.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:40.000
And this boy took over and he was all knew it all and all that.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.000
And the first job he said to me, he said, oh, I got a thing by for you.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
He said, look what I did right by.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
So what's that?

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
He said, oh, the Nissan still edges.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000
I've devised this now to put all the still edges there.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
He said, you know, look, I said, yeah, great.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
I had to look at it.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000
And as soon as I looked at it, I went, it's not going to work.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000
What do you mean it's not going to work?

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
I said, it's not going to work.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000
You're going to be at least 12 still edges out.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Can't.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000
He said, I measured them all.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I said, yes, I can see you measured them, but you've forgotten the cups.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Got a cup on top.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
So the leg would fit into the cup and he wouldn't slip.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Well, he had measured them.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
That was half an inch out.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000
So because I showed him up a bit, he didn't like it.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Now, I didn't try to show him up.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
I just told him because it was only me and him and he didn't like it.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
And he made things hard for me.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
In the end, I just thought I got to get out of there.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Can't stick it.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Yeah.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Yeah.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
But I love my job in Asda.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I absolutely love it.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
It's absolutely.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:54.000
If my health wasn't bad, honest to God, I would stay there as long as I can.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000
The customers are just amazing people.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000
The bosses, my manager, S Jackie born.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
She is just brilliant.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
She's so fair and lovely.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
She she'll help you as much as she can.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
If she can't, she'll tell you straight.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Sorry, you can't do it.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
I love my job.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000
But the customers are Asda's customers.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000
They're all my friends.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000
And I get recognized all over the world.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
I go to Benidorm.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
I get people.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Went on a cruise to the Mediterranean.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Hey, that's brilliant.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:37.000
They either know me from the TV, Asda or on the radio.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000
OK.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Yeah.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
I love it.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000
I do love it.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
So Ronda is your home.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Oh, Ronda is definitely my home.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Yeah.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Definitely.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
And all the Ronda people are my sisters and brothers.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Oh, they are.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
They definitely are.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Yeah.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Lovely.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
And you've got five children.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000
I got five children.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
And how many grandchildren?

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Thirteen grandchildren.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
And how many great grandchildren?

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I got four at the moment and I've soon to be five.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Five.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Gosh.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Yeah.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000
I don't look that old, do I?

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
No, you don't.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000
You and I are the same age, so I would never say you look old.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
You don't.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Yeah.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Fantastic.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Yeah.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
I love it.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
I love the Ronda.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
And I got some lovely friends.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:31.000
And I genuinely honest now, if I was in trouble and I was to put anything on my social media

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000
or all the phone numbers I got, I can have somebody here within minutes helping me.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Yeah.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Honest, it's been brilliant.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Brilliant.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:48.000
And I just hope now that things will work out with my health and I'll make a decision

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000
then whether to retire and enjoy life, you know?

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Yeah.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Yeah.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
So, yeah.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000
But I can't imagine that you will just be sitting around.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Oh, no.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000
You would always do something.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
No.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000
I definitely will be.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:09.000
If I retire, right, I won't say if, I'll say when, because I intend to retire, I will

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:17.000
probably do a little bit more radio work and I'll do school work because a lot of schools

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:23.000
hire us and we take our trailer to the schools for the music and the discos and things like

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000
that.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000
That's from the because of the radio.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000
For the radio, right?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Yeah.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:35.000
And we do occasions like the Christmas fair, when the radio gets involved with that.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000
We do the Christmas markets, the one the radio gets involved with that.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.000
So, I will have something to do all the time, you know?

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000
And me being mouthy, they normally throw me in the front end anyway.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Yeah.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000
So, yeah, I'll probably be doing a lot more.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Like at the moment I'm doing Monday, Tuesday and Saturday shows.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:07.000
If it comes to the crunch that somebody's on holiday, I'll cover their show for them.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000
When I'm on holiday, they'll cover my show, you know?

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
So, with a bit of luck.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000
It's lovely.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Yeah.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Yeah, sounds really good.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Yeah.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000
I enjoy it.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000
I do.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000
I am hoping, because I've noticed there is so many Asians moving to Rwanda.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Oh, are they?

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Oh, there's every corner got a shot now.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Oh, really?

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Honestly, you want to see the Asians who moved in here?

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Yeah.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:40.000
I am hoping to start an hour long program with just Bollywood songs.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Oh, gosh.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Hour long, just Bollywood songs.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000
But I'm going to pitch that to the manager.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
In fact, they wanted me to do that about two years ago.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
But because there wasn't a lot to ask.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Do you know what?

01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:02.000
My best, my favorite listener for Bollywood songs is a German lady called Sabine Kommerl.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000
All the way from Baden-Baden.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Oh, that's okay.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Every Saturday she'll text me first thing in the morning,

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Nash, don't forget my Bollywood song.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Okay.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000
How are you today?

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Brilliant.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000
That's it.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
She's a physiotherapist, she is.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000
And I met her in India five years ago.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Okay.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000
And we kept in touch.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
She's brilliant.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Thank you so much for that fantastic interview.
