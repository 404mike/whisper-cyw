00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.840
Newport as a town, well it was doing well. Even though the Tories were in governance

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.800
and you would have thought that Newport would have been economically compromised by that.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.560
It was winning awards for the best cap town in Britain or in Wales. There was a sense

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:36.120
of civic pride for a short time there. It's kind of lost its identity and once a city loses its

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:47.120
identity it loses its soul and then it becomes like this desiccated and dead post-industrial town.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:55.160
I still see Newport as a town even though it became a city. That's when Cardiff decided to

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:03.040
dismantle the art scene in Newport and assimilate it into Cardiff. I'm not saying that there are

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.000
many patterns there but yeah Newport was wonderful back then. It was wonderful. I'm not looking at

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.360
this through rose-tinted glasses either. There was still a little chewing gum on the streets

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.720
but it wasn't as peppered with it as it is now. There wasn't broken glass, there wasn't a plague

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:32.600
of drug addiction, there wasn't syringes littering the streets or empty tents sitting in the doorway

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:42.160
of vacant shop units. All the shops were open, all the pubs were thriving. All roads led to Newport

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:57.520
rather than all railway tracks leading to Cardiff. 88, it was vibrant. There was quite an energized

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:06.360
subculture that rotated around the art college student community who were involved in all these

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:18.840
activities like throwing borderline illegal raves below pubs in Newport. The Carpenters Arms in

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.960
particular. There was a Slaughterhouse downstairs and there was this collective who used to put on

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:35.000
raves and dance nights down there. I think the collective was called UFO. That was in 1991.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:44.920
They all developed around that period, the late 80s, early 90s. It was a fascinating period.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:57.240
You had gothic folk horror rock units like Wicker Man doing their thing and Dean Bettis with the

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:04.200
Cowboy Killers. I think the abs were still in circulation at that time. At that time,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.280
John Peel's favorite band. He worshipped the abs and understandably so they were a brilliant band.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:18.440
Over a period of time, things changed. Having a Labour council for a prolonged period of time has

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.840
led to a political entropy. They made it very difficult for John Izzicolo to put on gigs for

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:32.600
the last 10 years of his career before his death. The police were actively in operation opposite

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.560
venue in the hope that they could close it down. All because of some

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:48.280
apocryphal stabbing event that tragically led to someone's death on their Clarence place.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.600
It was just a case that they associated a subcultural, uncategorizable and somewhat

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:04.120
troubling phenomena like TJs as an enemy. They were gunning for it from the late 80s onwards.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.920
The student population no longer exists in Newport. The Welsh Assembly decided to absorb

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:20.280
most of the art departments who were instrumental in creating the subculture that made Newport so

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:27.720
fascinating from the mid 80s to the mid 90s. They dismantled it, took it apart and absorbed

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:35.000
it into Cardiff in an attempt to sustain the illusionary cultural heganomy that that capital

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.200
city has. I don't want to go into politics but it has something to do with the Welsh Assembly and

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:47.560
something to do about sustaining an illusion of Cardiff being an international city. Of course,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:56.040
no international city can exist without a thriving subculture and they did their utmost

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:09.240
and gradually succeeded in absorbing all of those creative artists who were sustaining the scene in

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.920
Newport.
