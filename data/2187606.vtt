00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
There were about five of them.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.760
Where were they from?

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.400
Maltese lads.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.480
Oh, right.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.040
You picked them up where?

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.120
Yeah, because they were building a regiment up there.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.080
And you see the regiment was only...

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.440
Because my friend who lived in Tipperary Gloucestershire,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.680
well, he's a bit of a silly one,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.240
I used to say, you actually want to join up

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.960
and make a man of yourself.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Next thing I knew, in 1954, I was with him.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.920
He was only...

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.280
What are you doing here?

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.360
Was in camp there and he's coming.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.640
He said, I've done what you said.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.360
He come to my 80th birthday.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.920
Down just after.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.080
So where did you go from Malta?

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.720
It was Busan.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.320
I think it was Busan.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.760
What was this trouble in the Suez?

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.760
What was the trouble you had in the Suez?

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.880
Oh, all along the banks of it,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.560
you saw the Suez, you know, gerrym and all that.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.000
And the...

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.640
I don't know where he was, I can't remember,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.160
some officer said, get your weapons, you know,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.680
and we're over there waiting to see

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.280
if there's going to be any trouble.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.080
That's what happened.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.240
So that was about the time...

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.800
Oh, that would have been just before the Suez crisis,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.720
wouldn't it, the year before, if I expect?

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.000
Oh, it was before.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.280
That was before, that was in 1956, wasn't it?

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.120
Yeah.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.880
Yeah.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.720
You went to Busan then?

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.760
Yeah, well, I was supposed to go to Suez,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.840
but I didn't get there.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.880
You know, I went to Busan.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.200
I got off the boat, right?

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.080
There were several of us got off.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:25.160
And that's where there was personnel, Korean, not Chinese.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.520
And I remember him saying now,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.280
why do you come here to kill us?

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.320
And we said, we aren't coming here to kill nobody.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.200
That's a fact.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.760
And I reckon that's where that picture come from.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.080
Well, he was only out there overnight, you know.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.920
And the ship was then, time to say,

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.360
oh, we was back down to Japan then.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.360
And what the ship was doing was picking up personnel,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.520
which is due to go back home.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.400
So, they never got off at Mombasa.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.400
The ship went on.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.760
Dropped us at Mombasa.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.440
We went all the way up by train, right away, up to,

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.040
well, at Nairobi.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.280
And we picked up all our luggage and taken to GoGo.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.960
The camp.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.560
It's dark. Now you go on the call.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.760
If you want, yes, because I was willing with a major sort

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.320
because I was a barber as well, and I used to cut all their hair.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.560
And I used to cut his hair as well.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.520
One day, they had this big ballroom going on.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.760
This is in Kenya, the camp.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.920
And you'd be surprised, the bus that comes in there

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.120
with women. It was incredible.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.160
And these officers, I think, I guess we did.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.080
Oh, wow. You went mad.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.200
I said, don't worry.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.720
This is honest truth, I said,

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.720
because I'd done this for the sergeant as well,

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.880
Sergeant Miles, is burn the cork, piece of cork.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.680
You just go like that and just rub it like that.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.240
I said, hey, have a look.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.040
Oh, God, that's honest.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.640
Yeah. Well, I got that from my father

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.800
in the First World War.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.400
They used to do that, burn cork and all that,

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.680
to cover up any wear and tear on the harness,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.280
from harness on the horses.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.000
Because they used to get a lot of bollocking for that,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.200
didn't they?

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.000
And quite rightly.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.440
And quite rightly.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.480
Yeah.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.000
Don't hurt horses.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.720
Yeah, but I think it was some Greece

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.920
and they just rubbed it in.
