00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
I'm Vicki MacDonald and I'm at Holy Trinity Church, Llandudno, during the longest yarn.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.960
And I'm speaking to Wendy Lonsdale, who has memories of her parents during the war.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.120
Wendy, what do you want to tell me?

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:21.640
Well, I was born in 1941, so I was always called a war baby.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:30.960
My mother used to, we lived actually in Porta Gueste and we had an antique business in Port

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.120
Madoc.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.920
So when the phony war came, my mother panicked and thought that the Germans were going to

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.480
land on Black Rock Sands.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.760
And so she started taking all her valuable antiques down into the cellar until I think

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.480
my father told her not to be so silly.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.160
So that was the first story that I can recall.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.560
And I do remember that my father was in the Home Guard in the first few years of the war

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:17.120
and he was stationed up below Snowdon, near Capelkirig, guarding the line, the pipeline,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.160
which was water.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.560
I gather it was water.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.560
Yes.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.720
But I didn't hear very much about that.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.840
And then at the beginning of the war, anybody who had a house with a spare bedroom was told

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:43.440
they had to take members of the services or they had to have somebody to live with them.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.120
So my mother decided, or evacuees, so my mother said, oh, well, we've got the premises,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.120
above the shop.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:57.520
We'll go down to the shop and live over the shop in Port Madduck and we'll let a family

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.480
come and live in our house in Borthogest.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.800
And I'm not quite sure how long we were there, but I was born over the shop.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.280
And I remember my mother saying to her mother, well, I don't remember this, but she told

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.240
me this, that, oh, I can't possibly have a baby over the shop.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.720
And my grandmother apparently said, you'd be surprised where you can have a baby.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.680
So during the war, obviously, I was a baby.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:36.440
And my mother took me on the, I think we must have had a, we went by taxi, I think, to Liverpool,

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.640
because that's where her mother and father lived in Liverpool, but not in Liverpool itself,

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.760
out in Great Crosby.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.600
My grandmother apparently used to say, they'd telephone and say, do you think it's safe

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.200
to come?

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.080
And my grandmother said, well, there haven't been any bombs recently.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.460
I think you're safe to come.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.360
So then apparently we were, I was taken as a baby in arms up to Liverpool.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.720
And as soon as we got there, the bombs started dropping.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.140
And at nearly the end of the war, my father had then been called up because he was older.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.500
He was called up and he was in the Royal Corps of Signals and doing, learning how to do

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.860
codes and things like that.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.020
And he was, I remember he was in Scarborough.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.820
And for some reason we went to stay in Scarborough.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.380
We went on the train.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:37.760
And I can remember going on the train and all the soldiers on the train, sort of making

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.140
a big fuss of me because I was a little girl.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.220
And we got to Scarborough and stayed there a few days, I suppose.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.340
Those are my earliest memories.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.740
You told me one memory about your mother and the knives.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:59.060
And yes, so because it was an antique shop, she had a lot of, well, knives, very obviously

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.060
very dangerous knives from the Far East.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.380
And there were Dutch commandos stationed, I think near Harlech.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:18.420
And they came into the shop and wanted to know if she had any sharp knives because we'll

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.580
get the so-and-so's.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.660
They were going out to the Far East.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.660
They were stationed.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.300
And she sold them, the knives.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.580
Oh yes, yeah, she sold whatever she had.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.780
She was glad to get rid of them, I think.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.780
What else was?

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.980
You had, your mother had quite a busy wartime.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.820
There were other memories?

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.700
And the other, yes, well, so then talking about the being, because I was born in, over

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.140
the shop, as it were, the house was, she obviously...

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.820
Sorry, I stopped the tape for a moment.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.100
And Wendy's going to continue.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:03.380
Just to say that a family came from London and lived in our house during the war.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.380
Evacuees.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.540
Well, I suppose you'd call them evacuees, but yes, it was a family.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.380
It was instead of having soldiers, I suppose, because otherwise we'd have had soldiers living

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.380
in it.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.140
And it was a very nice bungalow in Borthogest.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.140
So thank you, Wendy.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.380
Thank you for your wonderful memories of the war and your mother's war as well.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.780
So did she survive it all and the antique shop stayed open after the war?

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.980
Indeed, yes, until 1950s.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.980
Oh, that was lovely.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.980
Thank you so much.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.980
Thank you for doing that.
