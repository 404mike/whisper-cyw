00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400
It's important to understand that the race riots in Wales, the race riots in England,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.480
were not totally in isolation and they're treated as if they were in isolation.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:22.220
But much was happening in America at the same time and much was said about that.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.640
But there are things that connect them.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:35.960
So, chapter 17 and 18 of our project will relate to Elaine Arkansas, the brutal events

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.960
of 1919.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:47.040
And for that we link our work to the superb work of the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.080
And this is narrated by the actor Ozzie Davis.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.080
This is part one, Elaine Arkansas.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:17.000
In October of 1919, one of the greatest tragedies in American history occurred near the town

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.840
of Elaine, Arkansas and Phillips County.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.200
We are certain that a reign of terror against the black population of that part of Phillips

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.960
County took place.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:36.320
We are certain that machine gun crews went out looking for people to gun down.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.360
We are certain that blacks were brought into, in effect, concentration camps and held in

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.360
all violation of all the laws of the state of Arkansas.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.360
For the next 80 years, many people, blacks and whites, preferred to pretend it never happened.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.360
Colored people had more fear than they've gotten now.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.360
A lot of things that they were scared to just read or talk about.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.360
Thus, not only was a major catastrophe ignored, but even more important, the legacy that rose

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.360
out of its ashes was also forgotten.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.360
My name is Ozzie Davis and I'm an actor.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.360
I was born in Cogdell, Georgia in 1917, two years before the tragedy in Elaine.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.360
Yet, despite geographical differences, the world of rural Arkansas was not much different

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.360
from the world of rural Georgia.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.360
Both were part of the South.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.360
Then a region where black people were segregated from whites by custom and law.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.360
As a black person, I was forbidden to eat in the same restaurant, study in the same school,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.360
pray in the same church, or be admitted to the same hospital.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:02.360
Like every other southern black person, I was expected to learn my place as a second-class citizen.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:10.360
And if I didn't, calamity could strike me down suddenly and without warning.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.360
I still remember the terrifying stories I heard as a child of how white men in white hoods

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:26.360
burned crosses, whipped, hung, and burned to death black men and women who had transgressed the racial codes.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:34.360
To me, these tales always carried with them the smell of burning flesh.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.360
In the South of my childhood, whites considered the cotton fields the best place for most black people.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.360
White planters needed cheap black labor to grow and pick their cotton.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:55.360
Among the richest fields in the world are hundreds of thousands of square miles of land in the Arkansas Delta.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:03.360
The men and women who work the land are supposed to receive half the cotton crop in exchange for their labor.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.360
But many landlords cheat them out of their rightful share.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:15.360
The man would take your cotton, and then the man that stole your credit, he'd run the books up on you, so you didn't have nothing.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.360
You worked a whole year and hand-picked 40 pairs of cotton and come out with nothing.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:30.360
They kept him in debt, this black or white, particularly blacks, and he never did get out of debt.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.360
So he might be living on the same plantation for 10, 15, 20 years and never get out of debt.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:46.360
They'd whip you like a dog or something, they would do you just like you would do an old dog a hog or something.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.360
This is the way things were in the South in the early 20th century.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:59.360
But although nobody knew it then, the winds of change are rising, set in motion by a catastrophic war.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:12.360
In 1917, America enters World War I, which Woodrow Wilson proclaims will make the world safe for democracy.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.360
Black soldiers fight with courage, bringing honor to themselves and their country.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:26.360
As they return home, they are greeted with the fiery words of the black leader W.E.B. Du Bois.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:34.360
By the God of heaven, we are cowards and jackasses if we do not marshal our brain and brawn

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:41.360
to fight a sterner, longer, more unbending battle against the forces of hell in our own land.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.360
Whites react violently to this new militancy.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:59.360
In the red summer of 1919, so-called because blood flows in the streets, race riots erupt in over 350 cities.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.360
In Chicago, 23 blacks and 15 whites are killed.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.360
In Washington, D.C., four whites and two blacks.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.360
Whites are astounded that blacks dare to fight back.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:27.360
On the night of September 30, 1919, in Phillips County, Arkansas, a small group of black men and women

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.360
are also planning a fight against their oppressors.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:37.360
They have organized into a union, the Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:47.360
Their plan is to sue their landlords for money owed them for their crops and for an itemized accounting of their charges at the store.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.360
But the farmers' plans are known to their enemies.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.360
Even as they meet, two white law enforcement officers arrive at the church.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.360
Shots are fired, and in the confusion, a white man is killed.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.360
His death triggers a massive reprisal.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.360
Terror reigns. Whites falsely claim blacks are the victims of the war.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.360
Whites are the victims of the war.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.360
Whites are the victims of the war.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:28.360
Terror reigns. Whites falsely claim blacks are in a state of insurrection.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:36.360
A local white sheriff sends out a call for men to hunt Mr. Nigger in his lab.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:46.360
The call went out for Mississippians to come to the rescue of the white men in Phillips County who were under severe attack.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:55.360
And so they jumped into cars and they jumped into trains, and at least according to the oral sources that I've talked to, they fired out of the windows at every black they saw.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:01.360
Women in the fields, it didn't matter. If it was black and moving, it was target practice.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.360
Hundreds of farmers are trapped. Among them is Frank Moore.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.360
The whites sent word that they was coming down here and killed every Nigger they found.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:19.360
There were 300 or 400 more white men with guns shooting and killing women and children.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.360
Farmers are not the only target for the mob.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:30.360
Dr. D.A.E. Johnson, a prominent dentist from Helena, Arkansas, and his three brothers are seized.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.360
They're chained together in a car and shot to death.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.360
Soldiers from the U.S. Army eventually restore order.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:47.360
By the time the shooting ends, officially 25 blacks and five whites are dead.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:09:00.360
Some say, however, that as many as 200 blacks might have been killed, their bodies dumped in the Mississippi River, or left to rot in the cane break.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.360
The stench of the dead can be smelled for miles.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.360
Officially, blacks are blamed for the riot.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:26.360
The general reaction of the white establishment in Phillips County in the aftermath of the riot was a charge that was leveled against the black population

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:38.360
that they were in a secret conspiracy to rise up and to overthrow the white power structure and the landowning class in eastern Arkansas.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:49.360
I think the Elaine riot was about the fact that black farmers in Phillips County were tired of not sharing the wealth that they were producing.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:55.360
And the Progressive Farmers and Household Union was an attempt on their part to share the wealth.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.360
Because white men have been killed, more black men must die.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:09.360
Hundreds are detained, 67 are sent to prison, and 12 are tried by an all-white jury for the murder of whites.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:21.360
As the trial begins, a mob surrounds the court building, warning the court that if the accused are not sentenced to death, the mob will lynch them.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:37.360
For a black defendant to go into that atmosphere was almost ridiculous in the sense that they hadn't even talked to their attorneys who had been appointed for them.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:48.360
For example, in the first trial, the attorney stood up and said, ladies and gentlemen, I hadn't even talked to my client.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:57.360
There's always been the effort of the establishment in the South to always maintain that black people get a fair shape.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:09.360
And the basic story is that when you have a black person charged with an offense, the judge would say, well, you know, boy, I'm going to make sure that you get a good lawyer.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.360
Then I'm going to make sure that you get a fair trial, and then we're going to hang you.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.360
And that's in essence kind of what happened in the Elaine case.
