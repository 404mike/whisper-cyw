00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
The End of an Era

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.720
The ownership of the Alfa had given me a chance to try out other cars and marks with various

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.920
impressions. I wasn't to know it at the time but my next choice would be my last company

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.880
car. One car supplied to me while the Alfa was resting was a Mercedes saloon, a not particularly

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.680
exciting one but I had been impressed with the comfort, power and build quality. So when

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.120
it came the time to make my next choice I went into the Mercedes showroom in Sussex

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:38.240
to look at the array of gleaming machinery on offer. Among the wide choice of strange

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.880
bulbous A-glasses and large saloons, estate cars and posing style convertibles was a new

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:52.320
four-seater two-door hatchback coupe simply named the C-Class Coupe. My wife had admired

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.920
an S-Class Coupe in another corner of the showroom and coming over to the one I was

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.520
looking at that was some tens of thousands of pounds nearer the spending allowance my

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.120
company was wasting on me, she immediately said this one's a better colour. So we sat

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.040
in it, established the hatchback boot could accompany our dog without the need to try

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.240
it as he wasn't of a wolfhound's physique being a collie cross. The next week the garage

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.360
was generous enough to lend me a demonstrator model overnight and I was impressed. Performance

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.840
felt sporty but more refined than the more aggressive alpha which had a higher power

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:36.200
output and I suspect was lighter. Checking this I found the curb weights are 1330kg of

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.960
the alpha to 1480kg of the Mercedes and a higher brake horsepower for the alpha of 190

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.480
to the Mercedes 163. The sensation of speed was increased in the higher rev in Italian

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:57.240
by the exhaust noise. The engine in the Mercedes was a smaller 2 litre compressor petrol unit

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.120
with the air to the engine being I was told supercharged. Unfortunately the engine itself

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.400
looked like a central heating boiler and was a let down after the alpha of Isolée but

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.480
then the bonnet was only ever opened to top up the washer so the disappointment was infrequent.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.120
To reach my allocated budget I was able to specify a large electric glass roof which

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.480
made the interior lighter. I also ordered the automatic gearbox which unfortunately

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.040
left no money from the Mercedes very expensive leather seats so these were a pleasant light

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.600
grey mixture in cloth. I was shortly to regret this when a red wine bottle incident with

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.040
the shopping left an embarrassing stain on the rear seat and caused a faulty seatbelt

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.720
warning message due to the liquid getting to the sensor. The sympathetic dealer sorted

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:55.000
both out and I think that was the sum total of mishaps in the car. The car was attractive

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.480
but less showy and less dangerous to drive than the alpha and it didn't seem to upset

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.200
any of the company hierarchy by being in the company car park. It was to be my last company

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.480
car and maybe in the final year of my employment I had conformed and chosen a dark colour German

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.520
car like many others there although it was a previously outlawed two door with a glass roof.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:24.320
It was pleasant to drive, roomy for a coupé so when I took early retirement I considered buying

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.120
it off the company. The combination of a higher residual value coupled with the knowledge of being

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.320
driven as a company car, see above about opening the bonnet to check the oil, eventually persuaded

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:46.440
me against this course of action. Another Mercedes, a Mercedes 300 CE Coupé. I retired early and

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.560
wasn't yet ready for pensioners car and already having entered the dangerously seductive world

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.160
of classic car ownership I started to research whether it would be possible to own a future classic

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.200
that would give the benefits of a modern vehicle. My conclusion was this dual purpose could be

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:12.120
provided by Mercedes 300 CE, a large pillarless coupé in deep midnight blue metallic colour with

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:19.920
a 3.0-litre 24 valve engine and uprated to include remote entry alarm and CD multiplier to add to

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.240
the list of factory fitted extras. These included an electric steel sunroof, a full leather interior,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:33.680
automatic gearbox of traction control, headlamp washers, seatbelt arms that slid out electrically

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.760
when the door was closed because of the lack of central pillar. The car when new cost over £50,000

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:46.760
which would be approximately £90,000 in present-day money and its solidity and power felt like it.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.400
It cost me £5,000 and felt like a bargain. It was fast and comfortable long-distance cruiser,

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.080
we even had a whole day in France in it, something I never did in the Espace. The spec was impressive

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.240
and for its time must have been close to the pinnacle of auto refinement. It couldn't be described

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.280
as economical but that was the payback for the power and weight. The engine output was rated at

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:21.000
220bhp with acceleration to 60 in under 8 seconds and a claimed top speed of 145mph. It wasn't so

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.960
popular with the rest of the household including the dog who slid around on the leather seats and

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.320
wasn't impressed by the visibility of the coupe styling, although the electric seatbelt feeds seemed

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.080
to intrigue him. In retirement I was doing a little bit of consultancy working involving travelling

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.840
around the country so I was able to enjoy driving it without complaints from either of the passengers,

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.400
canine or otherwise.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:53.560
Gallic madness. My second car bought in retirement was an even rarer creature, a Renault Aventime.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:00.160
This has been quoted as an example of a concept car being put into production and quoted by others

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.720
as the product of a rush of Gallic blood to the brain that should have been resisted. In retrospect

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.600
it frankly was quite bonkers but when I first saw one I wanted to own it and I'm not really sure

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:19.240
why. The concept was to create a four-seater luxury tourer that was around the size and similar body

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:26.200
shape, a teardrop monoblock, to the Renault Spouse Pipera carrier. But by lowering the suspension,

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.880
installing the 3.0-litre six-cylinder engine, they'd created an early sports utility vehicle.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.440
The concept car design included two large cantilever-style doors that moved away from

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:44.120
the car body before swinging open. The cabin was particularly light and airy with pillarless

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:50.120
side windows and two huge glass sunroofs, one of which opened and both able to be shielded

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:57.400
by electric fabric blinds. The idea of a pillarless four-seater with a large open sunroof may have

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:03.000
been conceived for posing along the Corniches in the south of France but the buffeting from the wind

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.920
coupled with the ready availability of exhaust fumes on the roads in Sussex tempered the enjoyment

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:14.360
of this. Although the global closing function where all four windows and roof would close at

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:21.480
a single touch of a button was a nice party trick. Similarly the choice of engine giving 220 brake

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:27.240
horsepower to the front wheels also gave a certain amount of excitement with the power being beyond

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:33.320
the handling of the car. There was a claimed top speed of 140 miles an hour which I think would be

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:39.400
terrifying although it would be very tempting to overtake a lowly slung sports car on the autobahn

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:45.400
at that speed whilst looking down through the large windows from your leather armchairs. The

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.920
interior was as futuristic as the exterior with the dashboard being relatively minimalistic.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:58.120
For the time 2002 the car was luxurious and very well equipped with parking sensors,

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:05.000
sat-nav system, huge glass roof with electric blinds, cruise control, headlamp washers,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.640
electric heated seats in tan leather, climate control and a good music system. The music

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:17.560
system was hidden behind a dampened lid and except multiple CDs which it swallowed one after the other

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:23.480
into the bowels of the car. Music could be controlled by the steering column or by a remote

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:30.440
control handset, very Gaelic. All the controls were in odd places, the climate control near the front

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.880
right hand side of the driver on top of the dashboard with the passenger override on the

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:41.880
passenger side. The switches for the heated seats and door mirrors were both somewhere else and many

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:47.480
of the controls and positions didn't seem intuitive so that coupled with the surprising power for such

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:54.440
a high vehicle made the driving experience a strange one. Again as with some other cars I've

00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:00.920
acquired I like to think it was a bargain. When new it retailed at close to £30,000 but after

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:07.240
just three years the price had dropped like a stone to the £8,000 I paid for it. I'm afraid that at

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:12.680
that time there were some inherent electrical problems with Renaults namely the coil sets which

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:18.520
appeared to be fancy plug leads so that the car would occasionally shut down power to one cylinder

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:25.400
and go into low power limp home mode. Reading posts on the friendly Aventime Owners Forum

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:31.400
revealed this to be a relatively common problem so much so that I carried a spare coil set in the car.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:37.480
After experiencing this three times myself I reluctantly felt that after less than two years

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:44.440
ownership the car had to go. It seemed a shame as it was the only other car that I'd had along

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.800
with the split screen VW that it was expecting not just to wave to each other but to stop and

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.840
have a conversation and this happened to me a couple of times. I'm sure it would also have

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:59.880
happened with the Volvo ES but I can't remember ever seeing another one whilst I was driving it.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:07.080
I guess with total production worldwide of 6,000 it was also unlikely. I was told that only 200

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:12.840
Aventimes are sold in the UK market so I was probably statistically unlikely to meet many.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.680
I would like to say that the Aventime is the most eccentric and rarest mode of transport that I'd

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:27.080
owned but sadly this isn't true. It was possibly mainstream compared to the Carabao. I understand

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:32.360
that the car was futuristic enough to be used in the sci-fi film Children of Men and some were

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:38.520
destroyed in the production reducing the 200 total even more.
