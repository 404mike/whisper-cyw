00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.280
Hello, this is a project from the HDA in Cardiff and it's about the memories, the people, the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:20.120
recollections of how life was in Cardiff Bay, the docks and Bute Town in days gone by within

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:27.240
living memory. And we'd like to say thank you to Heritage Lottery for providing that

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:38.840
bit of funding that allowed us to undertake this short project. This is part three of

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:48.280
the recollections of June Wagstaff, former landlady of the paddle steamer, the Boatsun,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:56.120
amongst many other things. Now the quality on this isn't as good as we would want it

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.680
to be. The problem is during Covid we had to do these recordings over the phone, over

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:12.360
mobile phone and this I think is the only one that wasn't totally and absolutely clear.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:22.120
But it is worth a listen. June is one of those people who was the heart of Tiger Bay, one

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:34.520
of the members of families and groups that made the place, well simply that, they made the place.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:42.240
This is June Wagstaff, this is part three. First time I had a banana was at Barry Dock.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:51.040
Yeah, actually that's how we had the banana contract from Barry Dock. For donkeys we had battles,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.840
we had suit battles and suit shots. So we had the banana contract and we used to feed all the other battles

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.240
and we'd buy a lot and we'd buy our home, right, Nima? Oh yeah, we used to have a certain

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.240
large mom as well. No, they don't like their estuipine. They're a bit priceless now.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.960
When there was Christmas, people in all of the fruit markets would along there

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.280
and then I'd be there with my father, with bananas, they got to have it kept at the same temperature.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.960
There used to be long wooden boxes then and they used to put those night lights in there

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.200
to keep them at the same temperature. But today the bananas in the supermarkets,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.160
they go black and they're dirty, that's terrible. And the taste is not good. Well I tend to buy them

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.120
green now because they only do ripe in a couple of days you know. Yeah, but when you think about

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.920
those things, the simple things that appeared around the docks that other people didn't

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.480
really see as much, you know, some of the food and stuff like that. No, but then they weren't interested

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.880
in the whole lot of them because you know what, I'm telling you, near the entry house, they'd always be

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:18.640
on the coat for the kids, you know. A lot of the kids didn't, it was just there for them, you know, and it was in line.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.280
You know, they'd keep it to the kids. I feel sorry for the kids today, they haven't been,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:33.200
well we all have, I haven't been taken to. I'm still the same, no, I'm black with bananas thinking

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:43.680
why I'm cooking so cheap. Yeah. It's a habit. And I don't know about you, but as you get older as well

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.000
and you're cooking and there may be just the one of you or two of you, I can't cook for one.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.920
No. I try, I try, but I can't get it right. I can cook for a family.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.440
Oh, there's no such thing as pork or pork or something, you know, I must go think some things later.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.120
Yeah. Because my daughter runs the carves radio.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.640
Oh right, yeah, of course, I've spoken to her once. Do you know her? I don't know her, I've spoken to her I think once.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.560
Yeah, we asked her to give me a ring, but I don't ask her to give you one, but because I don't know.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:29.360
No, I think I've got her number, but we'll see anyway. But yeah, yeah, I think it, what I'm interested in

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.360
and we're interested in on the project is, is the history and it's just disappearing. Yeah.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.080
And that, that's what the point of this was. It isn't really, it's a bit odd really.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.360
Because it's, it's like I've done the most sound ones, because it's really nice.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.680
You do, you sell Welsh also June from the bay. You can read it.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.640
But, but people need to hear the voices. But that comes from jobs.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.120
They need to hear that. You know what I mean? They need to hear the accent.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.280
The accent. The way people talk.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.240
You don't change your accent. It's not the same now.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.120
You adapt so you can hear what you're talking about.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.320
All over Cardiff.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.560
Yeah.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.920
No, it's odd, you know.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.280
Oh yeah, yeah.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.040
So you're moving up the road now.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.680
Yeah.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.880
My family moved up the road.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.920
Oh, you're doing great.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.280
Great, great, great.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.480
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.280
I'd like, I mean, I've lived with anybody.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.680
Yeah, well, Port was the next one up the road this time.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.720
Yeah, we just drive through.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.040
The pub's gone now. It's not here.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.560
Drive through Dynaponte.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.640
Yeah, that's right.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.240
Yes.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.960
My family.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.440
I used to drive to Cardiff nearly every day because my mother was still going to the doctor, you know.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.120
I knew just how I'd gone to Australia when I went to Pantry.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.000
What you going up there for?

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.040
A lot of people have got family up the valleys, haven't they?

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.200
I mean, I've got family.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.240
My granddad became a miner. He's buried in Gatlinger.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.020
Yeah.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.080
But we, you know, we went, the people went where the work was as well.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.440
Of course.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.720
Of course. Yeah. Of course they did.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.000
The men never stopped working and the women never stopped working.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.600
No, no. No.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:24.800
Because if there's any of those old families of mine who say I can't do this, my family and I was all night to see, they went to times.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.160
But I still watch it again.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.300
Yeah.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.480
Well, the husband's just gone.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.200
But I think, I think the people from the valleys, and you'll have seen them come to your pubs.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.160
They get...

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.360
Oh yeah.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.760
...come to Cardiff, particularly on a match day, and they're more comfortable.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:49.280
They were more comfortable, you know, the men from the valleys going to the bay than they were drinking in the middle of town.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.880
People are welcome.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.440
Oh yeah.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.560
People welcomed them.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:59.040
Well, when I was at the pub in Oxford this time, they said we'd be waiting for you all our lives.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.040
No, no, no.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.280
No, no, no.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.280
We make a lot of friends at night.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.520
And men are just all type of people, you know.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.800
A good sense of humor.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.040
Yeah.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.760
That's the thing.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.400
Yeah.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.600
Without humor, you'd never survive.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.680
Oh no. No.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:21.920
No.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.000
I mean, I've got friends who say I don't understand what people say in Wales.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.720
I say, what do you mean?

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.160
What does now in a minute mean?

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.200
What...

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.000
What?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.400
What?

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:32.800
What does...

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.960
Someone said the other day to me, I'll go to our house.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.560
I said, well, you go to your house.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.440
I said, what does it...

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.600
What do these little phrases mean?

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.840
I said, well, we should know, and we think they're as funny as you do, but that's not the point.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.520
No.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.520
Oh yeah, because I'm good at singing.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.320
I'm good at singing.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.520
Yeah, never mind.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.160
So, you've...

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.120
You've...

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.120
Obviously, you got married to your husband.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.120
We're only the second husband now.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:09.600
Yeah.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.880
I have two children for my first.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.840
You're right.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.840
And I got one for my second.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.560
And grandchildren, obviously.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.440
Boy, they're lots, yeah.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.400
I got two granddaughters and three grandsons.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:31.920
And my daughter got two children, and my son got three children.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.160
So we're well blessed with grandchildren.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.880
Well, I got great-grandchildren.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.360
And they...

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.360
Well, you could go to them.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.360
You know, you wouldn't need to go to them.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.360
Oh, no.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.360
I don't know.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.400
I'm just trying to get over it.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.840
What does it feel like?

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.120
Because I wanted to talk to her.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.120
Having grandchildren.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.120
Yes, she's lovely, Rachel.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.080
I go to two of my great-grandchildren.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.080
She got a mother and a boy.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.080
I bet you never picked one.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.080
No, of course I didn't.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.080
It's funny how I spend so much time with my wife.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.080
I don't know if I did that long.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.080
Hang on, I'm in a desk, going now.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.080
And I confuse this with me.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.080
I'm just hoping I'll be like my father.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.080
It's funny, isn't it?

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.080
Right, yeah.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.040
I'm just being this...

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.040
As my friend of mine said the other day...

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.040
This is another thing I don't like about getting old.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.040
I'm only doing this despite the government.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.040
No, I can't remember.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.040
I'm not even talking about my life.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.040
You say that.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.040
I guess in old age pension, that's about all.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.040
And then, you know, we've got a quite a good lifestyle, haven't we?

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:49.040
So, you work in the middle of the day.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
You're working from the valleys now, then?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Well, I can do...

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Is all your family gone from the valley?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
They're all in the valley.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
So, it's just me here.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
I've got grandchildren as well.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And I'm in no hurry to have great grandchildren.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Let me be clear.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Well, I love them, but they just came.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
I adore them.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
I do. I love them.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
My children, my grandchildren, and my great-grandchildren.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
I love them. I love them.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.960
Well, I mean, soon, hopefully,

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.960
at least for the summer,

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.960
we might be able to have gatherings again.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.960
Yes!

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.960
Yes!

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.960
It's lovely.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.960
That's something the Bay's famous for as well, isn't it?

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.960
Funerals.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.960
Oh, my God, yes.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.960
Yes.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.960
I did the Ticacus funeral. It was huge.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.960
So, which pub were you running?

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.960
The Barber's Funeral.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.920
Ah, the Barber's Funeral. That makes sense, doesn't it?

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.920
Yes.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.920
Paddle steamer for a musician to have the funeral.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.920
That makes real sense.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.920
Yes.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.920
Well, I was in school with one of these daughters.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.920
We got one daughter, Sir Donny,

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.920
she's the eldest, the daughter of Donny.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.920
And there's another younger daughter,

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.920
Janice, she was in Charleston, I believe.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.920
But I haven't seen her for a long time.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.920
And I was in school with Josie.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.920
Right.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.880
She was born in the same street as me

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.880
and during the day we all came to the funeral.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.880
Yeah, my mother wouldn't go.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.880
That's why we were the last house in the street.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.880
No, so we went from there,

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.880
my grandmother, to the hottest floor.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.880
We went upstairs, Masonette,

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.880
but she didn't really like it there.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.880
She died while we were living there,

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.880
my grandmother.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.880
And my mother then

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.880
didn't like it,

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.880
because she'd gone off to Christina Street.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.840
You call it Christina Street

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.840
and we all would go to Christina Street.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.840
It's the same as Sophia Street.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.840
No, Sophia.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.840
Yeah, Sophia Street.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.840
Yeah, Sophia Street,

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.840
Mariah Street.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.840
Yeah.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.840
But it's like, you know, my Nan used to stand up,

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.840
she used to lean

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.840
having a cup of tea

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.840
outside the house on the steps.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.840
Yeah.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.800
Everybody had passed by.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.800
You can't do that in a Masonette.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.800
No, no.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.800
It's a full house.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.800
Yeah.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.800
You know, you could always,

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.800
as the women,

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.800
we were still 1952.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.800
I think we were the first women in the street

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.800
to have a child with them.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.800
And then, the big one,

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.800
I was sitting on the corner with the shawls

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.800
with the kids playing, and they'd chat with us.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.800
And that's all they had.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.760
I think the grounds were never empty once you got the first telly.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.760
No, no.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.760
No, no. It was like a similar one now.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.760
Now, I used to come on going to those clubs.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.760
Yeah.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.760
You know, when she just started.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.760
Yeah.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.760
And we used to come in.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.760
Particularly on a sports event.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.760
Yeah.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.760
My mum, we had a telly when we were living

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.760
in the East End of London.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.760
And it was about the third in the street.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.760
And on Grand National Day

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.720
or FA Cup final day,

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.720
you couldn't move in your own house.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.720
No.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.720
You couldn't go because you couldn't move your feet.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.720
And it was no good if you were a kid come back.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.720
Say, no, I was sitting there.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.720
Well, you're not now.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.720
No, I know.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.720
Yeah.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.720
I don't know if you want to talk.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.720
Okay, let me finish by asking you a question, right?

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.680
And I ask everybody this.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.680
Okay, so you've got someone

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.680
near sat at one of those

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.680
places on Mermaid,

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.680
what's it, you know, the new...

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.680
Mermaid school.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.680
Yeah, the new place where there's

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.680
the restaurants and the pub,

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.680
you know, all of that.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.680
What was the dogs?

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.680
What would you say to them

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.680
they should know about the place

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.680
that they're

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.680
that they've just got

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.680
passed through to get there and sit down?

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.680
And you talk about music and that?

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.680
Yeah, it was fabulous.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.680
Because those pubs...

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.680
That's all I can say, you know.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.680
Those pubs don't have music.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.680
Those pubs don't even have music,

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.680
most of them.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.680
No, not anymore.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.680
But a lot of pubs did when I was young.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.680
Yeah.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.680
Yeah.

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.680
Okay, June,

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.680
I'm pleased we were finally

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.680
managed to speak to each other

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.680
and I'm grateful.
