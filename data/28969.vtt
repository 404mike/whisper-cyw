The men would be involved in the sport, rugby, football or bowls depending on their age and ability.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.320

The Miners Welfare Hall was the main centre for family entertainment before the late 1960s.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.040

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.440
as they were not allowed to play in their black and this was the only way they could be sure of getting a game later on in the evening.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.240
The aim of the Miners Welfare Hall was to provide a means of social intercourse within the community.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.520

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.760
billiard table and large dance hall.
