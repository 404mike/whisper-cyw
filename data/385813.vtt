00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Felly, roedd yn ymwneud y gwaith?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Dwi'n cael steil ar y llorri ar gael ymlaen.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Mae'n rhaid i'n gweithio ar y lle.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Durham, Midlands, Leeds, Sheffield.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Pan dweud yw, wedi'i gwneud steil i Sheffield,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
mae'n rhaid i'n gweithio ar hyn o bryd.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Oherwydd roedd yna ddwy steil mwy.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Yna ddim yn y pethau ymlaen.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Ond roedd yna steil mwyaf o'r gael.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Roedd yn gallu cael unrhyw un.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Roedd yn mynd i gyrraedd cymharu a phranc,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
roedd yn y pethau o'r llorri ar gael y llorri.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Roedd gennym ni'n cael ymlaen o'r lle,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
i Durham, i'r docs,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
a'r Midlands, ymlaen, ym Mhermenghwm,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Caerdydd, yn y pethau.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Yr unrhyw un ydym ni'n mynd i'r lle,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
yn fwyaf, roedd Kent.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Yn oed yna, mae gennym steilwyr yna.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Roeddwn ni'n cael ymlaen o'r lle,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
yn y pethau o'r llorri,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
yn unrhyw un, oherwydd roeddwn ni'n cael steil

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
o'r lle, i Sheffield, Leeds,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Lincoln, Durham.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Roedd yn unrhyw un,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
roedd yn bach o 30 oed o bryd.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Roedd yn eithaf, gyda'r nagu.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Ond yn y 80au, roedd yn cael ymlaen,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
oherwydd roedd gennym ymlaen.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Roedd yn ymlaen, felly mae'r company

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
a'r cyfan oedd yn dweud,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
roedd yn dweud, roedd yn cael eu gweithio yn y ddwylo.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
A roedd yn dda iawn,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
roedd yn gwybod i ni gwaith.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Yr un ydym ni'n cael ymlaen?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Mae'n gwybod.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Mae'r ddau yn bwysig, yn bwysig.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Roedd Sunators Smith.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Cyhoedd gorffor fel hyn.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Roedd yn dda iawn,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
roedd yn ffwould i'w disguisio,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Mae Fair spontanw JR innen,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.960
roedd yn organized

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.660
well, he said to me, he said to me, he made a message to me, get that fellow in the front

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.920
wall, he said, keep on moving, he said, go back down!

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.920
No that will get rung down, you know.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.060
I said you can't do that, you've hurt the poor bugya.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.100
So the next thing, this guy, there's a company down in Dresford, there's a milk company

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.300
but they also carry, well it's said they also carry stuff on the flatbed trailers as well.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.860
And this guy gets the union book, gets hold of the mirror like that, and climbs up, and

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.540
as he climbs up the fellow, I thought he was going to hit him so he grabbed him by the

A'i dweud, beth sy'n digwydd?

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.540
Roedd yn dweud, mae'n rhaid i'n sgwyl ar y llwy.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.540
Roedd yn dweud, beth sy'n digwydd?

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.540
Roedd yn ymwneud â'i gael ar y can, ar y can.

Roeddear y tui fel ddi altaru ati, tri ol

ac am 40 mlynedd o bobl.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.940
We've got an ingot, a great big ingot, there's one on the top line there,

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.140
it's about two and a half tonnes, something like that.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.380
We used to carry six of them up to Spearing Jackson's,

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.140
for them to be in the old as well.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.440
I think we'd go back a couple of days later and bring them back here for rolling.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.980
I could never understand that,

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.080
because most of the stuff that we could do was what we could do here, you know.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.680
But it was a situation where...

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.720
sometimes you knew the night before where you were going,

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.080
sometimes you didn't.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.180
Sometimes you'd come in and the boss would say,

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.280
his nephew's had your load, he's only gone to the Midlands,

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.140
and you've got to go to Lincoln.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.380
Lincoln cross country, from here.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.240
The only fast road you could call it is the A38,

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.480
which is the dual carriageway that runs to Derby and Nottingham.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.680
There was no big motorways, so you went the long way round.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.040
They'd always give his nephew, or there's two nephews, Graham and Philip, the easy jobs,

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.280
and they'd have the best wagons.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.880
There's a 40-odd-year-old lorry there.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.480
That's the GKE lorry, it's the company that had it, if you haven't.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.480
I'll show you now.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.180
That's the gas for the company at any point.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.180
That's the guest king of the night-opera's wagon.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.080
But exactly the same type of lorry we had,

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.680
with the same type of trailer,

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.980
but not to the tip of the left,

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.180
we'd have to put a magnet in and drag the stuff up and down and get it emptied that way.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.880
And they were pretty rubbish.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.380
Won't pull you that off.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.980
He was carrying 32 ton overall with the load on the vehicle.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.980
And especially when he went up to sort of, like, bleeds up the motorway,

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.880
he'd have more of his witting past, he'd have more weight on.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.080
And he thinks, yes, I've got to, you know, what is this like?

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.480
But with these trailers, this is the drop side, they never drop side, they're solid.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.580
This one's a tipper, there's a ram at the back of that to sit up.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.080
But we didn't have that, we just had the one for attempting with magnets.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.480
But there was a couple of steel stockholders as well,

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.080
we used to take the steel to,

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.980
and then they would sell it on to whatever company wanted it,

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.780
whether it was in this country or abroad anyway.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.880
We'd just sell it to Germany.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.480
And they'd just sell it, hang on, two anomalies there, Sheffield,

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.680
the biggest lot of steelworks in the world, not enough.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.880
And Germany was one of the next second biggest, the Roar Valley and all this, you know.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.180
And you often wonder, what the hell you were doing.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.680
It was a job, I suppose, you know, we did it.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.480
But we should bring the stuff back in,

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.780
I mean, these are magnets here full of coke and stuff,

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.980
way down there, they'd go down the road, right down here,

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:25.680
and there should be a scrap bay, we should pull in the scrap bay and load it there.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.080
All sorts of stuff.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.880
And of course, when you stamp something,

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.680
it's a bit like if you do pastry, there's always a skin around the edge of it.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.080
And when they were stamping crack chaps and congoats with the engines,

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.980
there was always that little bit left over.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.480
So they did bring that back as well to different companies.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.980
That would keep the work slow and scrap from all over the bloody place, you know.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.680
They were even fetching it at one time from up to here.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.880
You know, and I thought, well, it was something.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.380
They were cutting ships up in the one on the coastal town,

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.280
I'm not sure which one it was, on the west coast.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.980
They were cutting ships up and they were bringing pieces like that.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.780
They'd cut them up into squares and then bring them back to this country for de-melted.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:10.280
Which I suppose is recycling in the way, you know.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.880
I mean, it wasn't a bad job.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.480
It didn't pay very well.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.280
I mean, this was £70.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.880
I'm looking at my pay packets here.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.780
I've got to hire my hoarder to keep things delicious.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.980
I know I shouldn't, this is called preserve.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.380
And I've got a pay packet from 1979

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:29.680
and I was taking home £23.70 for a week.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.980
That was working a 50 hour week.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.280
And how much would that have been now?

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:42.080
Well, if you got paid the rate now, it'd be on about maybe £200 a week.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.780
But then, I suppose it was a job and just carried on.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.080
But the GKN lads were on £40 a week more than us.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.080
And they had, well, except for that for anything, they had decent wagons.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.880
And they were changing their units and track trailers every couple of years.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.780
Where, I was with Moss.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:02.180
I can remember the wagon I'd drive, it was TCA Travel 4J,

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:07.980
the old J, red with the sepix on the end there, not on the beginning of it.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:13.580
And it was a 1960 wagon and I was driving a 1978, 79.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.680
And bearing in mind, it's a total mileage.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.980
A lot of hard mileage pulling heavy loads.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.880
Not like your car, see you're standing here, you're going to step around the country

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.880
and clock up maybe 10,000 miles in a month.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.480
These have got 100,000 or 1,000 miles and they were going around the clock again, you know.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.980
Did you have much problems with them?

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.480
Yes.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:40.480
His motto was, if it's not broken, don't fix it.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.980
You know, you hear a noise and you think, take it to the fetter and the fetter says, what's wrong with it?

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.480
Oh yeah, and before the fetter had something to do with it, leave it until it goes.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.980
Now bearing in mind, you went just nipping round Wrexham.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.280
You went to Lees, you went to Durham.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.480
And I had one of these go, a wheel bearing collapsed on the trailer there.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.480
And it was on the M56.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.980
So I had to pull on the hard shoulder.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.480
Of course, as soon as I...

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.480
You never place them around when you want one.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.480
As soon as you stop, they're coming out of everywhere, you know.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.980
And this cop said, what are you stop for?

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.480
I said, the bearing's collapsed.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.480
Well, if I follow you, can you get to the next service station?

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.980
I said, no, the next service station's at 10 miles off the road.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.980
I said, it's dangerous.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:20.980
Oh, what are you going to do?

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.480
I said, I've just phoned you on them radio-dose phones you have on the side of the motorway.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.480
Anyway, the boss come with the fetter.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.480
And he said, what have you done to it?

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.480
I said, I don't know, I was sitting in the cab.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.980
He said, you must have done something to it.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:34.980
He said, it wouldn't go like that.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.480
I said, this is the trailer.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.980
I was telling you about a fortnight ago, and it was just making noise.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.480
Now the bearing's collapsed.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.480
And the wheel, the two wheels up it were on the side of the road.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.480
It's just as well it was that side, and not the road side, otherwise it would have gone through some weird care.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.480
But he just wouldn't listen.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.980
So did you ever meet Raymond then when you were here?

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.980
Not until he'd come here.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.480
I mean, the works was a big site, obviously.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.980
How many people do you think were at that time?

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.480
Somebody asked me that question.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.980
How many people worked in Brombeis?

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.980
I said, about half of them.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.980
At the end of the, when it closed, there was just over a thousand.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:17.980
I'd say there was just two and a half thousand somewhere, two thousand, two hundred, something like that.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.980
But there were a lot of contractors as well.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.980
You'd have contractors coming in to do certain jobs.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:28.480
The electricians would be doing their job, their own electricians would be doing their job.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.480
And if something else came up, they'd have to put electricians in because they wouldn't have enough to cover.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.980
And you imagine the site.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.980
I mean, that's what you'd thought, so that's all the way there.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.980
From there, right over here, all the way through to there.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.980
All that there, half a thousand.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.980
But all that there was a steelwork site.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.980
And you could have, maybe four or five electricians, they'd be working on something there, there and there.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.980
And then somebody would go round here.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:55.980
So they'd sort of drag somebody from upside to do that.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.980
But this office block here, I've got to have that down.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.980
Because that would have been a hell of a good youth centre.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.980
And I mean a good youth centre.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:10.980
There was two big canteens there, where the kids could have played pool, table tennis, McGovernies or this way.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.980
Office space, the lot.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.980
And they said, oh, it's in the way of the road.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.980
And I said, well, hang on a minute.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.980
The Romans left this country thousands of years ago and they were the only ones to build straight roads.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.980
I said, you can go round here, because the road's coming through here now.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.980
I mean, you've probably got to do with the box of the road a bit.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.980
It's a bit faster.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.980
A perfectly good office block, mate, built in the 60s.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.980
And they said, no, knock it down.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.980
When was that?

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.980
1993, 1994.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:43.980
I've got photographs of it somewhere, with the dates on somewhere.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.980
Bright money, and then I'd try to finish with a haulage.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.980
I worked in a company up here called Slagmere's Dock.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.980
It was separating the waste products from what could be pre-melted.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:13:01.980
And it's 23 years last month, on the 22nd of August, 1983, I had an accident.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.980
I got crushed between two naphtone pieces of steel.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.980
It did me in the pelvis, my spine, my leg.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.980
That's why I've got a character now in me, otherwise I'd fall over.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.980
It's not the falling over, but it's trying to get back up again.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.980
But it was a job.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.980
And the money there was brilliant.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.980
You were working on ships.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.980
They didn't want to work night ships.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:28.980
So they decided that it was going to be six to three day ships, and three till midnight.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.980
Now we'd have to do the bloody night anyway.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.980
So what was the problem with working nights?

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.980
It was on the day ship that day.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:43.980
And a guy got a hoist, lifted the steel, what do you call it, about 30-odd foot long.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:49.980
And I was standing next to it, in a hole like that, across the air, bang.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.980
And it just turned to face it.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.980
If I'd been standing side on, his pelvis would have folded in on me, gone to the specialist.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.980
And I was hit, finished.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.980
43, couldn't get a job anyway.
