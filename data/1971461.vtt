00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
The town wouldn't be here if it hadn't been for the port.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.680
If there hadn't been a port in Fishguard,

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.280
then there wouldn't be fishing here,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.680
there wouldn't be boats here.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.120
Because it's a sheltered spot to moor a boat,

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.080
that is why people come here.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.160
That's why the boats here, that's why they're here.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.520
It's been here for nearly a thousand years as a port.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.120
It's a long time.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.920
And if you look around the town,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.200
lots of the people who had the houses built

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.100
were all to do with making boats,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.820
building boats, mending boats, and so on, or trading.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.380
People traded from here.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.740
The main park in the middle of town is called Lotter Park.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.740
Lotter Park was bought by a sea captain

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.260
who made his money from the phosphate trade

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.540
around Cape Horn in Chile.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.540
He would go from here to Chile in wooden sailing ships.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.940
I don't know if they did it, goodness knows,

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.780
but he did it and they used to bring back phosphates.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.820
And that was used on the land here to improve the land.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.100
And it was a big step forward in agriculture in this area.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.740
The land became much more productive

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.940
because phosphates came in.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.500
They used to collect what was called guano,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.820
which is seabird droppings.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.740
But in Chile, they got enormous amounts of them

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.220
and that's what they used to do.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.100
So the park in the middle of town

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.300
is named after that trade.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.220
So all these, the amenities of the town

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.740
came from the profits made by the trade.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.420
So the trade, the harbor,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.340
was absolutely essential to the town.
