00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.960
What will I die with am I?

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.960
A flower like, made of flowers, magicians loved her now.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.960
Yellow gleaming of my hair, as sun bright as the green flowers, new opened in the spring.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:52.960
Dusty bloom on my soft cheeks, borrowed from the meadow's wood, the queen of summer fields.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:03.960
Shimmering depths within my eyes, green as the oak and leaves, fresh born at the loss.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:16.960
Scent of flowers in summer's heat, my breath makes so sweet, my kiss is sweeter.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:30.960
But deep darkness in me too, alone and laughed in marriage mode, to wait and to wait.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:40.960
Soft, softest feathers touch, my lips upon my lover's face, waking in the morning.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:51.960
Piercing scream of dying clever, speared my lover at kill's morning, blood red at sunset.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:04.960
From all as owls rending talons, the magicians changing touch, at midnight's darkest hour.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:16.960
Free forever now, I fly, leaving land and love behind, towards the dawning day.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:14.960
Thank you for watching!
