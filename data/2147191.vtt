WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
So the camera is rolling and again it's audio and video just as a record mostly audio

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.880
But the video is just there as well. So number one, I know you've introduced yourself already

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.080
But pronouncing Novelette

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.280
So can you for the sake of camera tell us what is your name?

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.200
And where and when and where were you born?

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.720
My name is Novelette Gordon

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.760
I was born in Jamaica

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.600
came to England

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.400
1967

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.880
To London grew up in London went to school

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.920
And I spent all my adult life in London

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.480
All my family are in London

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.600
I

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.720
moved to Wales 2004

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.840
What do you remember of?

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.840
What do you remember of

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.160
Before arriving in London, do you remember much of it?

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.880
I mean, Jamaica. Yeah, okay

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.080
I do remember some things but you know as you get older it gets a bit vague

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.040
but I

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.040
do remember

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.120
My family we were they were business people they cultivated sugarcane and citrus

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.680
And they were also active in politics

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.640
my great-grandmother my aunties and all that and

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.480
often

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.760
caused confusion as well because of the represented different party there were different party members and

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.520
Similar to England, you know conservative and Labour and you know why I should be in power not you

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.760
That kind of stuff. I remember all of that. I remember Jamaica Independence

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.560
I

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.800
Don't remember everything about it because quite young at the time

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.400
I was like about five tell me tell me about the place you grew up to the Clarendon

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.080
That is where I grew up in Clarendon and this was all going on

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.440
So what I'm saying is I remember I'm Jamaican independent

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.360
1963

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.040
I remember the cup with the German. I don't forget that

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.680
It was like a little cup

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.320
Metallic green, you know with the Jamaican cards of cult of arms on it and

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.360
You know we have this thing

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.160
It's like a whistle but we call it Fifi, you know

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.840
Something for the children to play with and all of that and it was like a big festival

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.440
You know like fun fair and all that I remember all of that because where's children, you know fun

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.080
That's what I remember I remember yeah, we lived in a big house

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.640
It was country life

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.640
But you know when you're truly you don't know about responsibility you just know about having fun

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.880
Do you remember what kind of things you did for fun as a child? So what games you played?

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.720
Well, I'm in the tree when you're not supposed to I'm falling out of it and you know something, you know the spade tire

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.160
When it rains you go on the hill and you sit in the tire to slide down the hill in it because children don't see danger

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.960
I mean we never had toys as such, you know, you had to create your own activities

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.920
And that's what you did isn't it hide and seek and and do all the naughty things that you're not supposed to do

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.720
are there any

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.920
But memories of cultural practices you have from Jamaica anything that you did there

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.560
I went to church, I come from a Christian

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.560
Tell me about that

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.560
My great-grandmother

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.560
my grandmother

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.560
you know

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.000
We we had you know, we had to go to church every Sunday

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.400
We had to respect the Bible. We had to pray every day. You always pray before you wake up

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.040
Before you go to bed at night

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.040
And you pray when you wake up in the morning

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.560
You give thanks and that is something that i've carried through my life as well because I myself

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.840
Was a Christian. Yeah, I did backslide a bit

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.360
You know when you you grow up and you don't have your parents tell you that you have to go to church you do your own thing

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.320
So yeah when I left home, I was going to church

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.560
And then when I had my children I found my way back into church

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.520
You know

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.120
When it comes to God I'll say you have to find when you find him yourself

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.360
You will know because in the end I didn't understand it until I

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Found it myself

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
You know, it's a different experience

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.760
Yeah

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.080
What did the average day going to church look like to you when you were young? Do you remember that?

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.760
Sunday school every Sunday. Yeah, you know

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.720
You put on your best dress

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.400
Everything had to be perfect on a Sunday you get

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.200
Nice food on a Sunday

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.520
Everything nice happens on a Sunday

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.520
You know the house we get cleaned

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.180
Friday shopping get done saturday

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:27.600
And sunday you don't it's like a rest day you go to church you come home and you have family dinner

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.320
and um

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.240
Yeah, and that that's our sunday was like a rest day and it was family time

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.960
Which I think that's what we're lacking

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.640
and

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.400
now because

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.880
Time has changed and we sunday was secret. It's not anymore because everybody work every day of the week

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.280
And there's no

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.280
No day put aside

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.800
Especially some of us. Yes, the older one, but that generation is dying out

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.520
But the younger people is adapting different principles, isn't it?

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.280
So tell me about then

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.640
The move from jamaica to the uk or london then

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:18.320
What was it? What was the motive? What were your motives? Like what was the reasoning? I don't know motive

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.400
What it was?

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.360
My grandmother and my grandmother had come to england

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.560
And then I was left with my auntie until they were able to send for me

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.000
And so that's what happened. The intention is that I would have come to england

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.200
You know my mom she was sent for me when she settled and that's what she did

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.360
Um when I came to england my mom she had

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.320
My sister she had a sister that was born here in england

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.120
So i'm the first born

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.960
Um

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.960
Yeah

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:03.040
What's the memory of that flight over um when you came on my own when you landed what did you feel

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.760
Cold it was cold

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.960
It was winter. Um

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.320
Well, yeah, it was just different environment, isn't it? I remember um

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.800
My mom she but my mom she recognized

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.360
Me because of the clothes that I had on she had sent it to jamaica for me

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.280
Everything that she had sent I had it on so she knew

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.080
you know and um

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.080
I remember she took me to we're living in shepherds bush at the time

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:41.360
And um, I remember she took me to the market and she bought me lots of nice pretty clothes. I don't forget the bed slippers

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.800
you know orange one with fur across

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.760
And all the bed slippers I was telling about it the other day actually yeah

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.160
and um

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.680
At that time, um, she was living my auntie shepherds bush

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.800
you know living a big house and all that and then

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.640
my

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.560
It wasn't long after that. My grandmother had bought her a house

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.280
in hackney

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.560
And then we moved it. We moved to stoneman

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.160
1969

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.480
And that's where I lived

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.720
Yeah, you know

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.600
So even though I left home when I left home at the age of 17

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.800
um

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.240
I only lived on the road from my mom when it was like I never really did leave

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.720
Home because it's like it was always in my life

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.720
And all that and if I wish to speak the truth, right?

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.520
When I moved down here

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.320
It's like I I felt like i've actually left home

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.920
Home

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.920
Is that that's when I became a woman

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:53.840
That's interesting so you didn't feel like leaving jamaica was leaving home you felt like leaving london was leaving home

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.480
Yes, well, I've you know, i've been going from nine years old and until

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.580
45 you know

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.720
um

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.160
because

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.360
You I mean you're asian so you you understand the entire family network

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.880
And everything the family is in it and whether it's for good or for bad

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.240
But sometimes you just want to be left alone to make your own decision

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.320
And give you know

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:25.280
Nobody's you know, you know relationship and they have something to say about it

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.880
You know and um

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:37.280
You know because we all have choices and sometimes we make good choices and we make bad choices

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.320
You know, but you still need to give people a chance

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.360
You know, you need to give them a chance to see if it's going to work, you know sabotage it before

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.760
Even get off the ground

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.480
So tell me about um

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.360
Then arriving in wales. What did that feel like when you first arrived in wales?

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.920
You just mentioned it briefly, but what was the feeling you you know, imagine your first trip here?

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.480
What did you feel like?

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.960
It was like a dream. I had to pinch myself

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:12.240
It was like because I felt and I still do even you know, it's because sometimes I think about it

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:18.080
Well, it was a brave move because the only person I had down here that I knew was my son

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.480
Nobody else

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.480
you know, um

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.640
And I was like, you know because my relationship broke down

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.280
And everything and you know

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.680
I didn't get to lots of support from my family

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:39.280
So I think that is why I was so down as well because the people that supposed to be comforting you

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.400
They weren't there in town or that's how it felt

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.120
Yeah, you know, maybe

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:51.760
My perception is wrong. I don't know but that is how it felt. I was on my own

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.400
And I just want us to

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.800
To go I didn't care where as long as I didn't live in hacking anymore

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.200
You know and um

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.680
Yeah, so that's why I I thought you know

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:11.200
That was a brave move to just take up yourself move into a city

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:17.040
you know, no nothing and I couldn't get a rental accommodation because um

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.960
Because I was working at the nhs at the time and you know, um

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.560
Your salary that you ate doesn't qualify you to to get social lives in

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.040
and all of that so

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.960
I had to buy

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.840
You know and which I didn't know that I had the ability to buy a house of my own

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.840
Yeah, you know, so it was like a dream because

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.640
I didn't know as a single mom

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.600
Because by now I am I was a single mom. Yeah, you know working

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.400
You know, my son was still in school at the time

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.720
and to you know, take up this responsibility and

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.120
You know, it's like I just say it could only be good

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.840
That's true

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:14.720
That's how I look at it, you know because it was like a dream and and sometime I nearly finished paying for my house now

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:20.560
and you know things that happened to me a lot along the way so it would be quite distressing because

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.720
And ill health came in the way as well and then

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.040
You know, so you struggle a bit of hardship not knowing

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:35.280
What tomorrow is going to be i'm going to lose the house because I don't earn the same money anymore

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.120
and

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.520
It was all sort of things but i'm still here

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:45.140
And i'm still here. I only work part-time everything else I do is voluntary

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.440
You know, um

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.480
And in this short space of time that i've been here

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.920
I am well respected people does appreciate what i've done and

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:04.080
I don't know. I'm sorry. Can you can you try and recollect maybe the first

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.200
Month in wales. What did you see? What did you witness? What did you experience?

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:17.120
Where place did you go to in wales when you first arrived? Well, the first month in wales

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.560
Because

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:25.840
I don't really thought about that. But uh, I was back and forth in london a lot because I still worked in london at the time

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.720
you know, because although

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.400
The intention was to get a permanent job down there

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.200
In the nhs or wherever at the time so when I first moved down there

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.880
uh, I started on did agency because

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.000
It helped me was to know my way around

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.480
And all of that, you know wells and and all that so yeah, um

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:57.680
The first month or even the first six months i'll say it was probably more work

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.880
It was more that than anything else not not

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.160
Enjoyed anything or I didn't know any place

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.320
as such

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.440
You know apart from where my son would take me like local shopping

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.240
And things and um

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.040
It was back and forth to work

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.920
Because even though um, I did agency work. I had my job in london

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:28.080
You know, which that was my main job. So I had to secure that

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.680
so, um, the agency was like on my days off

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.360
You know

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.520
And then one day, um

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.480
I went to town

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.040
and all that and then

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.920
What I noticed there wasn't really any black people. There was black people, but I didn't see them

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.480
Is is when I um

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.480
One day I went shopping in pill

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.240
And I saw the new testament church church of god

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.640
and I thought oh

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.640
Because that's the church I went to in london

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.920
You know, so um, I started going there

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.380
And um, that's when I met pastor freckleton

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.200
And they were very welcoming

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.640
And all of that and you know, there was stuff going on in the church and then

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:21.520
You you as you start going you start getting familiar with the the church members

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.520
And all of that until you start making your own friends

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.480
you know in church and

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.000
You know, I know it and people's inviting in places

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:39.600
And all of that and that's how I grew actually and I mean at one time the only people I knew was the people in church

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.360
Yeah, you know and

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:51.840
Yeah, that's how it was and then so why is faith so important to yourself

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.560
Sorry, why is faith so important to yourself today?

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.560
I

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:05.040
Don't really it's not something that I thought about I think it's just that it's within me

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.360
Uh, I believe that christ is in with you the spirit

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.320
son of god

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.800
It is it's the foundation

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.280
You know, it orders your step it keeps you in in line

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.720
You know to do the right thing in life

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:41.280
The truth because for me faith is about truth and love

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.480
and um

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.800
Love yourself

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.200
As others first you do have to love because if you don't love yourself, you can't love others

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.600
Um

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.720
I think faith is everything

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.880
It is the foundation

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:10.340
Have you maintained any customs and traditions then? I mean, I'm guessing the church is that from original jamaica

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.520
To london to my faith. Um, I wouldn't say um

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.520
What's the word

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.920
You know, um having faith it's it's it's it's not uh

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.880
I don't think it's it's got anything to do with whether you're black or white or asian

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.600
You know, I think

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
This is

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.200
It's something because even non-christians

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.560
I've met people who are non-christian. They don't grow up in christian home and they find faith

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.000
You know, you couldn't find it anyway

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.360
You know

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.840
I just think it's an experience that

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.040
It's an individual thing

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.200
It's not something that's easy to describe

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.560
Yeah, you know, but um

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.320
the one thing

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.520
But it's not hard. It's it's just as I said, um

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.280
Yeah, you know

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:22.240
Whether you're muslim or you're christian you believe in one thing live your life in truth speak the truth

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.040
Do good to others

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:31.120
And that is what it's about. Just just be yourself. Don't try to be anything else. Don't force it

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.920
So

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.840
Tell me about how these principles have led to the work you do today

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.640
So you mentioned about volunteering on another project. So i've always done that tell me about that

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.280
work you do

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.760
Maybe I need to go back to the beginning

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.200
Of my first

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.460
Trade was hairdressing I started as a hairdresser

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.840
and studied hairdressing for five years and

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.800
Practiced for 20 years

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.200
But even though I did hairdressing I always enjoy cooking

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:17.200
and you know making things knitting and all of that and

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.200
And then

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:27.620
Even even though I did hairdressing also did I went to college part time and then sugarcraft

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.760
making flowers

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.760
out of sugar

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.040
Baking and advance because my grandmother was a baker anyway

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.600
You know, so it's the heartbeat. Oh, I love that. I can't rub the sugar for me

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:46.480
You know, I know I said that's where the baking came from because my grandmother baked, you know

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.160
But I took up the sugar craft because you know when I was baking people said oh it's a shame you don't decorate

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:58.320
I know that's and that's what made led me to have the interest in sugarcraft and did that and then

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.040
you know and

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.880
And then even though I was doing hairdressing I had a friend who had

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.360
Was in the catering business and all that and because they know that I do stuff that we used to help each other

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.920
And I ended up having

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.440
a calf

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.400
doing Caribbean food and all of that and

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:24.000
Sometimes like I'll go and run my own my friend

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:28.240
I'm hairdressing shop and he'll come and work in the food shop for me

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.480
You know what I mean? So I could we help out each other and that's what was going on and then

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:39.280
Where I had this shop the counts was redeveloping the area in douleston and then

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.720
And then

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:49.040
So that's how I did give it up at that time although I was doing private work and then um

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:58.080
And and and and then when they they they did rebuild everything and all that

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.520
We could have gone back there, but it was so much money the overhead was so high and all I thought it was worth it

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:09.280
And I went to the job center looking for a job and um on the billboard they had um

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.520
Health care system required and trainer be given

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:19.280
And I applied thinking I was going to get a job because what do I know about working in a school?

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.400
right and um

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.800
That's what happened, but it was the best thing that happened because then um

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:34.160
Start working with the hospital and then um, I moved from job to job until I became um

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:41.840
A great mental health and I enjoyed the work and enough or i'm not meant to leave so I might as well do the training

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.200
And so I did my nice training mental health nurse

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.520
Right, but then all the other things that um that I used to do

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.280
Fell into place because then I was able

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.200
to um

00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:01.600
Look after the patients like cut their hair shampoo their hair make it look nice when their family come and visit them

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.360
And we had a social club so every monday

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.960
Because monday was quite damn cool the day after we came, you know the patients that will go there

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:16.640
And I'll go to you know do their hair who wants their hair shampooed and trim and all that

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
And then and then sometimes

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:26.240
You know i'll go to um like meetings to get money to ask for money to buy things to do that

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.800
They'll say oh, but the nhsa got no money

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:35.600
So this is not new thing the nhsa is having no money and all that so I had to do my own charity

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.640
So I do my own fundraising bake cakes cook food

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.880
And bric-a-brac and all that and I did it twice a year

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.040
and raised the fund to buy hairdressers and stuff and

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.720
And stuff for the group meeting

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.800
and all that

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.320
and that's

00:22:54.400 --> 00:23:01.280
How it really escalated and till it became a routine thing and then oh no, why are you not doing nothing this

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.240
Yeah, you know and um

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.960
I did it for my children's school

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:14.720
Yeah, you know like um bake cake and they sell it to buy books for school and things like that

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:19.360
And all that it just continued when I came to wales

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.720
You know um

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.120
Side life side life is a voluntary group

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:33.280
Because I became fishing when I became fishing impaired. I was going I was getting to various meetings and and all of that and

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.640
There's no no babbling. I don't know if you've heard of her

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.360
I am she's an option

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:46.720
I can't come to us. Yeah, that's what she is, but um, she worked in football

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:52.480
And she used to come to these me up, you know, and we used to meet up quite regularly and

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.360
I used to go to her talks and um

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.480
I wonder you know, we're talking about

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.560
People, you know, what can we do to bring?

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.240
Black people out so that they can talk about

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:11.760
Their vision impaired or what means they that I know that and and this other group

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.400
Came about three of us

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.800
Right started a group myself. She made me she mentioned

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.880
Pakistan at the moment we should probably be doing this and um

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.960
And yeah, the group started out with um, four of us actually because um, one of the guy who was with us he died

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.840
Minnesota's in peace. Yeah

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.320
And the group grew till now we've got about 30 40 members

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:47.120
And some of them, you know, we have they're not just about talking about your condition and do fun things as well

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.040
We do craft

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.080
knitting painting we do day trips

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.880
you know fun things as well and

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.360
you know just like um

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.880
50 plus

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:03.440
You know, we all make friends and and all that we look out for each other

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.880
someone don't turn up before what happened to you then

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:15.680
You know and um, I think it's just part of you you just do anyway a couple weeks ago we had a

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.640
um

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.640
Caribbean something

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.240
Was it minrush?

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.520
here

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.520
and I was able to

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:31.440
Cook a whole range of Caribbean food and set it up nice made it a bit more nice

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.760
Roy and all they'll tell you about it. I did that

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.400
So single-handedly, you know

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:43.280
The other girls they did asian stuff. I did cabins. So some other combination

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:48.240
And it really really went down the tree if anything is put age alive on the map

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.160
Because you know, it was well attended and

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.880
It was really the theme was togetherness and it did work

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.520
but everybody, you know

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.080
Was on the same level

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.960
mingling eating, you know happy

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.840
music telling their stories

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.480
And it was so lovely

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:17.680
Do you just decide question do you have any mementos or heirlooms that uh could help explain some of these things you've done

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.280
Fetch graphs

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.680
Yes, we do but I don't have it in my house, um

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:33.520
Oh, i've got um, like some poster um leaflets like with my name and

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.560
That I mean the reason I ask is

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:45.120
The people's collection is a digital collection it allows us to input first graphs and flyers and etc into the the archive

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:51.360
And there would be a chance to place things in there. You just do I think visual story change be powerful

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:56.640
Yeah, I understand what you said. Um, if you've got stuff, would you be able to um

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.200
Donate them to be scanned. They wouldn't be kept. They'd be scanned and you'd have them back

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.920
Would that be possible for yourself?

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
There's a photograph on on there that that that was to do with side

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:17.040
It would be side life i'd have to get from side life because I don't really have much at home that's okay

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.280
um

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.280
I'll move on to

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:28.400
The final question really all the theme of questions is how has a july or the 50 plus network been for you?

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.520
How is it?

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:34.400
Have you enjoyed it what have you enjoyed about it? Well everything has brought me out of myself

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.400
I met new friends and know about culture

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.200
and the samples are

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:46.500
Was well mixed, you know with um caribbean asian

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.600
european

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.360
welsh

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:57.920
You know, we'll even you know build from different backgrounds and all that but it's like um

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:05.700
It's brought us together and educated us about each other as well and better understanding

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.320
Yeah, you know, um

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.400
as well and

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.640
You know, it's just something maybe

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.280
Even 20 years ago probably was I heard of because

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:23.120
Racism is something I don't even know if it really got where I think sometimes people don't know that they are

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:30.720
They say things and and they don't pay attention to what they're saying, um, you know about age alive

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.920
is

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:41.200
Is is brought us to new heights that's all I could say because we're all blending and it's brought us out of ourselves

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.200
We all look out for each other

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.800
perform each other

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.800
we have a

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.880
WhatsApp group and that's how we communicate

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:59.040
A lot of time what he was doing what who's attending what you know, like this meeting there's a lovely, you know

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:05.840
So so I never met you before but I'll meet you now and all that but I I didn't know who this nice was

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.680
You know, um

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.800
Yeah, that's how you know

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:19.040
As I said, some of us is on holiday at the moment if I come september everything will be back to normal

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:28.480
Um great. I mean at this point we've kind of showed shared I think you've shared quite nicely about

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.920
Your journey from Jamaica to living in london

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:36.880
And arriving in here in wales and how faith has been a kind of thread through a lot of this

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.120
um

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:43.760
Is there anything else you would like to leave on record because again, this is the kind of information that can

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:50.400
Last up to 50 to 100 years really if you want to um, so if you know, if you're a great great great

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:54.080
relatives of sorts or friends or someone a friend I mean

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:59.600
About his name called gordon and they found this person. Yeah, because my anything else you'd like to leave

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.920
As I said, my my son is my two welsh girl

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.560
And they've got four children

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.620
My grandchildren they speaks welsh fluently

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.200
You know, um

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.360
So I think that is quite impressive

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.600
because

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.280
even though

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:25.680
Originally, I had no roots in wales. I have now because even if I chose was to go back to london

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.360
Because like my mother and her sisters and all that is still in london

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.000
I'll still have to be coming to wales because

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.800
You know the 20 years i've grounded

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:40.800
You know, i've got my own family here or my children who didn't want to come to wales there in wales now

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.960
So i'm not on my own although I came on my own

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:46.720
originally

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.720
You know my my three boys are here

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.360
They all got big Welsh girls

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:52.880
and

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.520
They have their foundation and they won't go back to london

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.640
You know, so yeah, um

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.440
Wales is my home now

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:08.240
Great any last final message to them maybe uh as when you know little ones grow up

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.680
That you'd want to leave maybe maybe uh

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:16.160
Uh something to live by uh, what's your well well

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.440
My principle is to live your life in truth

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.600
Help, you know be that reach out to people

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.480
Don't judge

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.280
Because sometimes people assume

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.360
and they

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:36.160
Assume wrongly know the person for you judge

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.680
Thank you very much

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:44.400
Last thing that's we're we're we're good there. I mean if there's nothing else i'll stop that's okay. Yeah
