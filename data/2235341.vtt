00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is Emma Delkes from a volunteer with

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Spencer Cardiff Reservoir talking to Phil Savage of Farsomart Digital Memories Project.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It's the 15th of November 2024 and we are at Lisbon District Centre.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So what are your earliest memories of the rental website?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Well when I was young I wasn't even really aware the reservoir was here because it was behind,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
it always had a buffer of fields around it and high hedges and stuff.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So unless you were a fisherman or a sailing person you didn't really come here, you know,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
because there wasn't public access.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So one evening when I was in the sixth form back in 1978 and like that,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I was on my way home from the pub and saw a gap in the hedge and just wandered through it

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and it was night time and then just sat on the edge of this reservoir and I just couldn't believe,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I was literally, I lived in Grouted Avenue and I was coming home through Fitness Park

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and I couldn't believe it was so close to where I lived, you know, 60 acres of water and I hope you missed it.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Yeah, how lovely to get someone across that.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Oh it was a fantastic discovery, it really was, just sat there,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I don't know if you can see it in the visible time in the area, in the seventh form anyway,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
it's only my 11th genki.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
It was just nice to sort of sit in this place and look across this water in the moonlight,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
it was just, you know, kind of thing you just never forget, you know, it was the first impression of a place

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and you just knew it was really special, you know.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So yeah, so that was my first brush through the reservoir, yeah.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So were you, you mentioned fishing and sailing, were you, did you get involved in that?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Yeah, my mother badgered me into sailing, she said you should get up there and make the most of this fabulous facility,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and you know, like a lot of kids, obviously ignored my mother for seven years,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:39.000
that eventually, you know, won't cap and came up here and I did my RYA 1 and 2 up here with Anne Barrett,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Anne and Fran, the two ladies who ran it, and yeah, it was great, we had really good times up there,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000
you know, and it was all run by the council, friends who are very good standard, you know,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and they had a good selection of boats to sail, yeah, they were very good at bringing you on, you know,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and gently introducing you to the various basic concepts behind sailing,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and I think the thing that really captured my imagination was that the principles of sailing,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.000
a little miradingi, or a little tupperdingi, were the same as the great big naval vessels,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.000
they all have to, you know, stay out of irons, you know, if you go directly into the wind you're going to stop,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:44.000
but as long as you're outside the angle, I think it was called irons, it's like 45 degrees either side of the weather,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
winds heading onto you, if you're outside, if you go inside that you stop,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000
but once you're tacking across the wind you're away, and it's just really clever, you know,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
it's age-old stuff, the oldest man, you know, is Dale, and you're learning all these first principles, you know,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
free energies as well. Well yeah, absolutely, yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and I just remember sailing a laser boat, you know, these are sort of racing boats,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and I got in this boat and I was sailing it very cautiously, and Anne Barrett is yelling at me from the boat,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
she said, she said, she wants me to lay flat off the side of the boat, hanging off the side of the boat,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.000
she said, I want to see your head clipping the waves, and this boat just suddenly took off,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000
I mean it sailed in a way, you know, I was being ultra cautious, and she said something pathetic,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
get your head out of there, and suddenly this boat just took off like a motorbike, you know,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
it's like you're turning the throttle on a motorbike, and I shot across the Thantua, I couldn't believe it,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
literally, you know, you have your eyes, literally like just the width from your nose to your ear,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.000
from the waves, and you're skimming across the water, it was such, oh, it was just an amazing,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
exhilarating, it was exhilarating, that's right, exactly, yeah, yeah,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and I thought this is fantastic, and I really, you know, and you come up here with your bag and kit,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and you'd be checking the wind speed and all that, you know, and you thought, oh, today's a good,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000
you know, thing for sailing, you know, and so if you were being sort of particularly confident,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000
there were two sail sizes for a laser, and you'd put the big sail off, you know, even though it was going to

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
throw you in the water quite a bit, if it worked, if it worked right, boy, really travel,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and the thing is, the reservoir, you know, going a diagonal across 68, you know, it's a nice,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
you get a, you know, maybe about two, three minutes of zooming along, you know, before you have to tack

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and turn, and it's really budding, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so that was, yeah, it was good,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and they had a nice clubhouse as well, and it was called the place with, it even had coal hires in it,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
yeah, it was lovely, it was a...

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
This flame you won't blow, okay?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Yeah, don't worry.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
It's your heart wall, you think?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
So what was this clubhouse like?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Well, it was family, it was a, it had a child roof, it was a single storey sort of bungalow sort of thing there,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and it had coal fires in it, it was a real museum piece, you know, sort of built, I think, post-war,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.000
but it was really lovely, and one of the tragedies really of the sort of destruction that Western power

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.000
wrought on the place was they just all those deaths, yeah, and it was a real shame, because I think

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
if it had survived, I think they would have made a bit of a feature of it, you know,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and they'd expanded it with some very bland, terrapin building which we used for changing,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:23.000
but that, you know, it got the job done, and then it has two old sort of virtually earth plasmas in Holland,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
which had to be experienced and be believed, you know, but it all added to the kind of stick of the place,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000
you know, the feeling of it, you know, it was lovely, and obviously the visitor tent in there was fantastic,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
but I think if they had that old sailing tent, it would still exist, I think they could have made something of it,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.000
yeah, you know, it's got a real character, yeah, so, but yeah, there we are, we've come through it.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So what sort of dates was that?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Oh, well that must have been in the early 2000s, the RAD campaign kicked off in 2001,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:17.000
the sailing I think limped on to about 2010, I'm not sure, maybe you can call that, I'm not very good on dates,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000
but then once they, what they did, they lowered the reservoir level very, very low,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
so it made it very difficult to do it in the lurch and boats and stuff,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and when you're low down, you've got windshadow off the walls of the reservoir,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.000
whereas the water's right up, you've got really good wind, sail with, you know, which ever got eddy and all that,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
so they lowered the level, so they were doing anything that was for the sailing, yeah, yeah,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
so that was the end of the thing?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Yeah, yeah, that was it, and they moved all the boats down to Cardiff Bay,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000
but I don't know, I didn't follow it down there,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.000
but the boats were down there, I don't think they really, the sailing got off the ground there,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
because the water wasn't really suitable for immersion sports,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000
I've actually fallen in Cardiff Bay, seen the water and I've had it in my mouth,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000
it's definitely not the same as the lovely fair water they had in Clannocking,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
so...

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Because everything gets flushed out of there.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Yeah, well this is it, you know, yeah, I mean, you know, they did a lot of work on the sewer jobs,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
the forcing stuff, all the impounded things out of the bay,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
but there's still lucky stuff going down there, you know,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
so I think when you're learning stuff, you're going to spend a lot of time with the water,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
you know, if you're stressing yourself,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
so, and you didn't want to, and people would fall in any way,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
they were getting ear and eye infections, you know, and tummy bugs,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
that's why you're attracted, you fall in a sort of placement sewage, you know.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah, you can get the whole shebang going down there, yeah.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Anyway, there we are.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Nothing to compare to here.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So, do you feel like it touches any of the people you've learned to sail with?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, mostly Anne, and you know, the extra structure,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000
she's living in the area, and I did, after we were there,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
when we were trying to work out a bit of the reservoir, you know,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
when it looked like we might be able to beat western power,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
but at that time, world board was on board,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000
so we were trying to work out a business formula for running the reservoir,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
but actually, do your best thing, because they are a water company,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and they know their stuff, you know, and they've got to, you know,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
they're set up for it, to run reservoirs.
