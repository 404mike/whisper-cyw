00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I've always been involved in communal activity, whether it be Jewish or non-Jewish.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I've always been active. So when my son Daniel was born and went to school, I was involved from the first year in the Parents Teachers Association.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And with my links obviously to the warehouse, I could give the school a more advantageous prices and they could buy it normally.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And I became the social chair for quite a while and we used to do summer fates.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I also used to sell fireworks, so I started doing firework displays and I used to do the firework display at the local school.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I was also then involved in the King Coydon Lakeside Festival, which brought the whole community together.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And I worked with local councillors, other parents, volunteers, governors.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And when Daniel left Lakeside, one of the projects we'd undertaken before he left was to convert a disused swimming pool into one of the first after-school clubs in Cardiff.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And we created Dragonflies. And Dragonflies I still think is thriving today.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It's an after-school club that allows parents who are working to drop their children off at school early, maybe from about seven quarters to eight, prior to school.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And then the workers would then pick up the children from school and keep them until five, six o'clock at night when the parents finished work.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And it was an amazing facility ahead of its time. We were very much ahead of its time.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:51.000
We actually got Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson to open it because new regulations had come in where we had to have all facilities to cater for disabled access.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And Tanni had just become a local Paralympian. And she was brought in.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Her family lived in the Heath and she came, she agreed to come and open the centre for us.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And it was a great achievement. And I was still involved with the organisation and the running of that group even after five years after Daniel had left Lakeside and moved on to Cardiff High.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And when he moved on to Cardiff High, I was involved with the Parents Teacher Association there.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And up until this year, I mean Daniel's 34 now, so he left school when he was 18, 16 years later, some of the work that I used to do on a...not even work.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:39.000
It was one of the jobs I used to do as an MC, a Toastmaster. And I did it for friends and family, for events and I did it for the school prom.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So they decided to start a prom I think in about...when Daniel was in about Form 5, so about two years before he actually got up to the top of the school.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And I did the Toastmaster work for that. And then even after he had left, I carried on until last year doing that work on a voluntary basis.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I do it because it gave me the opportunity. I have a principle that if you can give back something from something you've received from, it will help pay back what's been received.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So when Daniel was taking from the school his education and I was able to give back something back to the school, then I was always pleased to do so. So I've always supported that.
