00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is a timeline of the race riots in USA in 1919.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It is not a breakdown of all the events in 1919 in America.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We'll come back to that.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:26.000
That timeline of events, the race riots, it became known as the Red Summer.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So let's just go through those events.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
February to May.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
On the 8th of February, Georgia, Blakely.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
14th of March, Tennessee, Memphis.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
10th of April, West Virginia, Morgan County.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
13th of April, Georgia, Jenkins County.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
10th of May, South Carolina, Charleston.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And then back in Georgia on the 10th of May in Sylvester.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
29th of May, Connecticut, New London.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And then back in Georgia on the 29th of May in Putnam County.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The riots were to continue.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And so was the loss of life, lynching, etc.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We'll be more descriptive about that when we look at individual events.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But in June 19, there was the 13th of June, Tennessee, in Memphis.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
On the 27th of June, Tennessee, in Annapolis.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And then on the 27th of June again, Mississippi, Macon.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Then in July, it was a tragically busy month.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The 5th, Pennsylvania, Scranton.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
On the 6th, back again in Georgia, Dublin.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The 7th, Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
The 8th, Pennsylvania, Coatesville.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
On the 9th, Alabama, Tuscaloosa.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
The 10th, Texas, Longview.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000
A town inhabited by black people that was destroyed and the mayor burnt.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
The 11th of May, July.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Maryland, Baltimore.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The 15th, back in Texas, Port Arthur.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And on the 19th, in the capital, Washington, D.C.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Still in July, the 23rd, Louisiana, New Orleans.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The 23rd again, Pennsylvania, Derby.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
The 26th, back in Alabama, Hobson City.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
On the 27th, eight days, an armed resistance by black people.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Illinois, Chicago.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
The 28th, South Carolina, Newbury.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
The 31st, Illinois, Bloomington, New York.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Syracuse, Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Again.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
August to October, when our list of the events ends.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
6th of August, back in Texas, for Texarkana.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
21st of August, New York.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Once again, armed resistance.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
28th of August, Nebraska, Omaha.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
The 15th of September, South Carolina, Ellerton.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And on the 1st of October, Arkansas, Elaine.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And Maryland, Baltimore.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
If you look at the headlines for that time period,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
the mourning world herald, mob in Omaha,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Lynch's Negro Attempts to Hang Mayor Smith.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Chicago, three dead, 50 hurt in race riots on Chicago Bathing Beach.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
The Rock Island, Argus, in West Illinois.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Omaha has Wild Night under mob.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Negro Burned Mayor Hanged.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
The New Orleans states,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
John Hartfield will be lynched by Ellsville mob

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
at 5 o'clock this afternoon.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
3,000 mob will burn Negro.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
That's in advance of the event.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Lynched by Florida mob, Negro's body riddled with bullets

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.000
found on tree by passes by Lake City, November 29th.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Now the American policy in 1919 hardly was likely

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
to encourage an end to these events.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
President Wilson saw Bolshevism as a mistake

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
that had to be resisted and corrected.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
He had two main priorities in 1919.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
One, to create what we now call the United Nations.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And two, to end the Iraq War.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
He believed the revolution in Russia was worse than anything

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
represented by the Kaiser.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And that the Bolsheviks were, quote,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
a group of men more cruel than the Tsar himself.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
A communist regime meant, according to Wilson,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
government by terror, government by force,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
not government by vote.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Furthermore, it ruled by the poison of disorder,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
the poison of revolt, the poison of the revolution.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
As a result, the poison of revolt, the poison of chaos.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
It was, the president believed, the negation of everything

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
that is American and had to be opposed.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Let's step back to one of those remarks.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
The Bolsheviks were a group of men more cruel

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
than the Tsar himself.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
That's some admission, in case of who you're supporting.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
The Secretary of State, Bainbridge Colby,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
wrote that the US policy was based on the premise

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
that the present rulers of Russia do not rule

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
by the will or the consent of any considerable portion

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
of the Russian people.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
The Bolsheviks had falsely seized power and were using,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
quote, the machinery of government with savage oppression

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
to maintain themselves in power.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Moreover, the, quote, existing regime in Russia

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
is based upon the negation of every principle of honor

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
and good faith and every usage and convention

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
underlying the whole structure of international law.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
It was therefore not possible for the government

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
of the United States to recognize the present rulers of Russia.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And the Americans were involved in the Russian Civil War.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
The North Russia Expeditionary Force,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
also known as the Polar Bear Expedition,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
sent approximately 8,000 personnel from the US Army,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
including the 310th Engineers, the 339th Infantry,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
the 337th Field Hospital, and its ambulance company.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Also the 167th and 168th Railroad Companies,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
which were sent to Mermenst

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
to operate the Mermenst to Petrograd Line.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
The US Navy sent the cruiser USS Olympia

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
during August and September,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000
including 53 personnel who were attached to British units.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Now Woodrow Wilson, the president,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
said much about black people during the time.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
It is important to know where he comes from.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
He was a southern president.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
His family historically were involved in the Civil War

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
on the Confederate side.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
During his first time in office, he passed a law,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
that was in 1912, the law was passed

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
making racial intermarriage a felony

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
in the District of Columbia, Washington.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
His new postmaster general also ordered

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
that his Washington offices be segregated

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
with the Treasury and Navy soon doing the same.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Suddenly photographs were required

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
for all applicants for federal jobs.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And when pressed by Black leaders, Wilson replied,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
the purpose of these measures was to reduce the friction.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
It is as far as possible from being a movement

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
against the Negroes.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
I sincerely believe it to be in their interests.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Now the main organ of control in many people's view

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
was the FBI and the press.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
During the Chicago riots,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
the press learned from the Department of Justice

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
officials that the international workers and Bolsheviks

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
were, quote, spreading propaganda to breed race hatred.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
The FBI reported that leftist views

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
were winning converts in the Black community

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
and that the NAACP was urging color people

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
to incest upon equality with white people

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
and to resort to force if necessary.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000
J. Edgar Hoover, who was a lower grade officer

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
at that time in the FBI,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
analyzed the riots for the attorney general.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
He blamed the July Washington, D.C. riots

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
on numerous assaults committed by Negroes upon white women.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
We, of course, heard this before.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
For the October event in Arkansas,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
he blamed certain local agitation in a Negro lodge.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
A more general cause, he cited,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
was propaganda of a radical nature.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
He charged that socialists were feeding propaganda

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
to Black-owned magazines such as The Messenger,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
which in turn aroused their Black leaders.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
On November 17, the attorney general A. Mitchell Palmer

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
reported to Congress on the threat that anarchists

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and Bolsheviks posed to the government.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Identifying radicalism in the Black community

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
and the open defiance Black leaders advocated

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
in response to racial violence in the summer's rioting.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
It faulted the leadership of the Bolsheviks

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
for an ill-governed reaction towards race-riding.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
In all discussions of recent race riots against Blacks,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
there is reflected the note of pride

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
that a Negro has found himself, that he has fought back,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
that never again will he tamely submit

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
to violence and intimidation.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
It described the dangerous spirit of defiance

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and vengeance of work amongst Negroes.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Now, President Woodrow Wilson was born in Staunton, Virginia,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
and he spent his early years in Augusta, Georgia, Columbia,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
and South Carolina.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
So all across the United States in 1919,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
there was a reign of terror against Black people,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
the result in thousands of injured and dead people.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
The war was a war of the people,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
and the war was a war of the people.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
And as we move forward, we will tell the individual stories

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
of many of those cities and towns

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and the nature of the riots.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
This was the home of another nation

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
that saw the threat of Bolshevism and communism

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
as its major threat going forward.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
However, in America, the president saw Blacks

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
as being likely breeding grounds of the evil of revolution.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Rather than simply riots, victims of the white mob.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
This is Jamie Baker, HDA Cardiff.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Please listen to the following poem.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
If We Must Die is the poem that makes me a poet

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
among colored Americans.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
If we must die, let it not be like hogs

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
hunted and penned in an igloo

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
while round us bark the mad and hungry dogs

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
making their mock at our accursed lot.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
If we must die, oh, let us nobly die

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
so that our precious blood may not be shed in vain.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Then even the monsters we defy

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
shall be constrained to honor us though dead.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Oh, kinsmen, we must meet the common people

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
though far outnumbered, let us show us brave

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and for the thousand blows deal one death blow.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
What though before us lies the open grave?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Like men, we'll face the murderers cowardly pack

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
pressed to the wall, dying but fatally.
