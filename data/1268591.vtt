00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I am queen of the mountains of my own, Of the mountains where in childhood I would roam.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I have welled with southern skies, Where the summer never lies,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But my heart is in the mountains of my own.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I can see the yellow forest gate of the hill, I can hear the magic music of the wind.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:25.000
There is nothing to compare with the love that once was there, In that gloomy little house way up the hill.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I can see a little church far down below, Where the mountain reeds wonder, hope and hope,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And when there my soul shall be, It is there my world to sleep, With those beautiful boys, And lovely waterfalls.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Thanks for watching!
