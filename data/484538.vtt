Cardiff Carnival 25th anniversary project.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.940
Interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.240
Interviewee Holly Jo Smith.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.640
The location is the Swiffer office and the date today is the 17th of October 2015.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.400
Holly, would you be kind enough to spell your name in full for us for the record please?

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.400
I can.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.400
H-O-L-L-Y-J-O-S-M-I-T-H.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.800
That's fantastic, thank you very much.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.560
At what point did you first come across the Cardiff Carnival?

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.200
So my first time I ever did the carnival I was three months old, I was in my mum's arms,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.040
I had a little costume on and I had little bits of face paint on and I was tiny.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.880
I can honestly say that in all the interviews we've done, that's the youngest participant

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.320
that we've recorded so far.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.880
So you get some kind of prize just by starting, you know, it's like, you know, carnival baby.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.760
And it must have only been in its second or third year.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.760
Yeah, very early.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.760
I'm 22 now.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.760
Yep.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.760
Wow, that's extraordinary.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.800
So directly or indirectly, Cardiff Carnival and Swicker have been there either at the

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.800
forefront or the background of your life.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.800
It has.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.800
Since the onset.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.560
That's incredible.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.720
I've got a lot to answer for obviously.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.760
So in terms of obviously your mum, you know, fabulous visual artist, educator and carnival

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.960
artist and you know, she introduced to the world carnival very early.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.440
What's the memories do you have of as a child playing, playing mass, being in carnival here

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.440
in Cardiff?

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.440
I just remember it always seeming to be carnival.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.080
That's just what it was about.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.080
So we started, my mum didn't work for them then.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.080
So we'd just go along and make stuff.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.080
It was, it was pretty constant.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.080
It was, is it some holidays?

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.080
Isn't it?

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.080
Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.080
Yeah.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.680
So we'd go down there quite a lot and just help out with all the things.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.360
And there was always people drumming and there's always like bits of dance workshops going

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.360
on.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.360
I just remember being able to just run around.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.360
Some space.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.360
Freedom.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.360
Just be able to do whatever we wanted.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.160
And it was, there was like the park really close by and we just, it was, it was just

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.160
a lot of freedom just surrounded by really nice people.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.160
Lots of pretty colours.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
Colours are always good.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.160
Do you have any costumes from your childhood that you were particularly fond of or perhaps

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.160
ones you ultimately...

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.160
I remember one I hated.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.160
Did you hate, did you love the Alps back to us?

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.160
Or in fact, are there costumes where you thought like, oh my God.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.160
There's one in particular that I remember.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.160
Excellent, this is a good memory.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.160
I think I was probably in the middle of the night.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.160
I was probably in the middle of the night.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.960
And I didn't know what I was getting when I was going down there.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:55.960
My mum said I was going to be an aeroplane and I thought, oh, could be quite cool.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.080
But I ended up with this big white aeroplane that had bananas on it and it just wasn't

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.080
cool at the time.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.080
No, no, this was, I think it was a fair trade type problem, wasn't it?

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.080
It was, yeah, it was.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.080
And then...

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.080
That was one of the best carnivals, I think, in full.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.080
But I just happened to have a costume I didn't want.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
You didn't crash the plane on purpose or anything, did you?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
No, I think I walked grumpily for a little bit and then got into a way the end of it.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I hear about protests, you know.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Oh God, I can't believe it.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
There were definitely some amazing costumes.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
The one that I probably liked the most, I had like a rainbow skirt, really, really long,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
stripes went vertically.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And it was just like, just swirling it round.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I just loved it.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
That was probably a couple of years before that.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So I was probably only about eight or something.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.920
I can see it in my mind's eye.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.920
You had a fairly large yellow hat on as well.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.920
Yes, yes.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.920
You had pink tops and it was like a candy stripe skirt.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.920
Look, how good am I?

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.920
I can remember.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:53.920
You're very good.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.920
No, no, absolutely.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.920
Because in fact, my daughter, Non, was in that group as well and your mum led it.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.920
And they were bright yellow hats, I think.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.920
Yeah, really yellow.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.920
And really, yeah, I was a great group.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.920
I can remember.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:06.920
Do you know what the makeup was like?

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.920
I think it was white faces.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.840
I think you had white faces with a bit of, yeah.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.840
I don't know.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.840
And I can see you at the end at the oval basin, dancing like dervishes.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.840
I mean, you know, top quality carnival.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.840
That's fantastic.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.840
So, costumes.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.840
So we have your favourite, the candy stripe skirt.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.840
And I'll make sure that we actually get some of those pictures into the

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.840
accompanying documentation.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.760
And then we have also a very important part or a youthful member,

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.760
you still are youthful, of the Carnival crew,

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.760
which went on to sort of break out beyond Carnival and attempt to do

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.760
Carnival theatre.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.760
Can you tell me a bit about that?

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.760
What do you remember about those experiences?

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.760
Dragon in particular.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.760
Yes.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.760
So what was that like for you being in it?

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.760
It was great.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.760
I loved it.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.760
It was like the social part of it as well, wasn't it?

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.760
It was like it was weekly.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.680
It was just people from all different strokes of the world.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.680
Wow.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.680
From Cardiff, I guess.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.680
And just it was just it was just lush.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.680
And I loved the costumes.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.680
And the costumes were really big, weren't they?

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.680
We were always a white dragon.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.680
I'm pretty sure I was always a white dragon.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.680
Because those are the pictures we've got of you online to accompany the interview.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.680
Occasionally, did we do a phase of blue?

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.680
I know we were mostly red and white.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.680
Mostly red and white.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.680
There's some blue dragons in other projects, but.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.680
Because I remember being blue for something.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I tried to think.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Maybe that was something else.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
No, absolutely.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I want to discuss about the Blue Devils.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I know I think I might have done Blue Devils once.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Yes.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
But that was another favourite to watch.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Yeah.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
My mum was amazing.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Yeah.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And Andiola.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I just yeah, that was such a good.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
I loved it.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Yes.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
The red mouth and the blue and the horns.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Blood capsules, the whole shebang.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
It was extraordinary.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
It really was.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.320
So I remember.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.320
So where would you have gone with the Carnival crew on the Dragon Carnival Theatre Tour?

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.320
I know that there's some lovely pictures of you.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.320
You appear to be levitating in one of them, which is quite a clever trick.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.320
You don't mind me saying so.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.320
And that's at a castle.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.320
It's a daytime gig, which is quite interesting.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:26.320
And you're there and your wings and the whole the whole the white dragon tribe is coming out.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.320
Everyone else is walking along and you appear to be about a foot in the air.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.640
It's just like, hang on.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.640
The wings are real.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.640
Absolutely.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.640
It makes you wonder how the hell she doing that?

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.640
But there we are.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.640
The force is strong in this one.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.640
So you obviously did that.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:48.640
I think it's when I think about it, it's is it called a castle or somewhere like that?

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.640
Rings a bell.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.640
Yeah.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.640
But would you have done what other gigs would you have done with the Carnival crew?

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.640
I did it for at least a year.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.640
Excellent.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.640
If not two.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.240
Would you have done one of the early shows down the bay when we were opening for a big

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.240
Spanish thing and we had Wonder Brass performing and the rest of it?

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.240
What was it like?

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.240
It was so busy.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.240
It was, wasn't it?

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.240
There's a lot of people.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.240
It was kind of when I was just coming out of high school, wasn't it?

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.240
So I kept seeing loads of people from my high school and being like, it's me.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.240
They wouldn't recognise you in all the body paint.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.240
Oh my god, it's Holly.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.240
Holly.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.240
Holly who?

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.840
I think that's fantastic.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.840
The whole disguise of it and the rest of it.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.840
Quite incredible.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.840
So Carnival costumes.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.840
Yeah.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.840
And of course, one year you were a trainee as well, which is fantastic.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.840
What was that like as an experience?

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.840
I mean, I loved it.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.840
Yeah, absolutely loved it.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.840
Yeah.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.840
It was just like learning new things.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.840
It was making the big backpacks that I liked the best because you can really make an impact

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.840
with those.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.440
So the costumes are obviously amazing, but it's the big backpacks and working alongside

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.440
people.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.440
Like Kath that year, what did she make?

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.440
Was it a big swan?

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.440
Oh, I could well believe that, which was worn by Thelma.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.440
Yeah.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.440
Beautiful, beautiful swan.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.440
Yes.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.440
It was amazing.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.440
I remember I made like a huge owl backpack and I was very proud of it.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.440
There were definitely images of that going to be on the archives, so I didn't realise

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.440
that you were behind that.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.440
Yeah.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.440
Beautiful, beautiful.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:27.040
So come the day, of course, when you're part of the team, of course, you can't be in full

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.040
costume, can you?

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.040
I mean, we've got pictures of you with...

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.040
That was one of my favourite years I did again.

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:37.040
And you've got your tool belt on and you can see all the animators, all the arts workers,

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:44.200
they're not in full costume and they clearly are ready to staple gun anything that moves

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.200
or stitch something or gaffer taping.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.200
There's a cable tie.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.960
Absolutely.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.960
You look like warriors.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.960
We are carnival warriors.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.960
I remember it was like the day before, I think we were like, what are we going to wear if

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.960
we just had these boiler suits and we just covered them and sprayed them?

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.960
It looks excellent.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.960
This is what we're wearing.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.960
No, no, I think it was great.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.960
It was like you were off the carnival, but you clearly weren't in a full costume, but

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.960
you were there like technicians you looked like on the road.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.960
So like, can we fix it?

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.960
I think that was probably my favourite year I ever did.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.960
Really?

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.960
It was just such a buzz, getting to go up to all the different bands, having a dance

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.720
with everyone, all the different groups.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.720
And because obviously you're working on making the costumes, you get to know a lot of people

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.720
who are in the carnival as well.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.720
So you get to see a lot of the faces.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.720
So to actually see it on the road.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.720
And then the crowd as well and people are asking you questions and I felt very well

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.720
equipped to answer them.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.720
Well, you really are a carnival trans, aren't you?

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.720
You're born up with it around you.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:44.120
That said, there's sad news we discussed earlier, which is due to withdrawal of funding from

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.120
the Arts Council of Wales.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.280
So we're going to have a lot of fun, but it's a bit of a long story.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.280
So I'm just going to go ahead and start by asking you a question.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.280
I'm going to start by asking you a question.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.280
I'm going to start by asking you a question.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.280
What is your, yes, I know, not a quite sad moment in our history.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:05.280
We've managed to stagger through 26 years in various costumes and thousands of people

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.280
have taken part and hundreds of thousands have seen different things over the years.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.280
What?

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.280
Yes.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.280
What's it meant to you?

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.440
What's it meant to you?

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.440
I mean, you really have grown up in it.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.440
It's been part of your life.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.440
It's really sad.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:24.440
It's like, you know, not every year I've been really involved in it or not every year

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.440
I've even gone to see it, but I've always known it's there.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.440
And it is just something that I've always done my whole life and it's not going to be

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.440
there anymore.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.440
It's part of the fabric of Cardiff.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:39.440
So, well, we're not going to finish on a low note.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.600
Before we go any further and to end with, I'd like to award you the fictional and entirely

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.600
non-pecuniary title of Holly.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.600
You are in fact a carnival hero and you'll go down as such.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.600
And thank you very much indeed for sharing your memories with us.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.600
No worries.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.600
Thanks for having me.
