00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.440

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:54.440
Rwy'n oed

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.440
yn y ddwy,

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:09.440
o'r llwyf hŷn, a pha mor. Roedd yn hollol ychydig o'r hollol hŷn a'i gwasanaeth o'i hŷn,

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:14.440
a'i dda iawn yn dda. Roedd yn dda iawn yn dda iawn,

Roeddwn yn cael ei ofio i'r hollol, roeddwn yn ofio i'r hollol,

Roedd y bishops, roedd y bishops ddwy,

ond roedd y bichysedd oedd yno.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:51.440
Roeddwn yn cael y bar, roedd yn cael eu cyhoeddi o'r hotel,

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.440
a un o'r boes catholic yn cael ei gyhoeddi.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.440
A fynd yn oed yn y ddau,

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.440
mae'r hyn a'r hollol,

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.440
maent yn gallu i ni fynd yn ôl i'r hollol,

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.440

Roedd y ffordd ymlaen o'r amser yma o'r cefnod,

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:49.720
A mae llawer a llai o ffrindiau am hyn, rydym yn meddwl, llawer a llai o hyn.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:54.720
How would you describe his character.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.720
How would you describe him?

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:11.720
on the low, the people in the pub. Or like when we were in France and he'd some big fella there and he'd speak a few words of French.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:23.720
But there was immediate gel like, you know, he was one of those characters he could really get to know what they're talking about or whatever they're to say.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:31.720
I know he'd say he never agreed with them, you know, if it was a match, but that was really, Llanelli and Wales came first, like, you know.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:49.720
No, he was a wonderful character in all types of life really. He could do the low bit and he could do the high bit and he was really, there was...

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.720
And always funny, always good fun to be with, you know.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:03.720
Did Father Paul Sartori impact your life in some way and if so, how?

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.720
He took him to a lot of rugby matches, I can show you that.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:31.720
I suppose that, you know, the way we watched him and the way that he talked with every, you know, people and he was so sincere in everything he'd done, whether it be high or low, you know.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:44.720
He was really a brilliant character at doing that and I've never heard anybody kind of say anything about him like, you know, even though he was a priest.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.720
He was naughty, he could be very naughty.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:17:00.720
But then, like, you'd expect, oh, the priest is in the pub. But no, he'd sort more things out in the pub as well as, you know, and I think it's all followed over the years, you know, with all these things.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:10.720
We were together like in the funeral and in this court. We've got loads of photographs at home of different things, you know.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:36.720
But I mean, with him and Joff, like, you know, and Joff is, was a very hard man to think as far as music. Joff was, you know, he would, if he had the band, like, on us, I used to have to go round on the Wednesday night.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:41.720
We had factors for the juniors, like, you know, and then we'd have the rest of the carnival on the Saturday.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:49.720
And Friday night I'd have to go round on the sea, we'd have the whole thing, like, you know. But Joff then would, um.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.720
If there were certain people missing.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.720
The 16 year olds, the 16 year olds, they worked in shops and things like that.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:04.720
And I've gone to his house on Friday night late and said, we got that money, Hannah, and Joff would be.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.720
He'd turn around and say, well, I'm not doing it then.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:21.720
But then Father Paul then with Joff, he had him, he got him right on his fingertips, you know, he couldn't do it. When he was on the low, when he was high, and when he was a high Joff and him, they were really characters to be on, like, you know.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:27.720
If you could sum up Father Paul's story in three words, what would they be?

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:42.720
Human, generous and amusing. More than amusing, you know.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.720
Sincere.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.720
Exactly, yes, yes.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.720
Yes, he would be, you know.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:55.720
And my final question, do you have anything else you'd like to share with us?

00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:01.720
I don't know, it was just, I think.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:13.720
I mean, you know, I'm missing when he got through all that we have there. His, I suppose, when he came to tow the line is when he met his mother.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.720
Yes.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:21.720
You know, and he knew well, when he was going in the door, he would have to obey whatever was said.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:29.720
He'd have to have a shave and he'd have to change his jumper and his clothes and he wouldn't be let out to carry on the thing and that would be.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.720
Oh yes, his mother.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:40.720
All his mother was, she was a lovely person. You know, she was real kind of, you know, all the black Italian thing, you know.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.720
But she stood high, she was really kind of a.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:54.720
She must have frustrated him. He must have frustrated him so many times, I would think, the way he just presented himself mostly, you know.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.720
But no, he had great regard for his mother, I must say.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:06.720
I just think now, like Frank and myself, we sang at his funeral in Llanelli and I've never been so scared of normal life.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:15.720
But the funeral went, we went to the cemetery and there was a big mound of earth on the side and the priests were lowering down.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.720
Well, the one of the priests wasn't very agile like him.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:27.720
He was stepping over and I could say they were leaving the coffin going like that.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.720
I mean, that's somebody.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.720
The frightness to death, yeah.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:38.720
The undertaker or something just was on the end, steady, steady. He stopped the coffin going forward like, you know.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.720
And I thought, oh, you're not going to fall in there now.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.720
But he would have, he would have enjoyed that.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.720
Oh yes, he would.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:48.720
You would have enjoyed that, you know.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.720
He would, yeah.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.720
But, you know, you're asking a lot of things about his life and everything.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:00.720
But the way that we lost him overshadowed so much of that.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.720
It was because we had, we had no control over it.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:14.720
And Father Coffey or Father McGrail it was at his memorial mass not so long ago.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.720
And he tells the story about him going to see him.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:24.720
And he's saying, oh, what are you so miserable about?

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.720
I'm the one that's dying, not you.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.720
So, you know, that's the attitude he put on it.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.720
And there's a letter that he wrote to the parish.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.720
Just while he was ill.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:41.720
To the parishioners.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.720
Yeah, to the parishioners.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:52.720
And just, just, just in, well, embracing all, everybody as part of his family basically, you know.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.720
And very kind things he said about everybody.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:58.720
I mean, he would fall out with people.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.720
There was no two ways about it, you know.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.720
He was opinionated in some ways about things.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:10.720
But even with the church, you know, he would occasionally, he could bend the rules of him, you know, a bit.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:20.720
And if you ever went to confession and say, oh, well, I've done this or I've done that.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.720
And he'd say, have you given to the poor?

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.720
And you'd say, well, no, not really.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.720
Well, here we are then, go and do that.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.720
You know, that was the attitude.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.720
And when he did confessions with the kids for their first communion, you know.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:44.720
And he said to poor old Len, he said, are you the girl that sank the boat off Fishguard Harbour?

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:49.720
Do you remember there was a boat in the harbour, in Fishguard?

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.720
There was one sunk in the middle area.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.720
Yeah. So, you know, that was the attitude.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:01.720
And he gave these kids a lot of confidence because that's an awful, you know, it's a big thing for kids to do that.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:06.720
But no, he just gave them so much confidence and so much, you know, confidence.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.720
You know, just a zest for living, basically.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:16.720
As I say, like his living to 40, but he made the most of that in that time.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:23.720
Yeah, yeah. He said to me once when he lost all his hair, because he was grey like me, you know.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.720
And he said, I'm coming back ginger.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.720
I don't care what you do, but I'm coming back ginger, you know.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.720
And crazy things like that, that he would just come out with, you know.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:45.720
No, he's, as I say, I think the way we lost him coloured the whole thing then afterwards, you know.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.720
So that's, yeah.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.720
He was.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.720
Do you have a favourite story about Father Paul Sartore?

00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:10.720
It's difficult to know which story is our favourite, because as you've heard, we were very much involved with him, both of us at the same time, with the family.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:17.720
And we've got lots of these photographs with the children.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:26.720
I've got one where he's got his veil on his head, one of these veils on his head, you know, that's the sort of thing he did.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:36.720
He interacted a lot with the kids and with the band, of course, you know, because some of these.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.720
I'm just not with us anymore, some of these boys.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:46.720
I don't know if you remember the Burks at all.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.720
He became a priest and it was only last.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.720
Last week.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.720
Last fortnight he died in America.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.720
Yeah, yeah.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:04.720
So, no, it's, and he had a relationship with all these kids.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.720
He knew them all.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.720
He knew their families.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:18.720
They knew him and could go to him at any time, you know, and he was just such a big character that it's hard to pinpoint anything.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.720
The odd ones that we've given you.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.720
He started, he needed funds for the church, he decided.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:35.720
So he hired the drill hall and got Joff and his band to come and play.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:41.720
And then it was he he wanted people to have tables.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.720
I mean, that was not, you know, why they went to a dance and you sat around.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.720
But now he wanted tables and he wanted people to have tables and he wanted all this done.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:56.720
He had great ideas about the way that he wanted people to have tables.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:01.720
He had great ideas about things like social things.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:10.720
And they worked very well, you know, so there was a group of us ladies used to do the refreshments and wash up and all the rest of it.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:19.720
And it was just a parish work together because he put in that amount of work himself.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.720
He just got it going, you know.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.720
The same thing he'd done with the house next door in Dew Street as he'd come out the lane.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:37.720
The parish house, you know, so then he wanted to convert that into a social place then like an after-mast on a Sunday, you know.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.720
I know we put a new floor for us myself and then put a new floor in.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.720
It did last a couple of years, you know.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:52.720
He was like the instigator of saying, oh, we've got people to go and relax and do that sort of thing, you know.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.720
Yeah, he was just an amazing character.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:09.720
And what surprises me now is that if you suggest, you know, you talk to people about the Satori Foundation

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:24.720
and they've no idea who the poster was because the poster that's here now with that 40 years poster is the best poster I've ever seen.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.720
I think that is that photograph.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:35.720
We'd like a poster if we can get a copy of it because that sums him up tremendously.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:40.720
That, you know, casual look but still in his...

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.720
We saw it on the Polis Artorio shop last week.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.720
So we'd love one of those if you can get hold of one.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:53.720
But as I say, it was just...and of course he was our age group as well.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.720
So we could relate to him, you know.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:03.720
And it was...because I mean, I was a convert.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.720
I came into the church as a convert.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.720
But we could talk about anything, you know.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:18.720
I could, you know, tell him about Welsh press Baptists and he would accept that, you know.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:31.720
But then somebody was talking...oh, that was at the other...I think it was a different memorial thing for him.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:40.720
And this chap said he was the nearest thing to the Mafia that he ever knew.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.720
That he ever knew, you know. He was that sort of person.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:49.720
He knew as many rogues as he did your priests, quite honestly.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:51.720
Yeah, yeah.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.720
No, it was just the character he was, just, you know, overall, really.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.720
Do you have anything else you'd like to share with us?

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:08.720
In France, I'll just mess this up, we were sitting at this table inside this glass door, you know.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:14.720
And suddenly this fella was coming through and he hit the glass.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.720
He walked into the glass.

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.720
And of course it was a...oh yes.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.720
And suddenly he picked on Father Paul, you know.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.720
And he was babbling away in French, you know, if Paul did answer.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:32.720
But I thought, I'd pick on him, you know. He walked into the door himself, you know.

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.720
Yeah, yeah. But he hadn't really bothered him.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.720
He was.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.720
But I mean, quite often, he didn't have his collar on anyway.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.720
And when he went to the rugby matches, he had his scarf.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.720
No, he had his big white pullover.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:55.720
Yeah, and he'd hide his collar, if it got a bit too, you know, blue, the language would be too...

00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:00.720
If it got blue, the language, he'd hide his collar then, so he wouldn't be seen.

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.720
But no, he'd...

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.720
Yeah, I don't know how many New Zealanders he killed.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.720
Oh yes, oh yes.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.720
Ffep like he was a grand territory.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:17.720
So we were sweating and after round and round the rooms we were still missing one child.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:23.720
But Father and Rust were sitting there now with their bottle of whiskey waiting now three or four hours too.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.720
They needed petrol waiting for the petrol station to open.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.720
Yeah, the petrol station we were at, and then they were sitting there then.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:37.720
So suddenly this little white face came up over the top and left him behind.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.720
He had to take him in, like, you know.
