00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.000
When I survey the wondrous cross,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:31.000
On which the Prince of Glory died,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:41.000
My riches gained, my comfort lost,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And for contempt alone I cried.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:03.000
For it, Lord, that I should boast,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Save in the cross of Christ my God,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:24.000
All the great things that God bemost,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I sacrifice them to his blood.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:47.000
See from his head his heaven and his feet,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Sorrow and love from mayors of the ground,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:08.000
This at last, and sorrow meet,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:21.000
All the forms come forth so rich at ground.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:33.000
O'er the whole realm of nature whine,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:44.000
That where there are great ones to scold,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Love so amazing, so divine,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Demands my soul, my life, my heart.
