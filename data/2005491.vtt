00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
My name is Chris Harding and I've been going to gigs in Newport since 1989.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.920
The first gig I went to in Newport was the Wonderstuff at Newport Centre.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.320
It would have been December 1989.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.400
So I would have been 16.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.280
We're really excited about going to the gig.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.720
We did the classic thing of going there really early.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.400
We were queuing outside from about 6 o'clock just so we could be down the front.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.800
Nowadays you'd be turning up about 9, having missed the support band and just about catching the band.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.480
So we were first ones in.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.520
I don't think we even went to the bar that night when we were kids.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.920
We saw basically the Wonderstuff at their peak really.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.800
They were amazing.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.400
There was about four of us there and obviously we all got separated in the mosh pit.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.840
It was a great first gig to go to.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.040
And getting there early we managed to catch the support band which was Ned's Tom Mcduspin

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.720
who were amazing and we saw them loads of times when they played Newport because they came back.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.000
And they had two bass players which nobody had at the time.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.920
It was kind of their thing.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.200
I'm not sure it added to the sound at all.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.120
It was just they were just mates I think.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.520
We were all massive fans of the Wonderstuff.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.200
I think Hup the album had come out not that long ago.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.000
They were massive at that time.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I think they had maybe a few top four hits which would write the lower end of the charts.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.240
But we were all really excited to go.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.560
Miles Hunt was a fantastic frontman.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.880
The Wonderstuff at that time they did a few minor hits at the lower end of the top 40.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.080
It was the time before they teamed up with Vic Rees to Dizzy or Sides of a Cow.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.800
They weren't quite unknown.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.880
They weren't megastars.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.360
In fact they never went on to become megastars.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.840
They were kind of a kind of middle-insult level band.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.280
But they always went down really well in Newport.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.440
They played the Newport Centre a few times and the gigs were a real sort of party atmosphere.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.840
Newport Centre was a bit of a mad venue for gigs because when you went in you had the

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.000
swimming pool with the wave machine and stuff.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.040
And often you had people in the pool while the gigs were on.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.560
So you went into the venue itself.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.480
It wasn't that big but it was a sports hall.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.880
But the acoustics were really good and you had plenty of seats there so you had the choice

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.160
of being right down the front in the middle of the mosh pit or as you got older if you

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.800
wanted to go sit in the back and be able to appreciate things a bit more and actually

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.840
watch the band.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.640
I think it was a great venue.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.640
It played host to people like David Bowie played there, The Cure, The Smiths, Stone Roses.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.760
I'd say Newport at that time was more of a lure than Cardiff.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.960
I don't think Cardiff had a venue that could touch Newport Centre.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.600
It was the only second gig I'd ever been to.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.400
A few weeks beforehand I'd been to the Beautiful South in Cardiff.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.160
But I think it was one of the stuff that set my love of guitar bands and sort of alternative music.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.360
Another thing I remember is at the end of it when we left.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.160
Seeing all the guys outside selling the dodgy t-shirts which were half the price of the

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.360
ones that were on sale in the venue.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.160
I remember seeing that the gig would have been advertised in the NME or Melody Maker

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.120
or something like that and then we'd actually physically have to go to the venue to buy

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.120
the tickets.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.080
I think you might actually have had to queue up when they went on sale.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.600
There's none of the days like now where you can just order your tickets online.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.280
You physically have to go and get them.
