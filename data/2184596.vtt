00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.500
My name is Chandrika Joshi and I have come today to a home of a beautiful family and

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:23.000
it's 24th of March 2024 and I've come to interview a wonderful lady.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Hello, my name is Karim Ali Bhai.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We are from Uganda and settled in Cardiff very well.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Thank you Karim Ali Bhai.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You started from Uganda. Were you born in Uganda?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
No, I was born in Nairobi.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
In Nairobi, so in East Africa.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And your husband was born?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
In Uganda.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Oh, he was born in Uganda.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So you were the second generation in Uganda?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Yes.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So your brother and your parents...

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
All of them were from Nairobi.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
All of them were from Nairobi.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So how many generations?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Who was the first person in your family to come to East Africa?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I think it was my great-grandfather.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Your great-grandfather.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So they didn't work in the railway, but in business?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Yes, but they came here during the railway.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
When did the railway start?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
They used to come here during the railway.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
They used to do business.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Business. When the railway started, they used to come here.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And when did you come from India?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I don't know when I came from India, but I know that it's Gujarat.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Oh, okay. You came from Gujarat.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I think if you came at that time, you must have come to the village.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Because you used to come to the village first.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You used to come in a steamer.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So you three were your great-great-grandfathers.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
How interesting.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And in Nairobi... What was your husband's name?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Sadurdin Pawpat Ali Bhai.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Sadurdin Bhai, right.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And Sadurdin Bhai's grandparents are from Gujarat, India.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
His father is from India.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Oh, his father is from India.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Okay, so he later on...

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Later on.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And what was his place of birth?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
He was in Kikandwa.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
In Kikandwa. Okay, in Nanakda, Kikandwa.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So when did you get married?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I came to Uganda from Nairobi.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
How did you feel about coming to Uganda?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Alright, because I was used to it.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
We used to live in Nairobi.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
We used to live outside the town.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
It was similar to Kikandwa.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Kikandwa, yes.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And your husband's father used to do business?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
He used to do business, but he was very good.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Oh, okay, right.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Then everyone moved to Kampala.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Everyone got jobs.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Everyone used to work.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Okay, so his siblings and extended family were all in Kikandwa?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Yes, everyone moved.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Some went to Jindja, some went to Kampala.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Fatima was there.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I got all the proper details.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Who was Fatima?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
You know, she passed away today.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
She was 15 years old.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
No, she was in Delhi.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
She was 12 years old.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
She was 13 or 14 years old.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
She lived in Kadip?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Yes, she lived in Kadip.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
She lived in Kadip.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So did Fatima remember everything?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Everything.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
She could feel everything.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
She could feel everything.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
When she took the medicine, she could feel it.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
She could feel her heart beating.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
She could feel it.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
She would feel it.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
She started feeling it.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:44.000
How long did you stay in Kikandwa?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I stayed in Kikandwa for a year because my husband was not working.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Then we went to Nammingora.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:03.000
We stayed in Kikandwa for a year.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Then we came back to Kampala.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
We came back to Kikandwa.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Kikandwa was settled.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Because we didn't have any business there.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
My husband was working.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
He was working in the village.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
But in Kikandwa, he started his own business.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
It was not a year or two.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
We stayed in Kikandwa.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
You were settled in Kikandwa.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
How long did you stay in Uganda?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
When did you come to Uganda?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
In 1963.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
You were in 1963.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
You came in 1963.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
You stayed in Uganda for 9 years.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
How was your trip to Uganda?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
What did you think of the village?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I liked it a lot.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Because the neighbors were very friendly.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
They were very quiet and peaceful.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
They were very quiet and peaceful.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Did you miss this life?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Did you miss it?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
I miss it a lot.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
We saw all this, but we didn't see the rest.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
That's true.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
What was your favorite?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Did you like everything?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
The forest?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
The forest.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I liked everything.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Life was different here.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Life was different.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
It was winter.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
It was so cold.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I had a cold.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
That's true.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
When you left in 1972, you said...

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
I was 72.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
How many children did you have?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I had 21.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Sheleena was 7.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
I was 8.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
All three children?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Yes.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
When you announced to your mother

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
that you were leaving for three months,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
how was the atmosphere there?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
It was okay for us.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
We didn't have any problems.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
We didn't have any problems.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
In the town,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
we didn't have any problems.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
We were like,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
we'll change our minds tomorrow.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
After a month or two,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
we'll go back.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
We'll go back.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
That's true.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Did you feel lonely in your village?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Yes, a lot.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
A lot.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
When the shop was sold,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I felt very lonely.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
When the shop was stolen,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
did you feel lonely?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Yes.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
When the shop was stolen,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
did you feel lonely?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
How was it?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Sheleena, can you explain?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
When the shop was stolen,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
did you feel lonely?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
I felt lonely.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
When the shop was stolen,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
did you feel lonely?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Yes.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
When the shop was stolen,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
did you feel lonely?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
I didn't feel lonely.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
I was in Kikando,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
in Busunju,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
10-15 miles from Kampala.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
I didn't feel lonely.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
I didn't feel lonely.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
When the shop was stolen,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
my husband was shot down.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
He passed away.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Your husband?

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Yes.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
How was it?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
When the shop was stolen,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
the thieves were brought with guns?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Yes, with guns.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
We had a petrol station.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
We had to get petrol.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
If it was Sunday, we couldn't work,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
so we had to get petrol.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
I went to get petrol and held my hand.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
I asked, why are you holding my hand?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
I didn't have petrol.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I was taken inside.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
My husband was shot down.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
He was shot dead.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
I was shot dead.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
It was natural.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
It was natural.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Your husband's blessings.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Did you tell your son that you wanted him?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Yes.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
I was going to Kampala.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
I was going to Kampala.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
I was going to Kampala.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Did you tell your son that you wanted him?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Yes, I told my mother.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Did you tell your mother?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Yes.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
I was going to Karyani School.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
I was going to Karyani School.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
I was going to Karyani School.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Now people are smarter.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
We have nothing to worry about.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
When did you go back?

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
I went four years ago.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
You didn't go to Uganda?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
My mother, father and everyone else.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Now everyone is gone.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Your parents were in Nairobi?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Yes.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
My sister's three sisters.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
They died in the second week.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
She was pregnant.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Yes.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
She died of cancer.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Yes.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
This is our story.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
This is our life.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Did you sell anything in business?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Yes, we sold everything.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
We sold clothes.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
We sold everything.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
We sold everything.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
You had two children.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
You had two children.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
They were born in Kampala.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
They were born in Kampala.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
In some respect,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
you were the reason for the theft.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
You were the reason for the theft.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Yes.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
We used to send them to Kampala.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
They were born then.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
They were born then.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
How much did you earn?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
We used to work.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
We used to work.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
We used to work.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
What did you do?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
What did you do?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
I was a woman.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I was a woman.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
I was a woman.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
I was a woman.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
I was a woman.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Did you take your children to Kampala?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Yes.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Did you get your visa?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Yes, I got my visa through Aga Khan.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Aga Khan.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
I mean,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
I was just saying that

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Aga Khan, your son,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
was helping in East Africa.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Yes.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
How did you manage to get out of there?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
How did you manage to get out?

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
I was not involved in that.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
You were told to leave before you were even 20 years old.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Yes.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Our village head used to do everything.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
He used to do everything.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
He used to do everything.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
How good was your work?

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Everything was done.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Did your father have a passport?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
My father had a British passport.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
We came here.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
We didn't know where we were from.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
So your husband had a British passport.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Yes.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
It was so difficult.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
I was married for three generations.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
I was married to a woman from India.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Her husband's father was also there.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
But he was born in Uganda.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
So, that was the peace.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Did your extended family have a British passport?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Did your extended family have a British passport?

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Did your extended family have a British passport?

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
All of them had British passports.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
All of them had British passports.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
So, your family had a British passport.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Yes.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
My mother had a family in Nairobi.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
My mother and father lived in the same house.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I had no other family.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
I had no other family.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
The second person talking is Shalina,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
who is the older daughter of Masi.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Masi.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Masi Karima.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Masi Karima Masi.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
What did Shalina say?

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
What did Shalina say?

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
She said that she had no other family in Uganda.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
She only had her aunt and uncle.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
She had no other family.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
We had a check-up at the hospital.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
My aunt and uncle.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Extended family.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
But your relatives were all in Nairobi.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
But your relatives were all in Nairobi.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
But when...

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
But when...

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
When did you leave Uganda?

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
I don't have a date or a month.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I left in October.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
I left in October.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Do you think so?

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
What time did you arrive at the airport?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Stansted.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Then we went to the Toverstok Camp.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
We went to the Toverstok Camp.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
We spent two months here.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
How long did you stay in Cardiff in October?

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Then we went to Cardiff.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
How was your life in the camp?

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Royalty.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Really?

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Your mother spoke English.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
We had an apartment.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
A small one.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
A small room.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
And the toilet and shower were separate.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Really nice.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Did you volunteer in the camp?

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
WRBS.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
You volunteered there.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Yes.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
We had to give clothes.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
We gave information.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
And the people who didn't know the language,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
did you translate?

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
In our camp, we knew a lot of English.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
We were 63.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
We were 63.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
I think the older people were older.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
They were from the Kentucky side.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
How old were you when you came here?

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
How old were you when you came here?

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
When I came from Uganda?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
When you came from Uganda?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
28 years old.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Young woman.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
28 years.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
78.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
You're 78 now.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
I'm 78 now.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
But you're still a beauty.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Don't lie.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
I'm telling the truth.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
You volunteered in the camp.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Did you have enough food to eat?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Yes.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
We usually eat beans, eggs, chips.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
But we didn't have to.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
We ate everything.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Then we went.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
You volunteered.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
We went to the 4th tower.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
We didn't know where to go.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
We didn't know where to go.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
We were interested.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
I was interested.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
When was your first Eid?

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
When you came to this country?

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
When I came here.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
It was very simple.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
We all went to pray.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
There was a time when the community grew.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Then we started celebrating.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Did you decide to go to Cardiff?

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Or did they automatically decide to go to Cardiff?

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
I asked them where they wanted to go.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
There were two places.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Scotland and London.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
I said I didn't want to go anywhere.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
I wanted to go to Scotland.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
I said I didn't want to go anywhere.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
I went to Scotland.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
I told my husband that it was so cold here.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
She wouldn't be able to survive.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
I said come tomorrow morning.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
I'll show you the other house.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
My husband went.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
There was a house in Cardiff.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
It was on Kifata Street.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
This is the one.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
I went to see the other house.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
I was very scared.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
I was afraid that I would die.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
I was scared.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
I was scared.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
I was scared.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
I was scared.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
I was scared.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Did you know anyone?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
I didn't know anyone.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
But our social workers were very nice.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Their team was very nice.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
I told them that this family is coming from Cardiff.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
I told them that this family is coming from Cardiff.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
So they should be careful.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Was there a furniture in the house?

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
There was a table and chair in the furniture.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
There was a pot in the furniture.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
There were no shoes.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
But in the house, we had A-Z approvals.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Oh gosh.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
And we had rations in the house.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
How nice.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
I think someone from India might have helped people.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
I think someone from India might have helped people.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
But we didn't have to go there.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
We didn't have to go there.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Did you go to the Chokhrao School locally?

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
Yes, I went to Mr. Muniram.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Muniram was the head of the school.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Okay.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
I went to Shailinan and Mehmugna.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
I was very young.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
I was in St. Peter's Church.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
I stayed in the school.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Then I went to Howard Union.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
I went to college.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
I met all the two of them.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
You met all the two of them.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Where is your son?

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
He is with me.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
He went to take his daughter.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Where is he going? What is it called?

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Aberystwyth.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Very nice.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
You were quite young when you came here.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
So your majority of life has gone here.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Yes.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
What did you say?

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Did you have any relatives in Cardiff?

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
We did have relatives.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
But we didn't know much about the situation.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
There was a Hindu woman from Uganda.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
There was a Hindu woman from Uganda.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
She said that our two students were living in the house.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
She said that our two students were living in the house.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000
They were living in the room downstairs.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
On Friday, she made syrup for us.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Our Prasad was Sukhri.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Oh, Sukhri.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
They made it for us.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Our son was making it for us on Friday.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Our son was making it for us on Friday.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Then she said that she was teaching us.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
She made it for us.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Then she made it for us.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
When we met them, I felt that it was time for us to go home.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
When we met them, I felt that it was time for us to go home.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000
One of them was a professor.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
One of them was a professor.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
What did you do with Abdul Uncle?

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
I did a PhD.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Abdul Uncle was your local friend?

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Yes, he was my local friend.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
After that, we all went to the students' house.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Nobody knew about the house until then.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Nobody knew about the house until then.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
We stayed at our house.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Oh, your old house?

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Yes, we stayed there for a year.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
But then the government didn't come.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
We went to school and then to school.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
We stayed at the parade.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
We went once a week.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
We stayed there for a month.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
But then the carpet, the bed, the bed,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
the students, they didn't come.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
They didn't come.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
We stayed at the house.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
We stayed at the house.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
We stayed in the flat.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
We changed the flat.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000
In Saraswati?

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Yes.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
So you stayed in the flat where the house was?

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Yes.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Then we moved to the street.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
What was the name of the street?

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Elm Street.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
In the corner.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Old people were in the community center.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
They didn't know anything.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
We took a smiley.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Now we are here.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Oh, on Elm Street?

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Yes.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
2001, 2002.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Before that, we were on Claude Road.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Claude Road.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
How many families are there in Cardiff?

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
One year.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
How many Ismaili families are there in Cardiff?

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Is there a big community?

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Not so much.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
Our Cardiff is registered

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
as 130.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
A small community.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
There are students.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
In Cardiff, there are only 50.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
All the families are here.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Oh, the ones in the outskirts.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Swansi is our newly settled

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
family.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Swansi is our new settled family.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
My name? Chandrika.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Very nice.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Tea, coffee.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Thank you so much.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
So you are settled in our country.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
You don't go to Nairobi for holidays.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Because your family was in Nairobi.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Yes.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
My brother was in Uganda.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
He passed away.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
My brother passed away after that.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
He was 12 years old.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000
And your husband lost his job?

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Yes, he lost his job.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
But why did he lose his job?

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
He was on a strike for two weeks.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
He had connections with Ismaili families.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
He was doing business.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
I didn't know.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000
I was in the community.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
I had to eat 50-60 people.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
I had to come to the community.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
The community was a home for students.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
We had to sit on the stairs.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
We had to wash.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
I thought I should come.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
I was in the sitting room.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
I was in the sitting room.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
How did your father's work go?

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
He could sign everyday.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Then he was sent to the British Steel.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Oh, right.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
So he got the job in British Steel.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000
And he worked in British Steel all his life.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Did he change his job?

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
He changed his job in 1983.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
He opened a shop in Ramni.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
He opened a shop in Ramni in 1983.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
He was given redundancy.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Then he went to Ramni

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000
and took a land-trick major.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
It was a council state.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
It had been six months

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000
and he didn't get much.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
He had to leave before 6 in the morning.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
He was tired.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
He was tired.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
He was in a car accident

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
in winter.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
I didn't go.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
I came to the city road.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
There was a shop

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
in the city road.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000
It was a shop.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000
It was a news agency.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
It was a small news agency.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000
When did you leave?

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
In 2000.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
In 2000.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
2002.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000
2002.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
What did you do?

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
What did you do?

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
I was a

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
girl guide.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
There was a shop in the city road.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
I worked here.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000
I was a full-time worker.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
I came home and washed clothes.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
You washed clothes?

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Yes.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Then I changed and took over the home.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
That was a clinic job.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Then I got a nursing job.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Was that a hard job?

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
It was a hard job.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
I had time with the old people.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
They were hungry.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
I just sat and ate.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
It was a charitable thing.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Yes.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
After a few years,

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000
I found something decent.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Yes.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
There was a post office

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
in the corner of the city road.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
There was a post office.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
I got a job there

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
as a catering.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
As a catering.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
I catered there for a little while.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Then my uncle told me to do a shop.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
So you helped in the shop?

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Yes, full-time.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
You were full-time in the shop.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
If I had my own shop, I could do it full-time.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
I did it full-time.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Including Saturday and Sunday.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
I could do everything on Sunday.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
But if I had my own shop,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
I could do it on Sunday for another two days.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Seven and a half days.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Seven and a half days.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000
Did you get sick?

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Yes, I had a spine operation.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Oh gosh, right, okay.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
I thought about it.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
I thought about getting a super-martial.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Because not only one person could do it.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000
I should go shopping and cook.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000
Because everyone else is in school.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Yes, yes.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
Have you ever been to India?

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
No, I haven't.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
I am very shocked that I haven't been there.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
I have been to Shalina.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
We all want to go.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
Let's go.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
I will take care of you.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Are you originally Indian?

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
No.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000
My father was born in India.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000
He was born in Uganda.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
My father was born in 1935.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Young man, 18.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
My father was born in the 1940s.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
My father was born in Uganda.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
My father was born in Uganda.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
So we were all born in Uganda.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
We were born in India.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
When I was in university, that was my first trip to India.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
India.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
But it's a culture shock for us.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Because it's nothing like Uganda.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000
So I did find it a culture shock.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Let's go.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
So are you happy with your life?

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Or are you feeling sad?

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Are you feeling sad?

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000
I am sad that we have to go somewhere

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
and make a proper history.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Fortaram.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Fortaram.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
And we have to go somewhere

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
and make a proper history.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
And we have to go somewhere

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
and make a proper history.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
And we are sad that

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
we don't know our own language.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
Do you speak Gujarati?

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Okay, that's difficult.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
But

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000
it'll have to be edited

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
and edited out.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
But I think online Ismaili community

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Maa Uganda Ni History is there.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Link is in the description.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
And you can watch it.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Okay.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Go and have coffee.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Go and have coffee.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
This is like so typical of

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000
India.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
It's lovely.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Let her do it first and then we'll have tea.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Because she has work to do.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000
What is the best thing

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
that you feel

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
is the best experience

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
in your life?

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Security.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Security.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Because life wasn't secure in Africa.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000
Security.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Because it was so easy to get anywhere.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
It was so busy.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000
But when we came here

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
it was quiet.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
It was quiet.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000
But it's security.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000
What is the best thing

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
in your life in this country?

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Racism.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Racism.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Racism.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Okay.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000
Do you have experience with racism?

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Yes, a lot.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Okay.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
I was in the hospital for 30-35 years.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
I was crying everyday.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
Oh, your neighbors?

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Yes.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
I can't hear you.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000
So,

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
you had experienced racism earlier on?

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Yes.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000
I went to the hospital because

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
I had to go to the check-up.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000
I was at home.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000
I was at home.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000
I was coming from outside.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000
The door was not open.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
I was sleeping in the letter box.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
I was sleeping.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
She came down and pulled me inside.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
She said, there are 12 cars outside.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000
She apologized

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000
because she was listening to music.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000
Your daughter?

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Yes, because she was sleeping.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000
The door was open and she was listening to music.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
There was no one in the house.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000
I apologized

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000
and said, I'm sorry.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000
That you were listening to music.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
She came down and pulled me inside.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000
She was sleeping on the gate.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000
I still call the police.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
I still call the police.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000
I was afraid what I would do.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
My son was studying in London.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000
My son was studying in London.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000
My daughter was shocked.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000
She didn't know what to do.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000
I went to the shop and told them that I was not well.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000
When I decided, the police came to our house.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000
Who called the police?

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000
The neighbor.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000
She said, my mother died.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000
She said it was a lie?

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Yes, she died.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000
She had cancer and bruised her breast.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000
She had cancer and bruised her breast.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000
I was in jail for two years.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
I was in jail for two years.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000
You were in jail?

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000
Yes.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
She was very shocked.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
She was shocked.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000
She was shocked.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
She was shocked.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
She was shocked.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000
They said that a police officer called the police.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000
How old was he?

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
He was 5 years old.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000
He was a male.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
He was a female.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000
A police officer was called a policeman.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
He was a male.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
He was a policeman.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
He was a male.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.560
But then they said, this can't go on.

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:32.560
So, we went and did it.

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.560
Did they say that they were okay?

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.560
Yes, they were okay.

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:40.560
So, you felt bad because you still had to record everything?

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.560
Yes, it was okay.

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:46.560
But if there was a problem, we would write it down.

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.560
We would write down the names.

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.560
God.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.560
Did you feel that the police didn't give you the information

00:39:55.560 --> 00:40:00.560
because your skin is different in color?

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:03.560
No, no.

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.560
If they gave me the information, I would have been finished.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:09.560
Because they didn't give me anything.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:12.560
They gave me the information.

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.560
They didn't give me anything.

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.560
There is racism.

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.560
Okay.

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:22.560
Then you went to court.

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:25.560
Oh, you went to court and filed a case?

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.560
Yes, I filed a case.

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:31.560
I was sentenced to one year in prison.

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:34.560
Until then, I was in prison.

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:37.560
Okay.

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.560
You were in peace after the case?

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:43.560
Yes, I was in peace.

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.560
We still have problems.

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:49.560
If someone wants to see the case, they can start.

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:52.560
If someone wants to see us, they can start.

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:55.560
We have to do something about our past.

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:58.560
Oh, you have to do repairs.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:01.560
I don't believe that someone will call the police.

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.560
They will harass me.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.560
The police can't do anything because it's a private matter.

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.560
So, we still have problems.

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:13.560
How long have you been in trouble?

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:16.560
Since I came here.

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.560
I was living in the next room.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.560
For 23 years?

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.560
For 23 years.

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:28.560
I came here after I came here.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.560
For 23 years.

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:34.560
Gosh.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.560
When did your husband pass away?

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.560
2011.

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.560
2011?

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.560
On 13th.

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.560
January.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.560
Yes, January.

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.560
2011.

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:58.560
Was it a big loss for you?

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.560
Yes.

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.560
At that time, he was at home.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.560
He was at home.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.560
He had a stroke after he went to the shop.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.560
After your husband went to the shop for a stroke.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.560
Gosh.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:19.560
Did he have a disability after the stroke?

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:22.560
Or did he recover?

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.560
He had a disability.

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:28.560
He couldn't speak or move.

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:31.560
He couldn't use his hands.

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.560
Right side.

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.560
So, right side didn't have a stroke.

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:40.560
So, that must have been quite hard.

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:43.560
It was hard.

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:46.560
But I think it was good it happened at that time.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:49.560
Because there were many facilities.

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:52.560
There were many facilities in the hospital.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:55.560
If you see people coming and going, they would help.

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.560
But then it's all gone.

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:01.560
It's all gone.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:04.560
It's not like there were any facilities.

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.560
Social services.

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:10.560
Social workers.

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:13.560
Who are social workers?

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:16.560
You don't know.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:19.560
So, what did you say at that time?

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:22.560
When your husband had a stroke,

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:25.560
was it according to the condition of the local authority?

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:28.560
It was according to the condition of the local authority.

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.560
That you were getting enough support.

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.560
Now you are a bit elderly.

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.560
So, it's not a very good situation.

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.560
If there was any support, it's not that easy.

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.560
Giving money even, it's not easy.
