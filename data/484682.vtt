00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:44.440
Could you spell your name just for the tape? T-A-T-H-A-N-M-C-S-H-A-N-E. Lovely. So what was

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.880
your involvement in Cardiff Carnival? Well I've been involved with a few carnivals over the years,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.080
starting from when I was quite young, lots of dressing up, things like that. I think most of

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.080
the costumes were made by my mum during that period. I think most of my time spent in the

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.280
workshops etc. was probably running around with the other kids trying to make cause as much trouble

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.120
as possible and then there was a lot of dancing, lots of music and everything. I remember that from

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:19.120
the early days. My most vivid memories probably with the steel pans, you know,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.960
when I was a little bit older, my teenage years, did a couple of years in the steel pans, some of

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.600
them in the pit sing rain which was a lot of fun emptying out the steel pans during halfway through

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.040
or more than once definitely. But that was very enjoyable as well, had a lot of fun doing that,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.160
very into music at the time and it was a nice environment where anyone, you didn't really have

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.520
to be from a musical background but everyone got involved no matter what level or experience you

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:54.960
had. It was a very welcoming environment, especially for a musical one. There's always

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.280
the big costumes that you remember, all the colours and as the years have gone by, the bigger

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.920
the crowd, for me I remember the crowds always being bigger as the years went on. I don't remember

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.520
them so much when I was younger possibly because I was young but I felt like there's always a bigger

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.840
following, especially when it moved to the bay and there was a big deal down in the bay,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.120
there's always a lot of people down there. So yeah, no, they were some of the lasting memories

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.520
in mind from the carnivals. Any particular themes or costumes you particularly remember? One of the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.400
costumes I remember most of all was probably the dark riders. I think it was about the age,

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.200
it was probably about 13, 14 and that was always quite a cool one for me, I thought,

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.440
that's exciting. But equally, I remember my brother and I dressed up in green and white and my brother

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.440
was a sheep and I was a dragon and that was always good for me because he was a sheep and I was a

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.880
dragon so I win basically. So that was a lot of fun. Yeah, they were some of the costumes I

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.120
remember mostly. I don't know about any of the other costumes that much, I remember dressing up

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:14.080
as a monkey when I was young but nothing massively from my themes personally that stick out. Okay,

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.200
any memories about other people who were involved or people you met along the way?

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:26.520
Yeah, I mean what was nice is there was always sort of a consistency, there was always sort of

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.880
the same crowd around, you got to know people every year. There were new people every year but

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.040
there was a couple of stalwarts that you saw no matter what year, they were always there every day

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.840
in the workshop putting countless hours in to making sure it happened and that everyone had

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.760
their costumes and everything how they wanted to be. Also the same about the people that were

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.160
leading the practices, there was a lot of people that were there every year, whether it was dancing,

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.840
whether it was steel pans or anything else.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.480
And in terms of the weather, you talked about the weather, how many times do you think you did it in the rain?

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:18.960
Did I do it in the dry? I mean I think that's probably the question, maybe twice I didn't. I

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.320
think there was a lot of, I think I had a lot of rainy experiences, maybe when I was a bit younger

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.880
I think I do remember too where they were dry. I think the majority were quite wet, some of them

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.360
wetter than others, I'll probably go with on the whole. So overall how would you rate your experience

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.400
of being involved in Cardiff Carnival? Oh I loved every minute of it, you know when I was younger

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.000
there was always experiences with lots of other children from all different backgrounds, everyone

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.040
got together, it was a very nice way to socialise, it was always a good atmosphere, always a good vibe

00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:03.760
there. And then even on the day it was always building up and the excitement was always building

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.560
up and you'd go to the workshop more often and you'd see people were in there from morning till

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.280
night and it was worked up as almost like a mini Christmas in the summer when it was like this is

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.480
the day and then you'd have the build up in the morning, everyone would be a bit nervous, is it

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.840
going to rain, isn't it going to rain, or is it already raining? But no matter what everyone was

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.920
always having a good time, it was always a good laugh, always fun, I've never had any bad

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:41.120
experiences with it, it was always a positive. So how did your involvement end? I went to university.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.640
Fair enough.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.280
Maybe, I don't know, yeah probably that.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.480
Okay thank you very much. Thank you.
