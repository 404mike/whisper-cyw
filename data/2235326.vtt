WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760
So morning, Mandy, I'm Chris and I'm a volunteer here and I understand you're a volunteer too.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.440
Yep, that's right.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:19.200
So perhaps you'd like to tell us, I've got to say that the date is the 15th of November

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.480
and it's 11.30 and it's a beautiful morning.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.320
It's absolutely beautiful and stunning.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.320
It's so lovely to be able to have such a beautiful place to come to and I feel really lucky that

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.400
I literally live around the corner.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.960
I can just walk here to come here to visit and something I've done since I've actually

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.240
lived in Kingcoyd.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:47.680
So that was 1982, moved to Kingcoyd and yeah, so I come up from then.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.560
So what's your first memories of the reservoir?

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.560
Literally walking the dogs.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.400
I had three dogs, I had two Yorkshire Terriers and a Great Dane and used to come up here

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.680
regularly to walk well.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.200
Yeah, you weren't meant to bring your dogs around here, but we did come through the fence

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:10.480
and come up and it was, I suppose in those days you were classed as really quite wild

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.280
because the grass was just long, you didn't have all the paths, it was just, you just

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.360
come up here and walked and you saw a few people fishing and other people walking the

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.680
dogs and people walking.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.160
So it was very completely different to what it is now.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.120
So when you first started, was the reservoir still open to the public?

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.960
Yes, yeah, you could come up here.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.960
The main entrance was obviously here by where the cafe and the buildings are now, but obviously

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.920
because I lived over on the other side, on Kingcoyd's side, it just used to go through

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.520
the parks, through Riespenne Park and then comes literally through the hedges and through

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.260
the fencing and come up there and so come up all year round.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.920
So it was an unofficial hole in the fence, was it?

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.120
An unofficial hole in the fence, yeah, yeah.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.840
And you'd come up, yeah, I worked, I worked in the NHS and sometimes it was really quite

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.880
stressful and then you finish work and literally you'd just come up here and sit.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.480
And I often come up, just sit on the bank, just sit up here in the evening, you know,

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.240
bring the dogs or whatever and just come and sit and think, oh, how lovely it is to be

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.920
able to come out and just relax and have that time out.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.000
Yeah, so it was...

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.080
And were dogs officially allowed on there?

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.000
No, I don't think... no, no, no.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.520
I think occasionally they'd have like a warden coming around, I think they would sort of

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.600
say, no, your dog's up here, but you know, a lot of people did and I think as long as

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.000
they were up ahead.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.040
So when you were coming, there was fishing going on and sailing?

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.160
Yeah, yeah, I've got a friend, because I walked up here recently with her and she used to

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.160
come fly fishing up here and she said, oh, crikey, I'm coming up here fly fishing.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.880
But I didn't.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.080
My brother used to do a lot of fishing, but I don't think he actually came up here and

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.760
fished, but yeah.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.640
So you've been here since and or in your house since 1982.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.360
Yeah.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.120
So you've seen a lot of changes over this site of years.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.120
So can you remember when when it got closed?

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.680
Yes, I can remember the date, but just talking to Richard earlier on, it was 2005 when it

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.320
was closed.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.600
And I have to say, we're quite devastated we couldn't come up here from, as I say,

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.800
times I've come here before, I mean, it's covered in the snow, the kids come up with

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.680
their sledges and they'd be going down on the slopes.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.000
And it was lovely.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.320
And one of the biggest memories I have really is coming up here as my son got his GCSE

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.480
results at the Cardiff High and he wouldn't open the envelope.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.560
And he was so worried about opening the envelope that we literally came up here.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.560
I said, I know where we go.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.960
We're going to set the reservoir.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
We sat on the bank.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.800
I said, whatever the results are, it doesn't matter.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.640
I says, we're just sit there and open them up there.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:58.200
So we literally came up, sat on the, you know, on the on the line of reservoir and opened

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.520
his results on the end.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.160
They were very good. All very good.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.680
Yeah. He stayed on to the A levels and yeah, yeah.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.480
But that was a real lasting memory of sitting sitting up here, opening, opening the in those

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.760
days, the brown envelope with all the results.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.600
Lovely.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.960
Yeah.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.400
Yeah.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.680
So did once it was closed, was there any way of getting into the site itself?

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.000
No, because they, they barred it or they put all the, it was like a wire net in it.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.600
First of all, I can remember the first people that took it over.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.040
It was all wired and just closed off.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.800
And then they, then they started draining the, the Lanish and reservoir, which.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.360
So you remember seeing it empty?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.440
Yeah.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.480
Did see it empty?

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.240
Did, where did we come through?

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.280
We did actually come up here when it was empty.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.200
I can't remember how we got in, but we did get in.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.800
So I know I come up here with my son, he's older than and again, was probably wasn't

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.440
official, but I think we actually came in, probably walked through the fields because

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.320
there's a lot of walking up.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.960
You can go up to Liz Vane, can't you walk all through the fields and so on.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.760
And probably got in through somewhere and come in because he did say that point, I

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.480
think he had a drone.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:17.280
He said, I really must bring my drone up here and photograph it empty and film it

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.560
empty.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.560
I don't think we actually did, but yeah, it did come in a few times, but it was, it

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.800
was awful to see it empty.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.320
It was, it was very, very sad and the worry that they were going to build on it.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.080
So yeah, I did get involved with RAG.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.600
I say I was working at the time, so I probably didn't have loads and loads of

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.240
time, but obviously was involved with the newsletter, subscribed and sort of put

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.320
money in into all the guys that were really working hard to save it and did some of

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.560
the sponsored walks.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.840
Yeah.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.280
Did you get involved in the deliveries as well for the leaflets?

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.240
No, I didn't get in that, but I had stickers in my house, stickers on the car and

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.920
then we did the walks and stuff.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.520
So yeah, so involved in that and yeah, I can't believe how long it took really to

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.480
get it all stopped.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.000
But it was good.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.720
It was stopped.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.960
Yeah.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.200
How many you can't deny that.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.040
But you played a part and you must have some quite strong emotions really about

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.040
the fact that where we are today is just, it's completely different.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.880
I love it now, but I have to say when I first saw the plans and they wanted to

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.800
put a building on here and all the rest of it, when I saw it, I wasn't keen

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.760
because I just remember it being so wild and so just, and I thought, I don't need

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.640
another Rothes Park.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.280
We've got Rothes Park.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:47.400
We've got all those facilities and I'm thinking, do we want that?

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.800
And that was something I really didn't feel we needed.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.280
I know lots of people would, but I didn't personally, I liked the idea of it being

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.720
much, much more sort of like wild and just free to just come and walk around.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.000
But I have to say now the way it's been done, I think it's great.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.320
You know, I love dogs.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.400
We've got family dogs.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.240
I am actually glad that you can't have a dog up here.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:10.640
Yeah.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.840
And I'm glad that it's restricted.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.640
There's no bikes and you know, and all the rest of it.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.120
So if you do come up here, it's much more, it's much more relaxed and calm to come

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.360
up here and we love the water.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.000
We've been on the water.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.280
We've been on the, on the big motherboards, the family, and we've

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.200
absolutely had absolutely way a lot of time out there.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.760
And just swimming up here with my sons.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.200
You've been in the water as well.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.080
You've been in the water of Utah.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.800
Oh yeah, it's definitely in the water.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.800
So yeah, so that part of it absolutely loved now.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.200
Yeah.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.480
And yeah, so obviously got involved in becoming a volunteer now that I'm retired

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:57.280
and yeah, come up here a lot just for a walk and hope to do some more volunteering

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.320
going forward, you know, different things.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:07:59.960
Yeah.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.240
Thank you very much.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.360
I think we'll stop it there.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:02.520
Yeah.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:02.840
Okay.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.120
Yeah.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.440
Fine.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:03.760
Lovely.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.440
Thank you.
