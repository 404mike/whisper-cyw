In the footsteps of the rioters, Tonopandi.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This walk follows the footsteps of local miners who rioted here in 1910.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
You will hear why the riot happened and discover the effects on Tonopandi and its inhabitants at the time.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The riots that occurred were the result of a power struggle between miners and the colliery owners,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
with Tonopandi a prime location for the ongoing conflicts in the wealth of coal fields at the start of the 20th century.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The walk begins at the miners' family statue located next to Tonopandi Asda.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
This is at the end of the walk, however, and there are charges for parking.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The walk covers a distance of about half a mile and should take you around 20 minutes to complete.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
take the first right to the Winnipeg Road and turn left.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You will see the miners' statue in a grass square on your left.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Finally, some short history.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
In the hamlets of Tonopandi, a farmer discovered coal that he collected for himself but could not mine efficiently on a larger scale.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:39.000
A mine was developed and later a Scottish entrepreneur developed the mine and later sold the coal, a by-product of mining industry.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
A brickwork was also developed using the clay dug from the mine and employing the women and children.
