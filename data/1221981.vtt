00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
I would like to say something about sport

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.240
and my experience of Jewish life.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.120
I mentioned that I didn't go to synagogue in Edinburgh

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.280
when I was a student,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.800
but I played football, cricket, and tennis

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.440
for Edinburgh Maccabi.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.080
So I had an entree into the Jewish community.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.820
I also used to go to the cultural group,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.820
the Jewish Literary and Philosophical Society in Edinburgh.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.740
In fact, I gave a lecture on Reverend Fine there

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.180
when I first came.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.100
So sport, not just there, but in Israel.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.180
I taught tennis in Ashdod

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.140
to some of the most powerful shop stewards there.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.780
There was no tennis in Israel.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.980
Well, there was.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.220
There was a very middle-class sport

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.360
of what they called Anglo-Saxons.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.960
It was expensive and private clubs.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.680
Later, and in Ashdod, they set up a

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.160
local authority-sponsored club, but that was later.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.240
And I played tennis with them.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.120
I played cricket with Indian Jewish immigrants in Ashdod

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.520
who were port workers.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.760
Here in Swansea, well, there wasn't.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.480
In my time, there used to be, in Cyril's time,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.320
there was table tennis was quite big,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.880
but it wasn't when I was here.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.840
But I used to play tennis with the late Mike Sugarman

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.880
in WIZO tournaments, and we won the Welsh

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.400
and Midlands champion doubles sometime in the 90s.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.040
So I got through in the village playing tennis.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.920
I was playing football with the kids

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.760
and introducing football because they didn't have it.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.000
This gave me an entree to the younger generation

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.480
and the older generation,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.320
I could establish contact easily enough.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.440
And we were young married,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.680
so we had links with young married.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.680
But sport has been a big feature in my social life

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.080
and indeed in my professional life.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.880
And I still play tennis even now.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.840
Of course, I'm given up playing football and cricket

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.360
and athletics.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.160
So, and yeah.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.840
I mean, I'm a member of the Swansea Tennis Club

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.560
and I'm a member of the University Tennis Club.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.480
So it's a way of getting outside

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.160
of the simply Jewish community here in Swansea.
