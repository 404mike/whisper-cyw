00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.600
I only found out probably less than a year ago. It's normally referred to in the

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.120
National Fruit Collection is called Channel Beauty. I don't know much about it.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.360
I'm pretty sure it's in the National Fruit Collection and you can buy wood

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.760
off them. I think it was bred by someone and they have his date about the

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.720
1920s I think but you could easily find that out. It's a Cox seedling I believe.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.520
That's really that's all I know. Channel Beauty. That probably becomes let's say

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.680
the official name but a lot of varieties have lots of pseudonyms,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.800
different names. Some of them will have a hundred different names. When and where

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.320
is it called? Gower? I don't know. I know what it looks like. The tree that I grow,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:07.920
these ones are quite small. Pale yellow, long stalk. It's striped and splashed

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.280
with red splash. This means you're doing that with the Bainbrush.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:22.520
It's sort of crisp, juicy, obvious and it's got sort of an aromatic taste like Cox does.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:31.800
Quite a brisk, clean flavour and I think it was bred by whoever it was as a Cox seedling

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.360
or it might have been a Cox pit plant. I can't remember but all that stuff is easy to find.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:47.880
In fact on the label of my label for Channel Beauty there's a picture of Mumbles pear with

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.720
I think a Swansea Beauty stood outside. I was hoping for one in the bikini or something

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.760
but I can't remember now whether I've got one in the end. Sort of thing you'll get outside of

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.960
pier so I went and spent a lot of time on Google Images. The other half of the label is the National

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:14.840
Fruit Collection picture which is a standard thing. Six views of the apple which will be

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:24.040
the apple with stalk cut in half up and down, cut in half on the equator. A view from the top,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.240
a view from the bottom. For a full description, taste and seasonality, flowering times, it's all

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:38.760
on the national records. It's in the National Fruit Collection and will stay there presumably forever.
