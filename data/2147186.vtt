WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
So first things first, can you tell me what are your names, you already have said, where

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.960
you were born but then where your parents were also then born? And if you start there,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.600
so your names, where you were born and then actually where were your parents born?

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:26.240
Well, we're sisters. My name's Naheed Ashraf. I'm Asra Syed. We were both born in a hospital

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.240
called Lydia Bainan by the Celtic manner, which doesn't exist anymore. So born in a

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:44.040
court. Our parents were from the original India, which then partitioned in 1947. And

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.240
we are from Pakistan, so there was a lot of movement around where mum and dad were actually

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:58.040
Dad was originally from a place called Jumshir and then moved to Bihari and then mum was

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.640
from a place called Jherawala near Feslabad in Pakistan.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.440
What do you know of these areas your parents were born?

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:18.640
I visited quite a few times and had a look at the land that we used to own and where

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.640
my father used to work on the land. We have a family, our extended family is out there,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.240
our uncles and cousins and have been out there a number of times on both sides of the family,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.540
my father's side and my mother's side.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.040
So when people came from India during the, after the partition, most of them, majority,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.240
99% settled as landowners. So everyone owned a piece of land and they had to fend for themselves

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.440
from that land and that's how it worked. So mum and dad weren't related as such,

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.540
they sort of only through marriage they became related. They weren't sort of cousins or

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:04.540
anything like that that you sometimes find. So yeah, my nanny and my nanna and everybody

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.640
they've all sort of brought up. Their mum came from a very, very large family. They

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.640
were nine brothers and sisters and they all came over, they were very lucky actually as

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.440
they came over as a family and that included my dad's family as well where during the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:29.440
partition a lot of people lost a lot of family members due to what happened but they were

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.440
the lucky ones.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.440
With the partition our mum tells us that a lot of people of the family, the elderly,

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.440
died on the way as they were partitioning into Pakistan and are buried somewhere in

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.240
Pakistan but their graves were never marked so we will never know en route from India

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.240
to Pakistan where our ancestors are buried en route when they were making their way into

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:04.240
Pakistan which is really sad. But we know that the land that they had in Pakistan they

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.840
grew corn, sugarcane and wheat and then they grew vegetables and the vegetables were used

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.840
then for cooking for food for the family.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.840
Do you know about the social life back there? What games they played, what activities culturally?

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.840
Do you have any details on that?

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.840
Well I think with dad it was mainly being thrown into work from a very, very young age

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.840
and I think that happened with a lot of the men. Women on the other hand used to make

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.840
up their own games. Mum tells us quite often as a little girl when they were very young

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.840
her and her friends would get together and they would make dolls and get them married

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.840
but they would actually carry out the whole wedding ceremony, make rice and make all the

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.840
food and they would actually have a wedding for the two dolls and those sort of things

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.840
or play Ludo. Ludo was a very popular game then so it wasn't like sort of, there were

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.840
no phones or nothing then or you know Xbox or anything like that so it was you had to

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.840
make up things yourself. So yeah and we found that a lot of the men went to school but a

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.840
lot of the girls didn't go to school. They went to Islamic classes to learn the Quran

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.840
but they didn't all get taught in schools which was quite sad not as it is now.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.840
Let's explore that then a little bit. So that's my next question about schooling.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.840
Do you know what kind of education they had?

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:41.840
The education system is very different to what we have here. So it was more like if

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.840
you got to a certain level in school, so they had one, two, three, four, five, if you got

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.840
to sort of like the fifth Jama'at, that was amazing, you know, you could go on to do big

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.840
things. So you know as long as you sort of got the basics of everything, that was, you

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.840
know, you were good to go. But it was, you can imagine coming over from another country

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.840
settling somewhere else, teachers had to be found, schools had to be set up, it was a

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.840
big thing.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.840
They had no belongings because when they came from, when it partitions because there were

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:24.840
riots between both religions at that time, that they described, my mum describes her

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.840
siblings being thrown into the water with a view of them rescuing them from the water

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.840
to reunite. And then they came with basically what they were wearing, you know, they had

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:43.840
no belongings. So their main focus was to find land, farm, look after the family and

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.840
find a way to survive, to eat.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.840
Yeah, but they also, I remember mum and dad telling me that because they had sisters,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.840
mum had sisters, you know, and because they were girls, they would travel through the

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.840
night rather than the day so they wouldn't get kidnapped and raped and stuff like that.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.840
So they had to travel through the night, sort of like, you know, through the grasslands

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.840
and everything, very, very quietly. And that's how they came across, otherwise they would

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.840
be captured and, you know, killed and things. And that happened to many, many families.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.840
I mean, let's bring that back to yourself then. What was life like for you growing up

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:30.840
here in Newport and your schooling? You talked about your parents, that is not what you're

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.840
old.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.840
Yeah, we were the first generation, yeah, first generation Muslims to start schooling.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.840
So I remember right from the primary age, I think there was only one other person in

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:51.840
the class that was of any colour. And you were very alien to people and I think teachers

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:59.840
had quite low expectations of you. Even though you were born in this country, you spoke English,

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:10.840
many without an accent, you were still seen as somehow inferior. I always felt that it's

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:16.840
almost like your colour disqualified you from being British.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:22.840
Yeah, you had to work really hard to get accepted and even then you weren't really accepted.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:30.840
So through school I didn't really experience any racism as such, but you still get the

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.840
comments, the odd comments and, you know...

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.840
People would say racist slurred and saying, but not you.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.840
But not you, yeah.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.840
Because you're not like that, because they would be in the gang of friends that you had

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.840
made. But they would still then say it to other people, it's not like you, that you're

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.840
different. Well, no, I'm not. I'm the same. They'd question you about your food as well,

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.840
wouldn't they?

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.840
Yeah, definitely all the time.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:08:01.840
What do you eat and the way you dress? It was a struggle and I think, you know, very

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.840
much like when parents came over, they didn't have the welcome that was promised. It wasn't

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:15.840
the land of milk and honey that was promised to them. And I think that it's not far

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.840
from that today when you look at education opportunities, when you look at how far people

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:29.840
have come. It's almost like you have to be, you have to act white to be able to progress.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:36.840
And that was exactly what they had to do to try and integrate into the community. And

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.840
it's been very challenging, I would say.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.840
Yeah, it's been challenging, yeah.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.840
What family traditions or celebrations do you remember from a young age that your parents

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:53.840
kind of did with you, by you and for you? And so how, I mean, when did they arrive

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.840
in the UK as well?

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.840
So, you know, Mum arrived in the 19...

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.840
We've got a whole section on that, but we can just get context.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:07.840
Yeah, so Mum came over around 1967. Her dad came and told us.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:13.840
Dad was here for five years, so he came in the 60s when they were asking for the labour

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:19.840
force to come over here. And then Mum arrived, then he went back to Pakistan after five years

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.840
and then married my Mum. And then they came over here.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.840
And how long until you guys were born?

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:27.840
I was born the year after.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:34.840
Okay, that's a good time to start then. Back to that question, when they arrived, you guys

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:40.840
started to appear. What traditions start do you remember from a very young age then? And

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.840
cultural practices that were instilled upon you and around you?

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.840
Yeah.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.840
More as you remember?

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.840
Well, obviously the obvious ones like Eid and everything. Well, that was a big thing.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:57.840
Massive family get-togethers, because by then my uncles and aunts had arrived. My uncles

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:03.840
had got married and, you know, so they were older than Mum, so they had already started

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.840
their families. So they were slightly older than us. I think between our cousins, there's

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:14.840
about ten years before we started to be a ring. But they settled in Scotland, not here,

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.840
so we didn't see them very often. It wasn't until they came over a few years later than

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:24.840
Serpentine Cardiff, which is when we started big family gatherings. But it was mainly sort

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.840
of the Muslim sort of traditions, I would say.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:33.840
Yeah, so obviously we'd been brought up in a culture where we were toying with two cultures.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.840
So when we were in school, we'd remember coming home and saying, it's Christmas in

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:44.840
school, and then having to say to, you know, parents sort of trying to explain that that

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:51.840
festival was a Christian festival and what have you. But Dad was really keen for us to

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.840
mix with different cultures and different religions and learn about each other. He really,

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:02.840
really wanted to integrate into Britain. And Eid was lovely, especially, you know, the

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:08.840
Ramadan was lovely, you know, the abundance of food, you know, we didn't really understand

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:14.840
it. You know, trying to fit into this society. My mum used to make us keep half a fast. She

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.840
used to say we could eat at 12 o'clock. And so we used to keep a fast and then wake up

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.840
and then eat at 12 o'clock and then think that we did something really amazing. It's

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:28.840
only until we grew up we realised that Mum was trying to sort of keep our religion intact

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:35.840
and keep our cultures intact. And every weekend we had people in our house. Our house was

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:42.840
always full of people. So our parents progressed, you know, after working really hard, we ended

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:49.840
up having businesses. And when we had businesses, our networks became even more bigger and bigger.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:54.840
And all I can remember is our house being full of people, us being in the kitchen just

00:11:54.840 --> 00:12:01.840
making teas and samosas. But it was lovely. Everybody had time for one another.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:07.840
But I do remember though, because we had a lot of English families in our streets, at

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:14.840
Christmas, Mum and Dad would make a sort of like, give them presents, maybe just chocolates

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:19.840
or something. They would always make an effort to go and give their families a gift at Christmas,

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.840
even though it wasn't anything to do with us. So we felt sort of all together because

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:29.840
we had lovely neighbours in that street and they were very, very helpful. They weren't

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.840
sort of, you know, if Mum and Dad weren't home they would say, you know, come to our

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.840
house after school, have some tea and then we'll drop you back off and things like that.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:42.840
They were very, very sort of, it was a lovely little community we lived in. It was really

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.840
nice in those days. But it wasn't always like that. So when we were very, very little

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:52.840
we had some neighbours who were very racist and they would throw things into our garden.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:13:01.840
They would put the music on really loud. And, you know, Mum and Dad kind of felt like if

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:07.840
they'd said something then it would only be worse. So they tolerated it for a while.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.840
And then after a while then whatever they threw over was being thrown back. Eventually,

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:20.840
luckily for us they moved and a good family moved in. But Dad was always protective of

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:26.840
us as well. I mean those social occasions we would always drive up to Rochdale where

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:33.840
we had family and spend, you know, holidays would be there. They wouldn't be holidays

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:39.840
abroad or they would be going to Pakistan. We wouldn't have the holidays abroad as such

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:47.840
as we do now. But it did make you think back when Dad started working here on the railways

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.840
when he first came after he, when he was working in the factories first he went on to work

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:58.840
in the railways and they gave him an English name. Yeah. And that always has stuck in my

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:04.840
mind. Like he has a name which you can say quite perfectly why. Or you could have shortened

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.840
his name. You could have shortened his name. So his name was Ashraf, Mohammed Ashraf and

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:13.840
they gave him an English name on the railways as Sam. So he was always known as Sam. Everyone

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.840
knew him as Sam and that's what they called him. And I always quite often thought like

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.840
why, why did they have the need to do that? And I would, you know, quite often I'd always

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.840
thought even now it really bothers me. I always think I want to go back to all the people

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:35.840
who were working with him and ask them, you know, why, why did you do that? But in our

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:42.840
generation, I know people even in our generation today that have English names at work because

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:48.840
they're trying to fit in. What would, do you know what was the reasoning for them to

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:53.840
arrive when you came? What was the motivations and reasoning? It came for work. It came to

00:14:53.840 --> 00:15:00.840
help rebuild Britain. They came because, well my dad used to say, obviously I'm here

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:11.840
because they were there, but one day they will tell us to go back. Yeah, he did always

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.840
use to say that. And he always used to say we have to build something there. One day

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:18.840
they will always tell us to go back because, you know, they just want us to do the work

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.840
that the white people don't want to do. So he came to help rebuild Britain after the

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.840
war. Yeah, they suffered quite a lot with us growing up and the fact that, you know,

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:33.840
most, half of, more than half of their earnings were sent back to help with the families back

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.840
there so they could build something there. So there was always something there to go

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:42.840
back to. And I think that was, we don't think like that now, but in that generation I think

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:47.840
most parents did that, built something back home in the fear that they might say, well,

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:53.840
you know, you can go now. You know, because of what they experienced in India, I think

00:15:53.840 --> 00:16:00.840
it was always there that that might happen again. So when dad was earning, mum had to

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.840
cope with, you know, those shillings that my dad was bringing home. Part of that had

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:12.840
to be put away so they could send back. And so even mum started work then. So she started

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:17.840
working from home as a lot of the women did, where you're used to sew clothes at home.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:22.840
So there'd be factories like for dresses or hospital wear or whatever. And they would

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:27.840
come and give you a bundle as they called them then. And it depended on you how many

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.840
bundles you wanted that week. You'd sew them, maybe put in zips and buttons and whatever

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.840
on them. And then they would pay you, pay mum for that. And that happened a lot with

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:39.840
all the, just so they were earning something to help, you know, help bring the children

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.840
up and help with bills and things. I remember it being quite...

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:50.840
But dad was earning £12 a week, you know. And they were renting a room when they first

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.840
came here. And then mum wanted to have her own house. So they saved and saved and saved

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:02.840
and then bought a house. So it was £1,100 that they paid for the first house. But in

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:08.840
those days, the community would get together. So if you were going to buy a house, all the

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:14.840
community would put their savings into your deposit to get the house and help you get

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.840
on their housing ladder. And then when it came to their turn, you would do the same

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.840
for them. And that's how it worked. And that's why a lot of the families ended up with homes,

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.840
not just renting. And that's how it worked then.

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.840
So...

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:32.840
What do you know about the work situation? You said where he worked, where your father

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:36.840
and your mother worked, you can briefly explain that. What do you know about those working

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.840
situations and do you have any stories to tell them that?

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:46.840
Well, dad was quite lucky because he got to grips with the language quite quickly. And

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:51.840
because of that, he made a few friends along the way. And because he just got on with things,

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.840
although my dad was quite vocal, he still just got on with things. To him it was a job.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:02.840
He was earning money to provide for his family. He sort of got promoted quite quickly.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:07.840
Yeah, so he was with the railway industry and it was the shunt in the coal. So it was

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:13.840
basically the coal, the trunks that came along with the coal in them, making sure that they

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.840
were going to the right place. We didn't have to go into the coal mines because he was part

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:22.840
of the railways. And that was in Barry, Barryport there. That's how it started. That's where

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:29.840
he used to work. So when an opening came in Newport, they offered it to my dad, which

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:34.840
was great, with a pay rise. So it sort of fell into place.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.840
They were long hours.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.840
Oh yeah, very long hours.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:43.840
Really long hours. And do you remember, dad used to say, when he first came here, before

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:50.840
he married mum, there were lots of Pakistani men living in the same room even. And they

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.840
used to take it in turns to cook. And it's almost like, because they worked shifts, there

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.840
was never a bed empty. So the ones who would go in the daytime would give the night men

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.840
the bed. And the bed was never empty because they would just kind of swap.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:12.840
And food was very scarce as well. So one of them would have to make the flour for the

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:17.840
roti. The other one would make the curry. And they didn't have fridges in those days,

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.840
so they had to cover it up and hide it somewhere cool. And then it was portioned for each

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.840
of them. So whoever came home took their portion and that was it. That's all you had for the

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:31.840
day. You know, it was very, very tough times. They were really tough times. I remember dad

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:36.840
saying, and sometimes you would go sort of hungry, you know. But yeah, like you said,

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.840
they used to have to share beds. So one would do a day shift, one would do a night, and

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.840
they would swap with each other. And that's how they made it work. So until my granddad

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.840
said, you need to come home and get married, you need a wife.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:56.840
But then when they saved their money, he ended up buying, we ended up owning, going

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:03.840
into the rag trade. So it was fashion in Kingsway Centre. And it was in the 80s and business

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:11.840
was thriving. We had a really, really good business. It made mum then gave up work of

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:17.840
what she was doing. All the efforts were put into the shop. And in those days, the whole

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.840
family would be there. So children used to even go into the shops then to be part of,

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:26.840
you don't see that these days, but be part of the people that serve the weekends on a

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:36.840
Saturday or after school. And life changed when dad had his own business. Because that

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:40.840
was what was going to make him enough money to be able to support his family here and

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:46.840
to support the family there in a good way.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.840
I mean during those times, what did they speak of back home? What was their connection

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:56.840
back home and how often did they go back and do they make any efforts to sound like they

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.840
were at that point focusing a lot of energies here?

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:06.840
Well the form of communication was telegrams first. So that's how they communicated. You'd

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:12.840
send something and it wouldn't get there until about six to eight weeks later. And

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:17.840
the same from them. Unless somebody was travelling, then they would give them a letter and say

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.840
can you give this to my son or my daughter? And you were from the same village. But if

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:27.840
not, then that's how they communicated through telegram. There was quite often somebody had

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.840
been born or somebody had passed away and you wouldn't find out until about two months

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:38.840
later because of the telegram. So that was very, very hard. And I know my dad really

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.840
missed his mum and dad.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:46.840
That's the first time I ever saw dad cry is when we had the telegram that his mum had

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.840
died. The first and probably last time that I ever saw him.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.840
Yeah.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.840
That was heartbreaking. That was really hard.

00:21:54.840 --> 00:22:02.840
But he was lucky enough to bring them over here and take them to Hatch as well. So when

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.840
he had the opportunity and the funds, he did call my grandparents here and they stayed

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:13.840
a while. So I think that was something he felt like such a big achievement there, didn't

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.840
he? That he was managed to get them here and then take them to Mecca.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.840
Sometimes they used to go together and it was a bit more difficult for us with being

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:26.840
in school and whatever. And sometimes they would take it in turns to go. So they always

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.840
kept that connection with Pakistan.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.840
Yeah. So every few years. It wouldn't be every year. For every few years one of them

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.840
or both would go.

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:39.840
What did they speak of as their early experiences in the UK?

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:55.840
Cold. Wet. Food was different. They felt isolated. That's why you find within our communities

00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:02.840
why they're all so together. So you go down the street and it's mainly Asian because

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:07.840
in those days you couldn't fit anywhere else where you were supposed to go.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:13.840
Everybody became everyone's support network from your own communities which is why they

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:14.840
all tried to live together.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:19.840
To keep near each other, yeah. So they always had that there.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:26.840
And you didn't have a car. So anything you wanted to go to get, like Mum would have to

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:32.840
take us all with her to go to the Saturday market, get all the fruits and the veg or

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.840
any groceries that they needed and then she'd walk there and walk back again because she

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:42.840
didn't have any other form of transport then. So that was difficult. She said it was really,

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:46.840
really hard whether it was snowing or we used to have a lot of snow and we used to have

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:51.840
a lot of rain but in those days we had to have really heavy snow. And she said she still

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:56.840
had to go out so she'd sometimes leave us at home. Don't move, you're in one room.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:01.840
That sort of thing because in those days it wasn't as strict as it is now. And she would

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:06.840
have to quickly go early in the morning, get her shop and get back again to us and you

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:10.840
know, with a heart all over the place thinking that she's left us, you know. And it was

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:16.840
really, really difficult times. You couldn't get halal food. So I remember one day my dad

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:22.840
bringing home some chickens. They were live chickens running around the room and he took

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:29.840
them out to halal them just so we could have chicken. And so, you know, it's not like it

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.840
was then. But even then it wasn't like you'd get halal restaurants and stuff. Even going

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:39.840
out was really hard, wasn't it? You couldn't sit somewhere and eat. There was nowhere for

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:46.840
you to go. So you were restricted in a lot of ways in integrating. There was no mosque.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:53.840
So my father was one of the founders of the Jamiah Mosque in Commercial Road in Newport

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:57.840
and helped build obviously the foundations of the structure. So just before he died he

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:02.840
managed to get the structure ready there. And it was like that for years afterwards

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:09.840
then because obviously the committee had disbanded at that time after that. And so people who

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:14.840
are from Newport remember a metal structure of foundations, steel structure still being

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:19.840
there for years and years and years until it's now built into the rest of the mosque.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:26.840
But yeah, he was very, he was really active in that, wasn't he? He was a businessman

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:32.840
and he used that to his advantage in the sense of creating that cohesion. He was involved

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:37.840
in so many things. He was involved in magistrates, home safety committees. He introduced halal

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:44.840
food to our health boards in Newport. He was on so many different committees and all sorts

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:54.840
because he really believed that despite what colour, race, religion you were, whatever

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:59.840
your background was, everybody should be living in harmony. He really believed that

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:04.840
that's what we could do and that's what we could achieve if we just all tolerated

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.840
each other's religions.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:23.840
Customs and traditions. As you guys have gone older, what customs and traditions have you

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:30.840
retained that your family has offered you at a young age?

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:36.840
We still, the children in the family have been brought up in the same way. They still

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:43.840
go to mosque when they're small, you know, to learn about the religion. We still have,

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:52.840
we still do Ramadan, we still do our Eids. So we've kept united as a family in terms

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.840
of the extended family. My brothers still live with my mum and their families so they

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:05.840
still live in an extended family because they are our support networks, you know, having

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.840
that so...

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:13.840
Why? Why have you preserved these particular traditions and customs? Why are they meaningful

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.840
to you?

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:21.840
I think mainly because mum was left on her own, she was quite young. We don't. She was

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:27.840
quite young. So we felt very protective of her. My brothers felt very protective of her.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:32.840
So there will come a time when obviously as their families grow things will change and

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:40.840
mum or none of us have a problem with that. But at the moment, we all feel mum needs to

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:47.840
be surrounded by that. She's done so much for us and it's our only way to give back.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:51.840
We see mum all the time, my brothers live there. So she's always, always looked after

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:56.840
and I think it just became a priority within the family. Yeah, you know.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:04.840
As well I think is to maintain our sense of identity as well because I, for example, never

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:12.840
used to wear... I've been to Uomra twice and you know, on and off I wore a scarf but I

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:21.840
never really did at work because I felt like I should be trying to fit in. And one day

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:29.840
I thought, no, I've lost my identity trying to fit in with this society. I'm not going

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:35.840
to do that anymore. And I started wearing a scarf to work and was very surprised by

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:42.840
that reaction from a lot of people. People were almost not able to speak to me even until

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:50.840
I had to say my brain hasn't changed because I have a scarf on my head. And I found that

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:57.840
quite eye opening because when I wasn't wearing it, I think people felt that I was more like

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:08.840
them and now I am wearing it. I look different. So I think maintaining your identity in terms

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:16.840
of culture and in terms of religion is quite... is very important. I mean religion is always

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:23.840
played a really big factor in our house, particularly, you know, we read regularly, you know, we

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:30.840
have get togethers where we read the Quran just as a family, you know, for my dad. We

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:37.840
maintain as much religion and we keep on learning. And you know, the internet is a great thing

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:41.840
for the kids these days to learn more but we were taught the Quran when we were here,

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.840
when we were young. We were just taught how to read it so we can read Arabic from the

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:50.840
Quran but we can't understand it. So we don't know what we're reading but we're reading

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:58.840
it. And so, you know, it's a bit different now. There's more knowledge out there of transliteration

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:03.840
and stuff. And the way the world is changing so fast, it's so fast paced at the moment,

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:09.840
I think it's really important for the next generation, the youngsters now, to keep that

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:14.840
family unit for them to understand. So when they're all together, that culture is still

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:19.840
there. I think the minute you start sort of expanding and going your own way, I think

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:24.840
they start to change. So they have their limits. They know what's right and what's

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:31.840
wrong. But I think it's really important for them to understand where they came from

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:36.840
and where they need, which route they need to take. I think there was always a fear from

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:42.840
all people that came from Pakistan that the children that grew up here would become too

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:48.840
westernised and would lose their way, would lose their religion, lose their values. You

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:54.840
know, people here, they dress differently. You know, that even going to the cinema was

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.840
such a big thing when we were young. You know, it was, you know, why would you want to go

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:05.840
to a cinema, you know, when you can watch things at home? And it was that fear, I think,

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:10.840
that, you know, they might lose their way. You know, how do we hold on to that religion

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:17.840
and that culture? But I found over time that there's been a dip and there's been a peak,

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:24.840
isn't there? Because all of a sudden everybody is moving towards Islamic religion in a real

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:29.840
big way and finding out more about it, learning more about it. Learning that Islam actually

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:36.840
means peace, you know, and learning how to live in a more tolerated society. Whereas,

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:42.840
you know, there was a time, was it, when everything was just trying to find your way, wasn't it?

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:46.840
Well, even if we wanted to go to a restaurant, mum would say, well, why can't you cook at home?

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.840
Yeah. Don't you need to pay to go to eat? I don't understand.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:58.840
What traditions or cultural practices have you possibly even adapted or updated, do you

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:02.840
feel, as being another generation? Because I think that tends to happen a bit and you

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.840
just make, you know, you have cottage pie for iftar or something like that.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.840
Yeah, exactly. Well, obviously, yeah.

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:14.840
I've been chilling in my lasagne. I think the food definitely has because they're

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:21.840
young and it's good for them because they can't just, they need to fit into society

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:27.840
and be able to socialise in a confident way. But can you remember as, when we were younger,

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:32.840
that dad used to love foods from different countries, so he'd come home and we used

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:39.840
to have on a Sunday, on a Saturday, we used to have like javals, rice, all the traditional

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:45.840
curries and everything. And on a Sunday would be roast dinner. And we would have a roast

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:50.840
dinner in the same way, with no spices. It was just like a proper chicken roast with

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:55.840
all the vegetables and everything. And a friend who are Pakistani used to say, they're having

00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:01.840
English dinner in their house because they saw that as an English dinner that, and I

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.840
used to say, it's the same food, it's just cooked in a different way. And they just couldn't

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:11.840
understand. And even to this day, and you know, this generation's on now, when we're

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:16.840
talking about what you're cooking today, in our house, they still say, oh, we're making

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:22.840
English dinner because it's in their heads. Sometimes we used to call it that. But the

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:27.840
menu as such has changed because the kids want to eat differently. So, you know, there's

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:33.840
pastas and Italian and pizzas and, you know, you name it, food has totally changed.

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:38.840
But clothing, the way we dress has changed as well because when we were younger, it was

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:44.840
always seen as you would wear, you know, clothes that were traditional, even if you were out,

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:49.840
you know, you would wear the traditional dress. And my father was a little bit more liberal,

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:54.840
as long as we were covered, you know, he didn't mind sort of, you know, what their tops and

00:33:54.840 --> 00:34:01.840
trousers looked like. And, you know, you know, we even had people from the community, didn't

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:06.840
we, ringing home and saying, I saw your daughter.

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:11.840
Dresses on the top, jeans on the top, where's she going?

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:16.840
And, you know, my parents would say, well, she went from home like that.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.840
So she's going to come home like that.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:23.840
And then we had people that used to actually go into the house and then change their clothes,

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:28.840
just to fit in, just to fit in in society, and then re-change to come home, you know,

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:32.840
just so they didn't miss, they feel like they were missing out on something.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:39.840
So this generation are very lucky because everything is so much more liberal with them, you know.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:44.840
We were brought up with the attitude, look, you've got to save, save, save because you have to

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:49.840
save your money to make sure that you have a better life for yourself.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:54.840
You know, you need to buy your own houses. You need to, you know, make sure that you have enough

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:59.840
to live on, you know, don't live off the state, work hard.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:04.840
You know, we had a really strong work ethic.

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.840
But that's because of the struggles that they had faced, that they'd come through.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:11.840
Obviously they were always going to, you know.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.840
I find that's different with the children that are born now.

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:21.840
I find that everything that people didn't have is given to them on a plate.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.840
So, you know.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:27.840
There's definitely a change, definitely a change, you know.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:32.840
They want to go out all the time, they want to eat out all the time, you know.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:33.840
I remember.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.840
Buy iced coffees and things, it's a daily thing, it's not like a treat anymore.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.840
For us when we were growing up, that would be something you were saved for,

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:40.840
and then you'd have a treat.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:44.840
But now it's like, oh, I'm just going for a coffee or I'm just going out and go for lunch.

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:47.840
You know, it's totally different, isn't it?

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:54.840
And it was different in terms of the housework and everything because we didn't have microwaves,

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:55.840
we didn't have washing machines.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:02.840
I remember mum washing by hand and I remember mum using towels for nappies,

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:07.840
the traditional nappies and having to wash them and hang them on the...

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.840
I think everybody used them, they didn't have disposable ones then.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:11.840
And now it's so easy.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:16.840
And yeah, I can remember dad having the first colour television and thinking, oh wow,

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:20.840
and it was all those like lines on there, that one was sitting there like...

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.840
And dad was the first person in the community to have a car.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:24.840
Yeah, in our street.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.840
It was such a massive thing.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.840
So he had a brown Humber.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:28.840
Humber sector.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:30.840
Yeah, Humber sector.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:39.840
Have you got any heirlooms or mementos or ornaments that remind you of your parents' upbringing?

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.840
So I have got...

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:49.840
So back in the day when my mum got married, traditionally they still do it now,

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:56.840
but they used to give a big chest and in that chest there would be plates and rugs and crochet,

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.840
hand crochets, you know, pillowcases and things like that.

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:04.840
So from my mum's chest I have her...

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.840
What they gave her was...

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:11.840
It's called a lota, but basically it's what they use to clean themselves in the bathroom.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:15.840
So when people use jugs and things these days, so it's a bit like a bidet,

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.840
but it looks...

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:21.840
I don't know how to describe it, but it looks like a measuring jug with a little...

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.840
Spent.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:24.840
Spent on it basically.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:28.840
But it's quite intricate because obviously it was given to her when she got married,

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:33.840
so obviously they're kind of engraved, you know, it's quite posh, one of you like.

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:37.840
So it's never been used, it's just, you know, so I've got that.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:43.840
And I've also got a little from my granddad when he came for the first time.

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:48.840
They didn't have what's called a hookah, which is what they use in...

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:49.840
Like a smoking pipe.

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.840
Like a smoking pipe, which they use in shisha bars these days.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:58.840
So he made one, like a little bottle and a top and wrapped it up and whatever,

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.840
and it's got a little spout and everything.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.840
So I have that as well.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:09.840
And I don't have any air rooms, but I do have some of dad's clothes still, like his suits.

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:12.840
My dad was very suet and booted, he was a very smart man.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:17.840
And so I still have one of his suits, and it still smells of my dad.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:26.840
So, I've just got like a mum's, you know, surma that they put in the eyes, the line of the coal.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:30.840
Used to keep it in like sort of like silver little trinket pots then.

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.840
So I've got that.

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:35.840
I've kept that for many, many, many, many years, so I've got that.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:41.840
And I think, don't you still have the first grand shif that was given to you by mum?

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:42.840
Do you still have that?

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:43.840
I still have my grand.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:49.840
Yeah, so it is a little bit worn, but it's like, like, decades and decades.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.840
I read my grand when I was six, so I've had it since I was six years old.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:57.840
Yeah, and that was passed on, it was one of those that's been passed on.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:06.840
Well, the reason I ask is, in the monks' people's collection, we can digitise air rooms if you want them to be.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:10.840
So photographs can be scanned and restored, tapes can be restored.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:15.840
If you have ornaments, they can be photographed if you want those to exist in another format.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:19.840
So that's up to you when that moment comes.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:27.840
I've got a case of dad's cassettes, but I don't know what's on them because I haven't got a cassette player.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.840
They're kind of just people's collections.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:36.840
But there's things in there, there's probably, there's a cassette somewhere with dad's voice in it and I don't know where it is.

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:42.840
So at this point, I mean, I've got one last question, but that's going to be about Agent Live.

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.840
I think this is over to you now.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:49.840
If there's things you've not mentioned that you definitely want to get on file, now's the chance to speak them.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:40:01.840
So you went through a chronological order of, you know, originally India to Pakistan to migrating to arriving to working.

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:06.840
And then customs and traditions that you can maintain.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.840
Is there things that you feel you want to add at this point?

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:13.840
And if you want me to ask a question to trigger it and say, yeah, yeah.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:27.840
Well, you probably don't need to know this, because this is just a little bit of the history that, you know, one of the things I probably would have liked to mention that

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:32.840
Dad left his whole life behind, his family and everybody.

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:46.840
And, you know, but this wasn't the first time that Pakistan had helped Britain, because in World War I,

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:56.840
like 400,000 Indians came over here to fight in the war.

00:40:56.840 --> 00:41:01.840
And many Pakistanis and Indians died alongside British troops in that war.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:07.840
And I think that's often forgotten that this wasn't the first time Pakistan came to the aid.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:13.840
It was India then. So the people from the Indian subcontinent at that time came over here.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:20.840
So I think sometimes people forget that this is like a history of people coming here to help Britain.

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:27.840
It wasn't just, you know, the August 1947 partition.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:32.840
I'll ask that as a question. So, I mean, from your perspective, based loosely on what you just said,

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:42.840
what scales do people need to be aware of how integration and migration has benefited the country?

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:47.840
How do you want to display that really? You can talk about that if you want to.

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:49.840
We can read it out, it's up to you.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:54.840
Okay. Because you're an editor anyway, aren't you? So I just, I just, so.

00:41:54.840 --> 00:42:05.840
I mean, I've already said the part where dad was very perceptive and told us stories about Britain and its experience.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:10.840
He used to say, we are here because they were there. And one day they will tell us we don't belong.

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:15.840
And at that time we thought he was being humorous because my father was a really, really funny man.

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:21.840
But, you know, unfortunately, some of those things ring true for us today.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:27.840
And the partition in India saw the end of a 200 year British rule.

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:38.840
But I'm not sure if people know, but the British Pakistani community is one of the oldest and the largest ethnic minority community outside of Pakistan.

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:47.840
Here, the UK's open door immigration policy, they allowed members of the Commonwealth to apply here.

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:55.840
But that was for Britain's post-war labor needs, being promised the land of milk and honey, leaving everything behind.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:43:04.840
But pre-partition, everyone lived in India and there was 400,000 Indian soldiers fought for Britain in World War I.

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:09.840
Many Pakistanis and Indians fought and died alongside British troops.

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:13.840
So Great Britain coming here was not so great.

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:18.840
The reception for the Pakistanis was far from welcoming.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:28.840
And I worry about that today because we see people coming into the country today and even today certain communities are welcomed more than others.

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:35.840
Particularly in the recent Ukrainian crisis, for example.

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:45.840
That wasn't like the Afghan crisis where we had actually gone from Britain and interfered in people's lives.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.840
This was something else that had happened.

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:53.840
But the welcome the Ukrainians received here, the support they received, the ability to work,

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:57.840
it was very different from asylum seekers and refugees that come from other countries.

00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:05.840
But it was a far cry from Pakistani society where they lived in tight family units.

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:12.840
Generations resided together and there was a fundamental support network.

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:17.840
It wasn't easy for first generation immigrants and racism was widespread.

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:23.840
They didn't look the same. The color of our skin, our language, religion and culture became a problem for many.

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:30.840
My father realized the color of his skin somehow disqualified him from being British.

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.840
And he couldn't understand that.

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:41.840
He'd come from an Islamic religion which instructs Muslims to wholeheartedly help the needy, the destitute, without considering color, creed, race or religion.

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:49.840
The weather here was cold and the food was unfamiliar and appetizing and not in accordance with cultural and religious requirements.

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:55.840
In the mid-60s, discrimination of skin color became illegal.

00:44:55.840 --> 00:45:00.840
But on the other hand, there was an increasing concern over rising immigration.

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:13.840
The government imposed a series of immigration acts which effectively ended migration into Britain from the Indians of the continent, but that included the Caribbean as well.

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:18.840
So the black and South Asian people that came here did feel that they were under attack.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:26.840
So the country that they voluntarily had come here and they were asked to come and rebuild turned their back on them.

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:30.840
That affected hundreds and thousands of immigrants.

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:39.840
But they settled here, they filled manual jobs and steel mill jobs and textile industry jobs.

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:42.840
And for that, like we said, it was the railways.

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:47.840
He was only 18 when he came here.

00:45:52.840 --> 00:46:05.840
We've spoken about sort of him, the way he lived in one house and how he used to share the beds and how determined he was really to make a good life of himself.

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:08.840
I bet him buying his house.

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:20.840
So he co-founded the Gwent Community Relations Council.

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:24.840
So in 1984, he co-founded the Gwent Community Relations Council.

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.840
That was in Newport.

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.840
And he became an executive member.

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:37.840
And he was representative on the Home Safety Committee, with local authorities, with the police magistrates.

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:45.840
And obviously all the work that he did with the Jonya Mosque and the Halal Food and Goodness that he introduced in the health board,

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:50.840
which with dietary requirements that help you to recover better.

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.840
There was nothing people just sometimes wouldn't eat until they go to hospital.

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:56.840
There was nothing for them to eat, apart from mashed potato.

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:01.840
So that was a real turning point.

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:08.840
But he was a modest man, and many of his contributions were done silently.

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:11.840
So he helped a lot of people in the community.

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:20.840
It was only after his death that people would say, he helped bury my daughter, he helped me buy a car when my car wasn't, you know, he gave me money when I was struggling.

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:30.840
He helped so many people to the extent that when he died, some of his friends refused to ever travel the road he lived in again because he just wasn't there.

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:34.840
There were thousands and thousands of people at his funeral.

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:37.840
They had to close the streets.

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:45.840
And the funeral processions took place here in Dewsbury in London, and right across Pakistan as well.

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:56.840
So he's remembered by both young and old as an inspirational, happy and kind family man who always helped, mentored and guided so many people.

00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:00.840
He was always there, never missed a funeral or a wedding.

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:03.840
He was always there at funerals, he always helped bury every person that died.

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:07.840
He never, ever missed it and treated everyone as his own.

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.840
Nothing was too much trouble.

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:13.840
And even to this day, both young and old, will say he was my friend.

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:16.840
And it's only last week I was at a funeral.

00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:22.840
And quite a young person actually said, you know, he was my friend.

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:28.840
And even to this day, he's been 29 years on the 20th of August.

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:32.840
And even to this day, people still remember my father.

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:44.840
When I think about my upbringing and what I love, I think of all that despite all the struggles and the racism experienced, we were brought up in a loving family.

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:47.840
Advocates for togetherness and peace.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:52.840
We were taught to respect and be inspired by all religions and cultures and create bonds.

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:57.840
I always remember the overabundance of food and being surrounded by lots of people.

00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:07.840
And I think of the values of my faith and how my parents taught me those and taught me how to be honest, to love, be kind and generous.

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:11.840
They're the values that our parents passed on to us.

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:16.840
Due to all his hard work and sacrifices and my mother's.

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:22.840
My dad said, we are here because they were there and one day they will tell us we don't belong.

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:30.840
Your children, dad, will say we are here, dad, because you were here and we will continue your legacy to help us belong.

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:34.840
Thank you very much.

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:38.840
I mean, my next question is just going to be about Age Alive.

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:41.840
How did you get involved with Age Alive?

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:46.840
This is a funny story. You can tell the story.

00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:51.840
Well, for a number of years, pre-COVID, we kept saying that we wanted to join something.

00:49:51.840 --> 00:50:00.840
And all the groups seemed to be older and, you know, or they weren't sort of like because we both work, they just weren't suitable for the date times and dates of work and whatever.

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:06.840
So we kept saying to each other, it'd be really nice to do something, a hobby of something, let's do something together.

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:14.840
Anyway, so one of my friends said, why don't you join a group called Coffee and Laughs?

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:20.840
So we sort of said, oh, shall we sort of say, should we go along and just see what it's about?

00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:26.840
So let's go and have a little chit chat with them and just see if we fit in or if it's something we want to do or don't want to do.

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:32.840
They were looking for donations and you had found loads for, they've got a group there called Baeby Bundles.

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:36.840
And you had lots of like denny's and baby bottles.

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:43.840
Yeah, I'd gone somewhere and they had these things on offer and I bought them and thought, well, I need to donate them now.

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:49.840
Where do I donate them? And then I got in touch with Ingrid Wilson and she said, well, we run a Baeby Bundle.

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:53.840
Why don't you come along and bring them on the same day with you? And that's how it started.

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:58.840
So we went there and we just took to it. They took to us and we took to them.

00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:05.840
It was really, it's really funny because a lot of them are older than us, even though everybody's over 50, I think now.

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:09.840
And it was like, I kept saying, I can't think of anything worse.

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:14.840
You know, that was my original. But when we actually got there, it was quite amazing.

00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:19.840
Yeah, they took to us and straight away it was just like, oh, yeah, they really were so welcoming.

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:23.840
And we thought, that's OK. This might be something that we want to do.

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:30.840
And then a few weeks later, we walked in and they were having a reshuffle within the group

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:37.840
because some of the sort of founders of it now want to pass things down, pass some responsibilities down.

00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:41.840
So I walked in and they said, oh, there she is. And I said, oh, what have I done?

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:44.840
And they said, oh, you're going to be the new chair of Coffee and Laughs.

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:49.840
And I said, am I? And they all said, yeah, before you walked in, we all voted you in.

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:54.840
So it's got to be you. So I'm now the chair of Coffee and Laughs and have been for quite a while now.

00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:56.840
So that's how we got involved in that group.

00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:00.840
And that came alongside Age Alive because that's another group in Newport,

00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:05.840
which most of the members of Age Alive are part of Coffee and Laughs as well.

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.840
So that's how we got involved with both of the groups.

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:10.840
And we've done many things with Age Alive and we've invited to.

00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:13.840
We've sent some Windrush songs with them.

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:17.840
Yeah. So that's how that came about.

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:23.840
What do you feel is the importance of projects like Age Alive and Coffee and Laughs?

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:28.840
It's just the coming together of people who would not necessarily have anything else to do.

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:32.840
It sort of takes away that loneliness.

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:36.840
A lot of the ladies there have lost partners.

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.840
They're not in family groups.

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:41.840
They are on their own. They're all from different backgrounds.

00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:48.840
So it just brings them together and gives them a bit of a light to look towards things.

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:50.840
They've got events to look forward to.

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:56.840
They know they have to get up and get dressed and look nice and go out and meet other people.

00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:01.840
It gives them that sort of life again, where they've just been stuck at home doing nothing,

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:03.840
especially during Covid. That was awful.

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:10.840
So this is like their little getaway, which they wouldn't necessarily do or know how to do.

00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:14.840
I think it teaches them as well a greater awareness.

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:16.840
It gives them more skills.

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:21.840
It gives them opportunities to try new activities that they perhaps hadn't grown up with trying.

00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:25.840
I can't imagine what it would be like if someone said,

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:28.840
do you want to learn a bit of flower arrangement?

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:31.840
They would just do things you just didn't do.

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:35.840
It's like anything. If you don't try, you don't know if you enjoy it.

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:40.840
I think this is a way of them not only trying new things,

00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:47.840
but having those skills and maybe then carrying that on if it's something that they enjoy doing.

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:55.840
And with these kinds of groups, unfortunately, I've seen lots of groups over many years set up and fall.

00:53:55.840 --> 00:54:00.840
The reason for that is because of the funding. People just don't have the funding to carry on with groups.

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:06.840
It gets people learning about each other's cultures.

00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:08.840
It's about the confidence as well.

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:12.840
You see some of them who were very, very quiet in the beginning when I first started.

00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:18.840
They're so confident now. They're vocal. They'll say what they want to say.

00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:21.840
They get involved in so much more.

00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:27.840
We organize different sessions for them, whether it's yoga, whether it's making something,

00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:30.840
whether it's all to do with health and well-being.

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:36.840
They're not shy to talk about their problems in front of other people.

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:42.840
They enjoy that, don't they, to get other people's take on what they might be going through.

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:45.840
They don't feel like they're the only ones that are going through something.

00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:48.840
There are others like them, and that's a big thing for them.

00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:53.840
It's been a massive contribution to helping towards people's mental health and well-being.

00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:54.840
Absolutely.

00:54:54.840 --> 00:55:00.840
But we can only go to the groups. We don't come to Age of Life every week.

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:03.840
We both work. We're both professionals. We both work.

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:07.840
Everything that we do voluntarily, we do in between.

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:09.840
We volunteer with lots of different things.

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:17.840
We volunteer. We do a lot of work in the mosques right across the Gwent, really.

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:24.840
We've been involved in setting up, looking at new mosques in areas where there aren't mosques,

00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:29.840
open days for women, and lots of things.

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:32.840
So we get involved in things, but we do it.

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:37.840
They're extra voluntary activities outside our normal everyday work.

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:41.840
Is there anything else you would like to add on record?

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:43.840
I've done my questions.

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:48.840
Do you want to know what we do for a living, or does it really probably not matter?

00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:50.840
You can do.

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:54.840
I just thought that's what our parents did. I don't know.

00:55:55.840 --> 00:56:04.840
It's a normal history project. I think modern day, current history is not the day.

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:07.840
Maybe in about 10, 15 years you can come back and do it.

00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:08.840
Or if I'm still here.

00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:11.840
Next age, you can talk about where you've gone to.

00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:17.840
I think we've got plenty there. That was exactly an hour.

00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:18.840
Was it really?

00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:20.840
One minute under an hour.

00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:23.840
We didn't know what to want until we kind of guessed.

00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:26.840
We were in the cast again. I'm not really sure what this is about.

00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:29.840
I said to her, not sure, and I said, funny enough, I typed something.
