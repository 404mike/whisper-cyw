00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.880
Right, this is Catherine McShane interviewing for the SWCCR Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:23.000
Project and I'm here with Ray Thoburn in Trowbridge in Cardiff and it is the 15th of October

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
2014.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.920
Ray, could you spell your name for me?

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.040
R-A-Y T-H-O-B-U-R-N

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.720
Fab, thanks. So what's your involvement been with Cardiff Carnival?

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:52.040
I tend to make the bigger puppets, the large, sometimes up to 11 foot puppets that you see

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.040
going around the streets.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.840
When you say you make those, is that at the carnival camp or...?

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:09.200
Most of the big stuff, the actual joining of the aluminium is done down at the carnival

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:17.280
camp. But we make a lot of stuff at home in preparation for it, if it's needed, depending

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.280
on what we're doing.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.280
What sort of things do you make then?

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:39.120
I made a knight, I made Queen Elizabeth I, made a giant mermaid, made a lot of wings

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:47.560
and a lot of shoulder joints for different puppets and found new ways of making the wings

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.160
and the shoulder joints as well. Because the way they were being made was a little bit

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.640
difficult to use.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.840
Is it that something you've got a background in then or is it something you've learnt there?

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.520
I've always looked for the easiest way to do things. I've got a background in engineering

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.800
and when you're an engineer you look for the easiest way to do things at the time with

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.800
whatever you happen to have to hand.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.040
So what's been the favourite thing that you've made?

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:26.080
Oh, the favourite thing. I don't know, I've enjoyed them all. I did enjoy making Queen

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:36.600
Elizabeth I because, well, it was the first major puppet that I got to pilot. I hadn't

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:44.200
really done much of the performance side of it before I made her. I enjoyed the piloting

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.200
side of that one. It was a lot of fun.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.200
So how did the crowd react to your puppetry?

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:01.200
I mean a lot of little girls screamed, which is quite a laugh really. And one gentleman

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.000
sticks out of your mind, he was clearly a disabled gentleman and he looked all forlorn

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
by himself. So I left the parade and went and teased him for a couple of minutes and

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000
when I left he was laughing so I thought that'll do. That's him cheered up for the day.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Oh, fab.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I enjoy that side of interaction with the crowd. Just sneaking up on young children

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.600
with a huge pair of hands stretched out in front of you. When they look up and see what's

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.600
coming they do scream.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.600
So making children cry then?

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.600
Yeah, basically making children cry. It's my life's dream.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.600
So how many have you done?

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.600
I don't know. I've not really kept a count. I've done a few over the years but I've made

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.600
stuff. Before Carnival it was quite big and quite meaty. I've always had a handkerchief

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:10.320
to put things together and just do things. It hasn't always been practical, it hasn't

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:17.320
always been functional but I've always made things and did things by hand. It's just the

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.600
way I've been brought up.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.600
I hear that you've helped quite a few other people.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.600
Yeah, but I don't enjoy that part of it at all. I get no thanks.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.600
Oh really?

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.600
Not whatsoever. I don't think I bother next year. I'll leave them to rot.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.600
So what do you enjoy most about it, about Carnival?

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:51.600
Well, to be honest, when I first went down, when I first walked in through the door, I

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:58.600
felt a little bit out of place. But there was a really nice girl there called Caroline

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.600
who she came straight over to us as new faces and she really made us feel welcome. She was

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:16.600
a star she was that year and we're still friends now. She proved herself to be a star, a real

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.600
team player that year and she really welcomed us on board. Which was something that some

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.600
of the others didn't really bother doing the first year. We were welcomed the second year

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.600
by. There was returning friends. But the first year, Caroline really came across and really

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.600
made us feel welcome. I was grateful for that, for that input. Without that I might not bother

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.600
for a second year.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.600
And is it something you're likely to continue with?

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.600
Oh, I can't continue going down. Yeah, we've been set on the right foot. There's a lot

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.600
of lovely people down there that we've gotten to know over the years. It would be a shame

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.600
if we didn't get to see them every year.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:04.600
Have you got any kind of memorable moments, either kind of carnival camp or on parade?

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:18.600
I don't know how memorable it is really, but there was an instance where I went up to one

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:25.600
of the guys that was making a structure and I pointed out a weak flaw in the design. And

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.600
I more or less got told, don't be silly, it's fine. But that person, she came and admitted

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.600
that she slept on that, woke up in a cold sweat in the middle of the night and said

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:45.600
that bugger's right. And she went and changed it and that worked. That costume worked because

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:53.600
of that. And I got thanked for that one as well. In a kind of backhanded sort of way.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.600
Well, no one likes being told they're wrong, do they?

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.600
Everything else was perfect on it. It was just that one little part I could see it wasn't

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:07.600
going to feel. I could see it wouldn't work. But she put so much effort into everything

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:14.600
else that that little bit was just something she'd missed. One little tiny detail. But

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.600
there we are. She's seen it now.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.600
There we go. And friends you've made, you mentioned friends that you've made along the

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:32.600
way. Yeah, yeah, we've made some lovely friends along the way. Some of us, well there's one

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:38.600
in particular, every year, carnival camp she comes and she actually stays here now for

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.600
the duration of the carnival camp. Then a week or two after. In fact you wonder when

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.600
she's going to leave some years. Where's she from then? Is she not from Cardiff? No, she

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:53.600
comes from Penzance. Oh right, so quite a distance then. Quite a distance. But yeah,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.600
she comes up and she's the perfect house guest. We don't know if she's there half

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:06.600
the time. So yeah, it's always nice to see her. And is she someone else who makes big

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:12.600
costumes then? She makes big costumes as well, yeah. She does a really good job of it. She

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:19.600
makes some belters, she does. Some real belters. Another really skillful individual. Nice to

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:31.600
see. Nice to see the results. And, because obviously all yours are sort of very big costumes.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:40.600
Is it really tiring by the end of the parade? Are you worn out? It depends. The first year

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:46.600
I was Queen Elizabeth because of the way that the elder shawl adjoints had been created

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:52.600
using various bits of steel and screws. That was a nightmare to try and get any sort of

00:08:52.600 --> 00:09:03.600
movement out of that. Because to move one area, the boxes were all turned in different

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.600
directions and they were starting to tighten up themselves and it was becoming really difficult

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:15.600
to move. And we had a discussion and we decided that from then on we wouldn't use aluminium

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:22.600
and stuff to make the adjoints. We would just use a piece of rope and from that day forward

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:27.600
all our costumes would be made with rope in the adjoints and we would not have had a single

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:34.600
problem with any mobility anywhere. It's been a lot easier since then hasn't it? A lot easier

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:42.600
to use them. So are they heavy? Some of them can be but if they're designed with enough

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:49.600
counter balance beneath them they sit really well. If they're top heavy they will tend to topple

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.600
over so you have to bear that in mind when you're making them. Make them heavier below your

00:09:54.600 --> 00:10:02.600
shoulders so they won't topple off or topple over. So you can dance in them then? Well some of the

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.600
ones I've made you can actually hold a dance in them. Some of the ones I've made have been really

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:14.600
very big indeed. But yeah you can dance and sing and chat around. It was actually Caroline again

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:23.600
she wanted to do a bit of jiving with Queen Elizabeth the first on the way up to the big weekend.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:31.600
So me and Caroline were jiving walking up the road and I was dancing in this big costume. That was a bit of fun.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:44.600
That was alright. That was a laugh. Oh great. So would you recommend being involved in Carnival to other people?

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:56.600
Well yes I would. Anybody who's got any sort of aspirations to perform in any shape or form should get down to Carnival.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:06.600
And just give it a try. At the end of the day those people are, each and every one of them is as different as

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:14.600
chalk and cheese from each other. But they all come under the main head of Carnival people.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:23.600
And that is just a crack of bunch of guys and girls. They're a real treat to be around. It's a pleasure knowing them.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:29.600
A real pleasure. Great. Thank you very much.
