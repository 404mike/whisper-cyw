Thank you, Jennifer, very much. And also thank you, Jerry and Betty, for sharing your thoughts and memories.

Now we will have from Braun Journey some more of his heart music.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Well, it was about 10 o'clock on a Sunday morning, and there was this man and this wife, and they were laying in bed.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And the wife said, you know, it's time to go to church. It's getting real late. You better get up.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And the husband said, you know, I just don't feel like going to church today.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You know, nobody really likes me there. I feel so alone. I'm lonely. And I don't know, I just don't feel like going.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And the wife said, well, you have to go to church.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And the husband said, give me three reasons why I have to go to church.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And the wife said, I'm your wife. I want you to go to church. Your kids, they want you to go to church. And you're the preacher.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
