00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
But of course also in the 18th century there was the big expansion of the hall itself, which we're all familiar with.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:20.000
There was never a big house on this estate until Thomas Wilson came and he built a house on that site, which was much smaller than that one.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But well-proportioned rooms, as you will see when you get my guide to the heritage.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And he excavated the cliff rather than excavated the ruin.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
They did some excavation, also from an archaeological point of view, therefore he chucked the best bits away.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And he wanted a romantic room in his garden.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It was a thing of the 19th century, late 18th or early 19th century.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But he raised the roads up while we go up and down the hump by the hall wall.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And his house was, I don't think descriptions are within sales particulars, a very nice house.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I think it was a tiny room, 30 foot by 20 feet or something.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Nice house, but there were only four bedrooms.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I'm not sure if he managed to live there, as I said, he went past and disappeared from the scene.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
But the Phillips really went to town with that and produced the 52 room house that we've got today.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And that again is a part of the mid-1860s when they were selling a lot of money here.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And of course times changed.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Eventually, after the Phillips passed, a lady called Mrs. Chamblin, I don't remember what her first name was.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
She was a wealthy lady.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I think her husband had, Mrs. Chamblin, and I think her husband was connected to the family of industrialist Chamblin in Birmingham.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
But I think his work was more in aircraft.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
But anyway, she was quite a wealthy lady and simply used it as her country retreat.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And I spotted and all that sort of thing.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So I seem to think of the past now, certainly here.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And then Portland, Victoria, bought it from I think 1996.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And for quite a few years it's been has been open to the public for people to go round and have a look.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And it was worth looking up to gain an impression of what a house of that period in the Gothic revival style was like.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So they were using the style of the day.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:01.000
That was the way to make your statement as a successful industrialist who had made some money.
