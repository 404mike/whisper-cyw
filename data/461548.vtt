00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In your opinion, what effect has the televising of rugby had?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's allowed the whole nation basically to see and witness what goes on.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Lots of people in their lifetime will not have seen a live game of rugby,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
whether it's locally or at a major club level, and certainly not at an international level.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I've gone to games and I've spoken to people who know it's their first time being there

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and the excitement of being able to get a ticket.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Certainly the television has put pressure on ticket sales, along with the cost of tickets nowadays of course.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So television has brought to the public that opportunity of enjoying that spectacle, that arena.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It's like putting the gladiators in, in a sense. There's the ball.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It's a moment really that certainly over the years, if you don't have Sky in England for a while,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
sold the rights of all the games to Sky so that everybody could see the England game.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I know there was a lot of disgust at that, whereas they've taken it off the actual, the normal channels of BBC.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I think for a year or two I think, I'm not sure, if ITV had some of the rights and their coverage was quite poor by comparison.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Maybe there was a line still, maybe they're going to offer the tangent.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:37.000
But certainly television has brought to everybody's home the opportunity of sharing in that encounter,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
in that hopefully triumph, and sharing then that moment of pride, enjoyment.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Because it certainly does. It's a moment where you feel, well, that was good.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And do you think televising rugby has had an effect on the community?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I think it does. It does. I believe that in the locality there's a number of clubs that have started in the late 70s and 80s

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
because of what was happening at the national level.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And that goes with a lot of communities in South Wales.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000
A lot of clubs have sprung up in the last 30, 40 years because of what was happening in the 70s with Welsh rugby at the national level.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I think it's had a major, major impact in that respect.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And it's also kickstarted a lot of mini rugby movements within rugby clubs that didn't exist before.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
People basically played rugby at secondary school level.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
That was the first time they would encounter it and then throw youth and whatever else.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.000
But nowadays it's certainly prevalent in most of the junior schools, rugbyers in some shape or form.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And at most clubs have major numbers attending on Sunday mornings to play mini rugby.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And I think that's because of the impact of television that's had on it.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Why can't we make that available to younger people?
