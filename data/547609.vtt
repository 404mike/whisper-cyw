00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
My name's John, John, how I long, long may he reign,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
On high, Lord, on high, so young and so young of age.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I do know God held him, God brought him from on,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Most high in the house of my Lord.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Lord God, light of your working heart,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Come all my kin, give me a strong hand,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
All others give me light of my heart.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000
God, God, light of your working heart,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Come all my kin, give me a strong hand,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:29.000
All others give me light of my heart.
