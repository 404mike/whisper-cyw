Abby Harvey

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.400
Dubbed by

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.380
cowardice

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:53.580
and

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:01.580
When the star-eyed, my willing heart,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:08.580
All made their love to thee.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.580
I pledge my faith, my life to you,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:24.580
The range that our great deal is bound,

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:33.580
And all our pride is to thee.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:41.580
Good well, O fair, our dear and close,

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:50.580
With hope the heart can reach the ground,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.580
And life on earth we hope.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:06.580
The whole of nation's life above,

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:15.580
And in the rising sun on yore,

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:24.580
Thou shalt be our guide.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:32.580
I pledge my life, my life to thee,

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:41.580
The whole of nation's life above,

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:49.580
And life on earth we hope.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:57.580
God, where art thou, and where art thou and I,

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:06.580
T'was well and well above the sky,

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:15.580
Above the clear blue sky.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:23.580
Amen.
