If we go back to when you were in school, you said you had lots of friends,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.280
so did you find it easy to make friends in school?

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:18.680
Yes. A lot of the friends that I've made, we went in the same class, so it made it easier.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.880
We got on really well. My other best friend that I've got,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.480
she is married and she's got a 10-year-old daughter who's very, very pretty.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:47.000
I've noticed that a lot of my friends are in relationships or they're married,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.480
which you can count on one hand how many friends I've got.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:02.040
But I just feel like I'm the only one out, that I've got no friends, well,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:10.120
not any friends here and I'm not in a relationship. I think I'm putting, again,

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.960
too much pressure on myself.
