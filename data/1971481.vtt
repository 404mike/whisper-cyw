00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
There's a guy called Mike Parker Pearson. He's the

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.840
prof of archaeology in charge of the big dig that's going on up in the

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.800
Priscelles at the moment, and that will be this summer.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.080
The archaeological dig is to pick out exactly where these stones came from

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.120
and how they were utilised. Talking to Mike, I mean he's a

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.160
Hecumenalist guy, he's a friendly sort of guy, he feels that they were

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.640
of a religious nature, but not religion as we would understand it now,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:38.480
but of a more sort of animist kind of thing. People obviously felt that the stones were

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.640
in some ways magic, they were very important, and people would venerate the stones, but they

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.800
would venerate the effort that was needed to make them into a circle. So they think that the

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.000
circles were important because they were aligned upon the solstice, the winter and summer solstice,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.920
of the year, so that they were aligned, specially aligned, so that they could calculate. Well,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.920
one argument is they would calculate the alignment so that they knew which time of year to plant crops

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.640
and which time of year to have their festivals. So there's a lot of information attached to that,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.920
which again, there's a lot of interpretation because nobody knows for certain because these

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.200
guys didn't read and write, so there's no written record, and it's really the edge of history

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.360
up there. But those stones were obviously very important, they were important enough

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.000
that people would transport them probably a month's journey eastwards to go to Stonehenge.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.800
Why on earth would they do that? Because they must have had thousands of people moving them,

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.600
and why they did it, we don't know. We think it's religion, we think it's to do with the

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:58.720
celebration of communal effort. I have one here, that's a prusselli bluestone, it's a chip,

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.880
it's not, it's not, the big one's very, very about three tons. But if you look at this very carefully,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.560
I don't know if you can see it very well in here, but it's got little crystalline structures in the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:20.160
rock. If you polish this rock like this, right, that is the sky, that's the stars, and that's the

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.480
constellations, and I'm sure that's what we old guys used to think. Yeah, so it's of interest that

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.680
they would get a three ton, four ton lunder this stuff and then cut all the way up to Stonehenge.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.600
They were highly motivated to do it, but whether it was religion, whether it was

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.880
the kind of animist religion that they would have had, I don't know. Their own religion,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.560
based upon the world in which they lived, so that they would relate more readily to something like

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.520
the spirit of the stone, or the spirit of the sky, or the spirit of the land, rather than saying

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:05.760
that there's an abstract sort of god hidden away somewhere. And their blue, dollarite I think,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.400
but it's a rock which is not uncommon. This one was found in a place where I go to house,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.960
just in the ground, and I had it polished because I had this idea. There's a couple of us who

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.200
think that the reason for having these stone circles is because they thought that the rock

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.720
was special in some way. But I've tried all sorts about trying to communicate with it,

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.720
and I've slept up the night up there. I've sat there listening all day sometimes,

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:46.080
but there's no vibes, there's no sort of magic. It's just a number up.
