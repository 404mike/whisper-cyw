WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
So then did you go to Moira Terrace for services as well?

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.920
Or what?

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.560
Well, yes, but only in the beginning,

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.840
because by that time I was engaged.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.800
And I went back to the Orthodox.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.120
So you met Louis by then, so yeah.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.840
Mm-hmm.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.120
Where was the youth club?

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.920
When you met in the temple of Peter, it was a youth club.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.800
It was actually in Lake Road East,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.440
Right.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.800
in the home of somebody called Maxon Myra Corn,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.760
and he was one of those who started the reform in Cardiff.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.560
And they had a cinema in there.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.880
He was actually involved in film work,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.280
and so they allowed us to use the cinema.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.240
Right.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.240
And we had our meetings there.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.120
At the cinema?

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.840
Yes.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.560
Or his home?

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.520
At the cinema.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.120
Did you put on some plays there?

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.440
No.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.320
Did you say?

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.120
No, no.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.080
Okay, right.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.640
So what did you do at the youth club?

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.080
Well, we arranged talks among ourselves,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.360
and we did have some play readings.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.640
Okay, yeah.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.200
And then we did outdoor activities.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.320
We used to go and we were affiliated to,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.280
you know, other clubs around the country

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.600
and other reform clubs, and we'd get together.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.800
It was very nice.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.080
So did you miss that when you went back to...

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.440
Well, no, because I was getting married,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.560
so it didn't matter.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.040
Actually, I was still producing for the reform

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.560
after I was married.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.520
Producing?

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.440
Yes, these Hanukkah plays.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.000
Okay, so where did they do the Hanukkah plays?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.880
In the synagogue?

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.240
Yes.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.740
Okay.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.800
In Moira Terrace.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.300
Yeah.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.600
Can you tell me some more about that?

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.080
How did you get people involved in that?

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.580
No.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.920
I mean, the children came and I selected the cast.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.160
I did do one play, a put-and-play in the orthodox.
