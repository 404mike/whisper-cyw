00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
My frozen feet are quilled with oil,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
He sends me the devil.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And in thy folly he lies afraid,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
His father, God, will help,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Though I feel you well.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
He doth no glory and none of us,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000
In honor and in favor.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And for I would not with him part,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.000
There where he be again,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.000
For God has found his way.
