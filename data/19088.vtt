00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
Oh, I had to go on the parish and there was soup kitchens started.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.440
People going out to soup.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.440
Oh yes, yes certain people.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.440
And I remember boys running about in no shoes and stuck in, about here.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.440
They were so poor to buy shoes.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.440
And there was cobbleroads then, it wasn't a road like today.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.440
They cracked the stones for men that were on the parish in the workhouse.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.880
Everybody had to come out on the roads and crack stones to make the roads.
