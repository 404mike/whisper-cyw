00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
My grandfather came over as a young man of about 19 years of age to London and

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.080
the chief rabbi Herman Adler at the time had this very good idea of sending

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.200
anybody that was Orthodox and had a bit of knowledge of the Talmud and the

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:30.440
laws of the of the Orthodox community to the outlying cities and towns in

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:37.960
England where the community had been sort of had landed up so to speak because

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.000
most of the time they were peddlers so wherever they managed to make a bit of a

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.200
living they sort of settled in that place and then toured the area so he

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:59.040
happened to send him to Lenehle as the Londoners call it and he became the

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:07.280
minister this was about 1900 according to the Barnetts it was 1899 but it's

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.640
neither here nor there they didn't have a synagogue at that time and they used to

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.920
meet in a house and in 1908 the community was big enough that they

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.520
managed to build a little synagogue which supposedly was built on the style

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.000
of that they had in in Belarus
