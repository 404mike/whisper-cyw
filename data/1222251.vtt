00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
But Clifton College was separate.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.560
Yes, because it was a public school divided into

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:16.320
how many boarding houses? Ten houses, seven of which were boarding, and one of which was

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.400
at the Jewish house. And it was the longest serving Jewish house in a public school

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.240
in this country. It no longer exists.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.720
It was called the Jewish house?

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.760
No, it was called Pollack's house because what they used to do was name the houses after the

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:46.240
housemaster in charge. And the Pollack's house was run by the Pollack, several generations of

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:55.280
the Pollack family. So what provisions were made for you there then at Clifton College?

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:03.040
Well, we didn't have to attend lessons on a Saturday. We had kosher food and we had regular Jewish

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.360
lessons.
