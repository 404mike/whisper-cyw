00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
How did you feel before you popped the question?

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.500
Very nervous.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.500
Why?

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.500
No, no, I just did.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.500
Just, it's not something you do every day, is it?

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.500
Were you frightened and were saying no and then you're destroying the friendship?

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.000
Um, well I was worried because I thought, well how would you both feel if she was to

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
say no?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And then we're living in the same place?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And we're all, yeah as you say, we're all together sort of thing and you'd always be

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
thinking, wouldn't you?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
But as things happened, I didn't have to worry about that for long.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
No, it's only after that was when you had to marry me.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Yeah.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
How did you feel when you hear them say the word?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I was shocked, I was.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I, I, I didn't think I'd ever be in that situation again.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Never.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I hoped, but like I say, I was happy, it was sort of like a happy sad because as I said

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I didn't think we'd ever actually get there.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So yes, the proposal came, but then you're thinking how are we going to get around all

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
the red tape that comes with it?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Did you leave him waiting?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
No, I don't think I did, did I?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Because I keep having more of a little bit of heartburn than I was.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Yeah, no, it was only two or three minutes, but when you're waiting for an answer, two

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
or three minutes seems a long time.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And then the kitchen staff came in with the dessert in there and they crept round the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
door because they knew he was reposing, they all kept knocking and they looked at Steve

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and they said, well did she say yes?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
He said yes and then Chris from the kitchen came in and he brought in a bottle of champagne

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and popped that so that would rub it in.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I've got pictures of that as well, the way the table was done, really nice.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So tell me about this red tape.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It was just the meetings and the meetings and the meetings and would you be better off

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.000
in the community and we didn't ever think that we would get two rooms like we've got

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
now and then that went on for what, three years?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Yeah, it almost got to a stage where all we seemed to be doing was repeating ourselves

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
each time we went, nothing really was moving.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Nothing was resolved, it was like come to this meeting and you'll get an answer today

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
but we didn't get an answer, we didn't get a concrete answer, not ever.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So was it just insurance purposes or something else?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
We don't know, we'll never know that.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
We're not 100% sure really.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So did you move in together after you were married or before you were married?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Well we moved in together only just a few weeks just before because obviously it would have been

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
more awkward afterwards.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I moved in here in the June and then we got married in the October but that was only because

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
we took the biggest gamble of our lives and we said right okay we're just going to do it regardless.
