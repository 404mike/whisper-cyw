00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.920
Here at HDA we would like to say thank you to Heritage Lottery Wales for giving their

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:19.360
support so that we were able to undertake this short series of podcasts about Tiger

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.240
Bay, Bute Town and the docks.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:34.840
This is the first of three parts which are conversation with Peter Phillips, well known

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:44.800
resident of Tiger Bay, musician, legendary for leading the funerals in a New Orleans

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.800
style.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.240
This is the first episode from Peter Phillips.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:02.240
So tell me tell me about childhood, early days.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.240
I had a wonderful upbringing.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:16.240
Born in 45 Christina Street Tiger Bay, 5th to 12th 1940.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.240
Got a twin brother called Roy and I am one of a family of seven.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.240
That's a small family for the Bay isn't it?

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.240
It all depends what family you're in.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.240
Yeah but you know what I mean some of the families were huge man, huge.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.240
When you say huge how you calculating that?

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.240
Well some people had eight or nine kids and others had you know less but some families

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.240
were really big.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.240
Well growing up in the area like Tiger Bay you never noticed the amount of families.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.240
We were all one family.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.240
That's one of the things that I always found interesting as you know I come from Barry

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.240
all merchant seamen families as well and that's the way families mixed in.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.240
Kids went to people's houses and had food and stuff like that.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.240
Well I keep on telling my grandchildren, said Grampy was 30 before I realized everybody

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.240
in the ducks wasn't my auntie.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.240
Yeah I know exactly what you mean and how many cousins as some people define them as

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.240
blood but otherwise how many cousins do we all have?

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.240
Well yeah you said it earlier we're all family I mean you would go and this is the problem

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:44.240
today when they killed the bay and knocked it down and moved everybody out you took the

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.240
society away you took family away because you move people out whereas you could pop

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.240
around the corner and see your auntie and uncle and your cousins go across the road

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.240
and see your granny or go around the corner and see your grandparents.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.240
Now you don't see that it's gone.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.240
By the time the children think about coming down to visit and getting the bus and getting

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.240
this and getting that they still would give it a miss and that's a sad sad fact about

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.240
the bay being crushed and that's what they did they crushed the bay.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:28.240
I mean even that thing about kids that feeling as a kid of feeling safe but at the same time

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.240
everybody every adult knowing what you were doing so your parents knew what you were

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.240
doing but you were safe weren't you?

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:44.240
Oh yeah I mean for example if I was around another street in the docks and a lady come

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.240
out and said do your mother know you're here and you say yes Mrs. Sorenso or yes auntie

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.240
Sorenso she'd say they'd say well make sure you're home by five o'clock and you'll be

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.240
gone.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.240
You wouldn't back chat you'd be gone because by the time you got home your mother and there

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.240
was no more by then but your parents would know where you were but that's community for

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.240
you that is community everybody cared about everybody.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:20.240
But that's it it was people talk about villages but it was a village within Cardiff a total

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.240
village.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:27.240
Oh it was fabulous if you come if you go down to Bute now there's only two ways to get in

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.240
and get out.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.240
Mariah Street and Loudoun Square.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.240
There's only two ways in and out.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.240
Whereas before you could walk and operate at the top you can get out to Sapphire Street

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.240
you can get out to Loudoun Square you can get out to Tuck Church Street you can get

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.240
out to North Church Street it's all gone all gone.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.240
There's two ways to get in and to get out Mariah Street and Loudoun Square and that's

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.240
it.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.240
It feels a bit like cutting people off from the rest of the world.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.240
Well that's their intention that's their intention what they would love to do is have everybody

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.240
out.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.240
I mean when they start knocking down houses and putting us all in them skyspapers what

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:15.240
should have happened is what happened in in Splott because in Loudoun Square if you if

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.240
as you said you've been to the docks in Loudoun Square you could have made beautiful beautiful

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.240
flats out of them big big houses.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.240
You could have made four flats in each house but no they knocked them down knocked them

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.240
down.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.240
And what they did they killed the community because they put people into flats myself

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.240
my mother and everyone and they took away the fact that you had a garden where you had

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.240
chickens and you kept your people happy but they killed all up they killed all the poor

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.240
houses and everybody had nowhere to go.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:54.240
Yeah and that and that thing the simple thing I can remember from my Nan in Barry that simple

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.240
thing of being on the doorstep.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.240
Gone.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.240
And the world going by and conversations.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:09.240
Yep you could always tell when it was summertime because everybody was out on the door.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.240
Everybody was up on the door and and you would check for everybody.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:20.240
But the sad sad thing about it as I say to you was that the people who crippled the day

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.240
don't even live here.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:29.240
No they don't even live here unless as you were saying earlier I told you in in the late

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:35.240
40s early 50s my mom's house was it quarter so Gala hands where they do all the pamphlets

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:43.240
and the leaflets because you Tiger Bay had a strong strong labor with a strong one.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.240
Now you don't even know your who your candidate is you don't see him.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.240
It was a melting pot that was beautiful.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.240
It never over bubbled.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:07:01.240
It was a melting pot and they whoever whoever it may be they just wanted to crush it.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:07.240
That's all I want to do was crush it and they achieved that.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.240
For no good reason they achieved it.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:18.240
Well you know you know Barry as I do and and and also the Bay much better than I ever will.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.240
And it's funny isn't it.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:28.240
You're the you're the people who generate the money that makes a place what it is.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.240
What would Cardiff be without the dogs.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.240
It wouldn't even be the capital of Wales.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:42.240
No no no and as I said to you that the sad thing about it is that the youngsters today

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:48.240
don't even know much about Cardiff because they don't even know what the court exchange means.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.240
They haven't got a clue.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:54.240
They don't even know when they walked on James Street and passed the piece of grass

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.240
past the police station that was the River Tuff coming through.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.240
They haven't got a clue.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.240
They don't even know about the badges coming through bringing the cold down.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.240
Yeah and the canal.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.240
They don't even know.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:12.240
They don't even know that that where they call Cardiff Bay ships would come all the way right the way up

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.240
to the top of Bute Street and unload spuds from Ireland for Edward England.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.240
They just think oh it's Cardiff Bay.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.240
They don't even know it's a basin.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.240
It's sad.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.240
It's sad.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.240
It is.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:30.240
It is because when all is said and done it's that legacy the sweat of real working people

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:35.240
and their families the women that brought us all up.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.240
Yeah.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.240
You know while the men were away or whatever.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:49.240
That's the minute that money stopped coming in like you know the dogs cold stopped at it.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.240
They knocked it all down.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:56.240
Well you just mentioned something there about being brought up.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.240
I cringe when I hear these people crying about single parents as you know.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.240
Our fathers were the way of seeing them.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.240
Catch an 18 month trip you never seen.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.240
Your mother brought you up and you got on with it.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.240
They went to work.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.240
They read this and now you hear them crying.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.240
Oh single parents single parents.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.240
But we were all brought up by single parents.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:22.240
And as you say your granny was involved making sure that you got the school clean and tidy.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:32.240
Yeah and if something happened if something happened so that a woman you know the mother of the family something happened to her.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.240
Those kids would end up in a different house.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.240
Someone would bring them up an auntie or whatever.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.240
Her best friend or an auntie.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.240
Well you must have you must have added in Barry like we did in the in the docs.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:52.240
You would see somebody who had been working with somebody and the next thing you know they've gone and moved in.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.240
And like you said they're like auntie they're like family.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.240
There was no discrimination no discrimination.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:12.240
I went to I went to South Church Street School and we had a young girl in our class who was a Jewish family.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.240
She didn't say prayer.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:19.240
She didn't go to to break in the in the in the school break in the playground.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:24.240
She used to come to school dressed as if she was in the private school.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.240
She used to wear a bowtie in the summer.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:30.240
She wore a bowtie hat and she was just accepted.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.240
As far as we knew she was our friend in school in the class.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.240
Yeah.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.240
And I tell you she was she was the niece of Mrs.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.240
Balford who got murdered.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.240
Right.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.240
Yeah.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.240
But she used to come to school.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.240
She didn't go to private school but she was dressed immaculate.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:52.240
And as I said you used to wear a bowtie a bowtie hat a bowtie hat.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.240
And in the summer she wear a summer hat.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:11:00.240
But as I said nobody passed no comment.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:06.240
And even even within families you could have you could have a Muslim and a Christian parent.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:12.240
People you know people it was as far as they were concerned like I both do what they wanted to do.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.240
They were family and that was it.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:21.240
And you might end up I mean I've been I've been down the mosque many times when I was a kid in Cardiff.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.240
You know you know my uncle was involved.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.240
You know I'm a Christian I was a Christian got nothing to do with it.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:46.240
I mean come in and how many young Christian boys ended up in places like the the back room of the Cairo cafe where there were Muslim lessons going on because they might win in.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.240
That's right.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.240
That's right.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.240
There's loads went to Arab school just to learn.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.240
It's it's a it's a fact.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.240
But like I'm saying to you it was a beautiful melting pot.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.240
Everybody knew everybody.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.240
I I'll give you an example.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.240
I had to attend the hospital the other month.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.240
And that's what happened.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.240
You know they come and take particulars of your name and address and everything.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:17.240
So this young nurse said to me did you ever live in the docks.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.240
Yeah it was born and bred in the docks.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:24.240
So she said oh I wonder if you would know my grandfather.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.240
So I said what's his name.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.240
She said so and so and so.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.240
I said yeah.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:36.240
I said and when you go home tell your mother that you was talking to Peter Phillips.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.240
She looked at me she said pardon.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.240
I said tell your mother that you was talking to Peter Phillips.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:48.240
She said my mother said your mother was in the same class as me.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.240
Your auntie was in a class higher because she's older than me.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.240
She couldn't believe it.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.240
She said I always wanted to know about my grandfather.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:06.240
So what you must remember is when we were growing up the only photos that the parents had was the father on his passport going to sea.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.240
It wasn't like this mobile.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.240
So she was on the phone.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.240
On the phone she texted her mother and her mother said give him my love.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.240
I haven't seen him for years.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:23.240
So I started to tell her everybody who lived in Christina Street that's where we lived.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.240
She couldn't believe it.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.240
She couldn't believe it.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:32.240
I told her who lived next door to her mother and the left side the right side and where I lived.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.240
God she said.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.240
I said where do you live.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.240
She said Pentribane.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.240
I don't know where are the people in the street.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.240
That's the difference.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.240
I said that's the difference.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.240
I said I just and she was taking notes on the mobile.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.240
Her mother said God Stuckies right.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.240
That's everybody that lived in our street.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.240
And I made the years of age now.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:14:01.240
And I can still remember who was in my classroom who I played rugby with.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.240
Boy went to school with.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.240
And it's just tremendous.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:10.240
But like I said she said oh God Stuckies I wish I had a father my grandfather.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.240
I said well they're not a bonus so they wasn't taken.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.240
Nobody took photos of them days.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.240
Especially with the semen.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.240
They just went to work and that was it.
