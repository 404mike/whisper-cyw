1919 workers strikes, the army and Belfast. Belfast was also presenting problems for

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:16.080
Prime Minister David Lloyd George. Firstly let me take you back, before the war there were a number

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.760
of strikes and I'd recommend the excellent work of Simon Webb in his book 1919 Britain's Year of

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.160
Revolution. In the years before World War One there was considerable industrial unrest which

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:40.080
peaked in 1912 when 40 million working days were lost across Britain. Then in 1914 the Triple

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:48.480
Alliance was formed. This was a triumvirate of the three big trade union areas coal, rail and dock

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.920
workers and only the war stopped a general strike that would have crippled the nation.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.480
Patriotism affected industrial unrest but by 1917 that atmosphere was changing and seamstresses,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:10.000
bank clerks, telegraph messengers and munition workers all went on strike. The government

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.680
introduced the defense of the realm act in 1914 which was draconian and forced citizens to do

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.400
some things and forbade them from doing others. One critical clause gave the government absolute

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:33.440
freedom to introduce further regulations as and when needed. For example engineers could not change

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:42.000
jobs without approval and it was an offense to suggest the war was a bad thing. Although some

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.920
rules were blatantly bizarre regulation 40b concerned the supply of cocaine to actresses.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:59.600
As soon as the war had ended there was the December 1918 election and David George had made three

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:07.760
significant promises all of which he was to break. One that those who had fought would return to a

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:16.720
land fit for heroes. Two there would be habitation for heroes and three demobilization back to Sibby

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.400
street would be speedy. Well no new housing had been built in fact while the men had been away

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.640
their wives had led rent strikes. There were few jobs and demobilization was slow

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.720
and Winston Churchill had tried to send the armed forces to Russia.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.280
So at the end of the war the trade union congress on behalf of all workers negotiated a reduction in

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:48.000
working hours from 54 to 47 a week. However this was rejected in a ballot of workers by three to one

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:56.080
and the rank and file chose to ignore the TUC. On the 27th of January the industrial war between

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.040
workers and governments began in Glasgow and in Belfast. Well we've mentioned Glasgow in chapter

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:09.520
seven of this. And when but in Belfast the general strike began the interesting thing was that workers

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.760
were not simply demanding less money less hours for more wages as was traditional. Instead they

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.920
demanded a 40 hour working week as an experiment with the object of absorbing the unemployed.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.440
The strikes were no longer simply strikes they were now a people's movement taking strategy out of the hands of government.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.440
In Belfast the strikers took control of electricity and the added issue was the general demand for Irish independence

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:41.360
which had led to the election of Sinn Fein MPs in the late 1920s.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:50.160
The strike was a result of the

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:58.080
election of Sinn Fein MPs in the general election of 1918. Six days earlier on the 21st the first

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:05.840
meeting of Dale Arron had occurred in Dublin declaring an independent Ireland on the 21st of January

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.240
and at the killing of two policemen in county Tipperary that same day at the beginning of

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.560
what was the Anglo-Irish war for independence.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:25.520
The strikers in Belfast the strike committee were in total control of electricity

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.480
they even were deciding which industry could have electricity.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:42.160
In effect no industry could have it but hospitals could. They were seeking to create a workers

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.800
parliament and government knew this was step one to independence but it was also bolshevism.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.160
As the Belfast newsletters headlined these objectives are not industrial they are

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.640
revolutionary. Well when workers in London announced they were going to join the general strike

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:11.600
the government had to act which it did very forcibly in Glasgow and it also then amended

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:18.320
the defence of the realm act making it illegal to deprive the inhabitants of electricity

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.920
with a penalty of six months hard work labour for any worker that did so.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.680
Well after gas and electricity had been disrupted for three weeks in Belfast the army was brought

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.720
in. Army detachment, Lewis machine guns mounted at the electricity station

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:46.240
and in other places led to the strike collapsing but it was now clear the army would be used to

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:54.560
bring order and that their orders were clear whatever force was necessary.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:02.880
So the Belfast general strike collapsed but the atmosphere of strikes in 1919

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:14.240
was to continue not least because the police went on strike twice in 1919 in London and in Liverpool

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:22.720
the government had to sack 2 000 police officers and make strikes by the police illegal

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.720
which is true to this day.
