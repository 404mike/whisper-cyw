00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880
The lifestyle was good but it was transient because a lot of the people on the island

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:15.440
were expatriates like David, either working for the casino or for the pharmaceutical company

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.520
Syntex or for Borco, the oil refinery company.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.400
And people came and went and the contract every year had to be renewed and there was

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.600
always, you know, is it going to be renewed?

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:35.160
We might have been thrown out sooner but so we never quite knew what.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.160
But it was a lovely life, beautiful sunshine a lot of the time, you know, a hurricane here

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.920
and there.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.440
We did have one after Alex was born.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.000
I had to go and shelter with the friends up in their place.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.160
No water, no water, electricity, phone for at least 48 hours.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.400
I remember making tea using candles, four candles, something on top and boiling water.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.200
Well, you had to be inventive, you know, we didn't have the mod cons in those days.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.200
That was in 79.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.520
Is there a Jewish community?

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.440
Yes, there is, yes, yes.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.320
I have photographs but not where I'd be able to get hold of them today.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.680
Yeah, there's a synagogue in Freeport.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.520
Usually the people who come were expatriates.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.120
A lot of the people were the people who lived there but people came from Miami as well and

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.640
all over the place.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.720
I don't remember if they held Shabbat morning services, certainly high holy day services.
