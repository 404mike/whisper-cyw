00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I did live in a tiny village at the foot of the Preselis.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.320
We arrived there from the Midlands towards the end of 1972.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.000
It was quite an experience.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.160
It only took me what about a month to realise that I was living in a completely different

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.160
world.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:37.720
The village at that time consisted of 11 dwellings and a pub which was an institution.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.120
I was once asked when I was district nursing and I was 20 miles away what the patient said.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.120
Do you know Jacobond?

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.000
I said, Oh yes indeed I do know Jacobond.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It was a very tight knit community.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Well, it took me about 10 years.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.720
And then I met four different people, all of whom were Welsh nationalists and who were

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.280
all very kind and welcoming.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.920
Both Peter and I, before we even came to Wales, knew that we were coming into a different

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.560
country with a different language.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.880
I had started Welsh lessons within eight weeks of us living there.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:33.560
I had looked around for the Welsh classes and decided on the one which was held at a

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.560
Skol Preseli in Crimyth, which of course is up in the Preselis.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.720
And I chose that one because it had a language laboratory which I thought might help me.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.840
On the way there, I'd gone just a mile.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.920
It was a very cold night, but clear moonlight.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.720
I knew my way along that particular lane and the car stopped.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.960
Well, I didn't know what to do.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:12.720
However, it had stopped outside a house which at that time had become the post office.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.720
It was called Hebron Post Office.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.520
And the lane went from one end.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.720
One end was called a place called Hleti.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.720
And the other end, it was Glandua, which was in Pembrokeshire.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.720
Well, yes, I chatted with the lady at the post office who had three children.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.720
And she said, oh, she said, well, my husband's out at the moment.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.720
She said, but I'm sure he'll be able to help you.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.720
And then I think she heard him coming.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:58.720
She walked up the lane with me along with her one year old who just had just learned to walk.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.720
And yes, along came her husband.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.720
So he said, oh, yes.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.720
He said, I'll siphon some off my car.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.720
I was just so kind.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.720
So yes, it did.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.720
That was my first acquaintance.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.720
And I felt as if I was in a different world.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.720
It helped to welcome me.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:30.720
Yes, of course, they all belonged to their own extended families and who all held together and helped each other out,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.720
which was something I hadn't had any real experience of ever.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:48.720
Regarding the Welsh lessons, I ended up with the ones that were being taken up at the local primary school.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.720
It was called Asgol Beca.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.720
I then began to learn about the Rebecca Riots.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.720
We were very near where the gate had been.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:15.720
And I think the only mistake that the teacher made was to not get us to do some homework because my life at that time was in a turmoil within the family.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:24.720
And well, yes, I loved the sounds of Welsh.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:41.720
And which came a year later, I managed to get a job in Carmarthenshire as a relief district nurse midwife district nurse midwife.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.720
Yes.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.720
And which took me into places that I'd never even dreamed of.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:05:08.720
And but before I started that, I made sure that I knew all the parts of the body and come right in Welsh and and so that I could say, oh, hello, Mrs.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.720
Whoever.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.720
How is your back today?

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.720
And then, yes, listen to her.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.720
Everybody did speak English.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.720
That was something that had surprised me a great deal.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:31.720
But when I asked about I mean, even the older ones had learned English, somebody pointed out that that was the language of finance.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.720
And of course, that rules everything, I think.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:47.720
And to only know a few words in in Welsh, I think it helps it make me feel more at home because I would go into a shop where I knew they were well speaking.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:54.720
And I would say, I can't remember how to say it now in Welsh.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.720
And they would come back with a whole load of Welsh, which I could not make out at all.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:11.720
As Haussmann said, the valleys and rivers and streams, a country of easy livers, the quietest under the sun.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:19.720
The Braceles themselves, I found, had very little water on them, which surprised me.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.720
.
