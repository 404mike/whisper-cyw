00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So you went to primary school, where did you go to primary school again?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well there was a school right opposite me, that's where the bomb landed.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
That was in 1941.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So can you tell me about the bomb?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Well it was a bio-German bomber trying to escape from a pilot,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and he had two left and he just got rid of them.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
One landed on the railway line, and the other one landed in the school gardens.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And only the houses one and two were completely ruined.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I was downstairs and I could see the stars through the ceiling,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
there was all the roof and garden and everything.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But only those two houses, and no one was killed.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You would have been about nine now?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Nine, yeah.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So what happened after that?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Well, you want the details?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
My father was the manager, my uncle owned a big retail shop in Penderacayva,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
which was four units in one, and it was on the top of a hill,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
so there was accommodation below and above.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So my uncle rented out the accommodation, but kept one flat for himself,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
because he lived in Cardiff, in case he got bombed out.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So we got bombed out, so we moved.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And we lived below and above the shop in Penderacayva,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and we stayed there for eight years.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
This was rebuilt after the war, and we came back here in 1949.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
After the house was rebuilt?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I think it was built, I think my parents rented it for a couple of years,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
because we didn't come back straight after, we came back in 1949 at home.
