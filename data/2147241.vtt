WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Question number one is can you tell me your name?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What is your name?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Shamim Bashir

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And where were you born?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Where were you born?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I don't know India, I don't know Pakistan

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
She doesn't know

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I don't know my mother either, she died when she was young

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
My mother died when she was young, so she doesn't know she was born in India or Pakistan

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That's ok

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
When did you arrive in the UK?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
When did you arrive in the UK?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
1964

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Can you tell me how life was as you arrived in the UK?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
When you arrived in the UK, how was your life? How many people were there?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It was hard

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Tell me how hard was it?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It was hard

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
There was no hot room, there was no water

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Cold?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Cold

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
There were no clothes to wear, we didn't even have a place to dry our clothes

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
She had kids, so we see drying the nappies were hard

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
When you came back, it was hard

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
In the winter, yeah, they get hard, you know when you put the washing out

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
This life is good

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
She said this life is better

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It was very hard

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Very hard

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
How was it harder? Was there any other problem?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Was there any other problem?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Was there any other problem with your tongue?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Yes, there was a lot

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Obviously, it's the language

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The doctor took her to the doctor

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Obviously her husband used to take her to see the doctor

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
How was it like making friends?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
When you were young, how did you make friends?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
We didn't have any friends

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
No friends at that time?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We had a mother-in-law and a brother-wife

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So they were family

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Yeah, they were families

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
That's it

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
They were just other family members who came to UK with their families

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
But no other friends

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
My husband is coming now, 12 years old

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Your uncle came first

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Your uncle came first

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Yeah, uncle came here, her husband came here 12 years before

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So she came in 1964 but he would have come in 1952

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
My husband's father, long time ago

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
There was a fight in his birth that he was here

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The father-in-law came and the German... was it the Second World War?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Second World War

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Yeah, Second World War

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Your grandfather, grandfather, and all of them

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
They were great grandfathers basically from her husband's side in-laws

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
They were here

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Were they all in the war or were they just here before?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Were they all in the war or were they just here before?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
They were here

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
They were residents of the UK

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
They were here during... before war

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Fish and chips shop

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I'm just going to ask, does Auntie want to check her scarf?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
You can take your scarf up

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Is that okay?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
If your scarf is up, you can take it up

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Is that okay? It's up to you

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
It's up to you? You don't have to take it up if you don't want to

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
No, it's okay

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
It's okay, it's fine

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Thank you

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So the question is going to be

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
What do you remember of your culture back home? Can you explain?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
They ask, when you were living in Pakistan

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
The culture, the traditions you had there

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
You tell them about that when you came there for the first time

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
The traditions...

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
How many people lived there?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
There were no electricity

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
No electricity but it was nice

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
No electricity

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
It was like this in Pakistan

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
It's a different Pakistan now

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
But at that time there was no electricity

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Big families lived together

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
We were not allowed to go out

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
She was not allowed to go out

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
No, we were allowed to go out

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Being a woman

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Burqa?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Yeah, they have to cover themselves

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
We call the Nikah of the Burqa

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
My grandfather used to tell me that

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
You have to go to school and study

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Granddad used to say that

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
What's the point of studying?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
At the end of the day you're just going to cook and make chapatis

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So the education...

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Old

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Old, yeah, old thoughts

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Now girls study

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Now obviously the girls go for higher education

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000
What part of that culture in India, Pakistan do you do here today?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
What do you think of the things that we do in Pakistan?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Meeting families

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
When you do things in Pakistan

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
You do some things here too

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Yes, we do

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Various things like food, weddings, festivals

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Knitting

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
She used to do knitting there

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
She used to make red cardigan over there

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And then she can do that here now as well

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Sewing

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Nice, very nice

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
She used to sew, she used to do the housework

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Cleaning, obviously cleaning the house

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Fire

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Yeah, fire, yeah

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Sometimes my husband, sometimes me

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
When you were in Pakistan, what did you do there?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
There I cut flowers

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Yeah, she used to do embroidery there as well

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Here you get a chance to do it

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Crochet

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Crochet

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
So those kind of things are now they're doing here as well, especially as a group

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
They used to make big sheets

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Big sheets, like bedding sheets, they'll do embroidery

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Pillow cases

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Pillow cases

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
As she said, back then you couldn't study

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Hard work

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Hard work

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Hard work over there as well

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
She said it was hard work over there and it's hard work here as well

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
What do you like about here, Wales?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
You live in Wales, right?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
We live in Wales, we don't have any food in Wales

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
What do you like here? What do you like?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
You're living here in the city for so long

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
We like everything

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
What do you like about here?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Do you like people? Do you feel safe? Anything?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I like shopping

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Shopping, go for shopping

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Go out with friends

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Go and visit friends

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Yeah

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Oh yeah, because of you can have some bits, yeah, some words I know

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Yeah, you can get some help from the group

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Mother-in-law, I go now

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Yeah, because my mother-in-law, they obviously, they are sister-in-laws

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
So she's passed away now

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Your mother-in-law, my sister-in-law

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So they used to meet a lot

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Okay, so my final question is what do you like about Age Alive?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
They used to ask me, what do you like about Age Alive?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
When we don't meet here in the marriage church

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Or sometimes here

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
What do you like about it when you do the exercise?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
When we go to the Age Alive group

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
We go to the group, we talk, talk, talk

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
We get to see each other and be happy

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
You must have learned a lot from the group

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
You must have learned a lot from the group

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
When you come here to do the exercise

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
We talk, talk, talk, talk

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Yeah, that's good

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
What is your final message for the future generation?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000
What message would you like to give to the children who are coming here?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
It's worth explaining because this will go in the archive

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
This is a chance for people 20 years from now to hear and read

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
So what is the message for that future?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
No one does anything bad

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
No theft

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Stay together

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Because we have come from different countries

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
So we should all stay together

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
You should respect the visitors

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
When the visitors come you respect them

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
You treat them nicely

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Reading, writing, writing, making good poetry

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
When you are reading poetry

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
You want them to work here

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Help the country

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
When the grandchildren read, they are happy

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
When the grandchildren come, hug, kiss

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
When the grandchildren come, they are happy

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
When the grandchildren come, they are happy

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
They give birthday gifts

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
When you say simple, what do you mean?

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Is there anything else you would like to say on camera?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Do you want to say anything else?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Do you want to say anything?

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
About yourself, your group, your family

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
There are a lot of things in Pakistan

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Sister, brother

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Still obviously missing the family

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
When you came, it was hard

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
We didn't have a heater

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
We had hot water

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
We used to boil the water in the saucepan

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
We had to do all the work

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Thank you very much

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Thank you very much

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Thank you very much

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Thank you very much

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Thank you very much

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
I think we leave it there

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
It's okay, you don't have to leave it there

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
No, no

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
No, that's fine
