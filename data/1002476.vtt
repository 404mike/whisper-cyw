00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Thank you Benton and Wynn. The gentleman over here taking the video taping is Mr. Dan Squire.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I thought maybe if you're wondering who he is.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We will now have from the Red Dragon brand their number.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
While they are gathering, I want to know if there are any special visitors today.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Is there anybody here from just over here from Wales?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I understand that there was going to be a Tricia Naylor who was an exchange teacher coming.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Is she here?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Will you please stand up? Welcome.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Applause

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And then a gentleman called me by the name of Phil Davies from Ames, Iowa.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Is he here?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Oh, welcome. We're glad to have you come.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Applause

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Now is there anybody else from out of state?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Well, we welcome you people from one from Iowa and the other from Wales.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I hope you enjoy.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We have name tags on trying to help people find someone who may have come from the same part of Wales that you came from.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So we hope that you will go around looking at people.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And finding out where they come from. Are you ready?
