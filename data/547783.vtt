WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960
went all over the place. I mean, the forms, oh, you name it, we were a pond of better,

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.320
oh, we won everywhere.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.560
A week's festival, imagine that, now six plays per week. You know, you wouldn't do it today,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.760
very, very, very difficult today. And I remember coming back now to Orkdale Institute and Blackwood

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:26.000
Institute when they had a week of drama festivals, you know. They'd be queuing for tickets for

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.520
hours and hours and hours, queuing, three and four abreast, to get a ticket to go in

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.520
for a week's performance six nights. Wonderful, wonderful. You wouldn't see that now. Of course,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.720
I blame television for that.
