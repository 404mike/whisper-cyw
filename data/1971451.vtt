00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
I play traditional folk music. Got a lot of friends who do that and I set up, I was the chairman of

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.320
the Fishguard Folk Music Club for many years, 20 years, and part of that was setting up a folk

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.800
music festival which we've had in Fishguard usually the last weekend of May and that folk music

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:28.080
festival attracts a lot of people, a lot of Irish people, because lots of the music in this area is

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.280
or sounds very Irish. If you look at the telephone directory in Fishguard you'll find an

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.840
awful lot of Irish names, so there's been a big interchange with people back and forth. Long before

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.600
the ferry was here, because this was one of the old medieval routes across to Ireland, Fishguard is

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.960
one of the few places where you get a safe anchorage on the north coast of Pembrokeshire. It's a good

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.640
place to land a boat because the way that the bay is configured means that you can hide a boat in

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.320
there and the weather doesn't get you. There's only Fishguard and Newport that you can say

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.920
that there's an all-weather anchorage and Newport has difficulties with the tide. It's not possible

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.040
to get into Newport Harbour or up the river into Newport when the tide is low, so Fishguard is

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.000
always a good bet. If you came around St David's Head anyone coming into Wales from the south

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.320
west would probably hit Fishguard first. So it made its money from being a port that you get to

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.760
quite easily off the main trade routes. That's why it was quite affluent. You've got a lot of

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.760
Georgian houses, you've got a lot of what looked like affluent houses for their time. Not so affluent

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:46.720
these days. But the fact was certainly back in Georgian times it was an affluent place.
