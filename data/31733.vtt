00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.400
Lips as red as roses Growing near a tree

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:34.400
Her mouth is like black petals, deaf as lilacs and poppies

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:46.400
Her hair is like cherry blossom, like long long daisy chains

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:58.400
Buttercups falling from the sky, a pyramid of curled wild roses

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:09.400
We love you mum, we love you mum Eyes like bluebirds growing

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:20.400
We love you mum, we love you mum Strawberries growing in the field

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:30.400
Poppies and earthy green grass One two three four five six seven eight nine

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:43.400
Chag, her hair, flowing in the garden Like roses growing in the fields

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:54.400
We love you mum, we love you mum Bluebirds growing in the forest

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:04.400
We love you mum, we love you mum Like lilacs falling from a tree

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:16.400
Her hair is full of red red roses Plated with red red roses

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:28.400
Cheeks like poppies growing in the autumn In the meadow with the big red sun

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:39.400
We love you mum, we love you mum Eyes as green as the grass in the summer

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:49.400
We love you mum, we love you mum Growing with your head held high

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.400
You are a colourful rainbow, like a meadow filled with flowers

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.400
With mouths as red as roots, smells like fragrance of roses

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.400
A row of forget-me-not in summer, as ground and sunflower growing

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.400
Like leaves falling in the autumn, I shine like daffodils

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:24.400
We love you mum, we love you mum You are a daffodils, growing in the spring morning

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:36.400
We love you mum, we love you mum You are the bluebirds, blooming in the fields

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:47.400
We love you mum, we love you mum Her face as yellow as the flowers in the garden

00:03:47.400 --> 00:04:00.400
We love you mum, we love you mum Pretty as a rose, falling like a rose, petals in spring

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.400
Thanks for watching!
