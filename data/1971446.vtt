00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
Lower town quayside is the original harbor.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.080
That was the medieval harbor.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.240
That was the harbor back in the 1700s.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.780
And that's where all the history is attached

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.920
because the pirates came in there,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.840
the smugglers came in there.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.360
And also then the French invasion

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.200
were trying to land in that port.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.440
The lower town harbor is a pretty place.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.440
It's been used as a location for making movies.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.400
They made the film Moby Dick there.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.480
They made the film Under Milk Wood there.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.520
So it's a pretty place.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.460
It's a nice location and gives you an indication

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.280
of what the town is really like.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.360
It's not a big place.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.200
It's a nice little harbor.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.460
It's pretty.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.680
It's got a lot of natural life there.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.440
It's an interesting place.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.220
It links quite well to that other,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.080
in upper town, the Gorseth.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.160
The Gorseth is a big stone circle,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.640
which is on the cliff top.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.280
And it looks down towards lower town.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.740
So that from the Gorseth,

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.360
you can then look along the line of the Preseli Hill.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.320
So you've got below you,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.120
if you look down about 40 degrees,

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.840
you have the harbor.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.960
But if you look up a bit,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.520
then you've got the Preseli Mountains.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.480
And the Preseli is where the blue stones come from.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.920
It's also the place where you've got

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.860
an awful lot of history that people are interested in.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.780
This is the big standing stones, the big dolmen.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.780
And these sites are easily available from Fishguard.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.300
You can see them from Fishguard.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.900
You can see the house that Black Bart lived in.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.300
That's on our list there.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.300
You've got lots of places you can see

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.660
from that one location.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.140
If you were coming into town,

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.580
that you could orientate yourself by going to the Gorseth,

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.700
that gives you a general orientation.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.540
These are the mountains,

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.620
these are the harbour.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.740
Then you could go down by bicycle or whatever

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.940
into the lower town harbor.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.060
And that's the pretty place.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.540
That's where you can get your close up

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.460
sort of experience of the town.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.420
So there's certainly very nice pubs there

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.340
and little places to go look at.
