00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
We talk rather blurtly about the lime heap and you can't really tell what we're talking about.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.160
Certain things that it wasn't the lime heap, it's a good story because

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.120
if you don't know it's the sharp bend at the very top of the Rear to Hilth.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.600
Many, many years ago, one of the farmers up there wanted a load of lime.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.060
Lime.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:27.940
Lime.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.840
So the carter brought the lime up and dumped it out in the field on that bend.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.040
Unfortunately, it was the wrong farm, the wrong field.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.240
And so then arose the problem what happened to the lime.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.080
Well the carter insisted that he had delivered it to where he was told to.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.200
The owner of the ground said it was absolutely nothing to do with him.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.320
The real owner of the ground also said it was in the wrong place so it was nothing to do with him.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.720
And so it stayed there and became known as the lime heap bend, the corner.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.760
And that's the high point of the hill there.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.640
And if you go through the gate and kick around in the ground you can still find evidence of the lime being there.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:30.480
There's all sorts of local names that mean something to those who are well initiated with them.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.200
But the newcomers completely and utterly battled.
