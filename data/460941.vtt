00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
So the long answer, that was a very long answer

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.080
to your question, right?

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.000
Very long answer.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.440
What I was trying to say was this.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.440
In those years, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83,

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.820
we learned a lot about how to present our case on television.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.240
And this was a strike that was in large part

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.100
handled through the medium of television.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.100
And the South Wales executive told me,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.100
you're gonna be our spokesman,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.100
you're gonna handle the press.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.480
And it was done with tremendous discipline.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.860
I mean, there were lots of people who were shouting

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.340
the odds about going back to work,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.900
and we've had enough of this,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.540
and Scargill's bloody useless,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.100
and we just belonged before the terrible deprivation

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.060
of the autumn and the winter.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.640
But we maintained the discipline and held the line.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.380
And it was all about having a real media strategy.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.300
That's what we did.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.180
Do you think that the miners' side was handled

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.580
as well as the government's side?

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.580
Yeah, I think so.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.060
The co-op of management were just rubbish.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.620
They were useless.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.980
And Phil Weeks was pretty good,

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.860
who was the director of the South Wales Call Field.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.660
He had a very nice way with him,

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.580
but he didn't like doing media.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.340
He could have been much more effective than he was,

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.860
but I think that's because Phil never really believed

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.000
in what the Call Board was doing.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.420
The bosses of the Call Board themselves came across

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.420
as out of touch, arrogant, grad grinds.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.460
Thatcher was pretty dreadful.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.140
Peter Walker was much more skillful.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.700
And in fact, they started to learn very quickly.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.920
We could see them getting better on the television.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.260
And they certainly beat us to the punch

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.780
by the Christmas and the New Year of the strike.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.220
And that really upset me.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.260
Scargill was a real enigma in a way.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.460
He was terrific, a morborator.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.260
And I've always hated morborators.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.100
I never trusted them, and I don't trust them, no.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.940
But he was...

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.460
And one of the most frightening things

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.260
I've ever been part of really was the huge rally

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.260
in Aberavon, in the hall in Aberavon.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.860
God, it was unbelievable.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.860
It was like one of these terrible totalitarian rallies.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.860
But he also had this other side to him,

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.860
which was a kind of inability to say things,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.780
which acknowledged that there was another argument.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.980
And that was a fatal weakness.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.240
What about the portrayals of the

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.440
miners themselves on television?

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.440
Was it a fair portrayal, do you think?

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.440
Oh, yeah, I think we had a very, very good media image.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.120
And that was partly because so many miners

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.440
are so articulate.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.240
They could express this stuff so beautifully

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.240
and in such a kind of apposite way.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.240
And I think that was a very, very good portrayal.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.400
In such a kind of apposite and timely way,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.440
they were good at it.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.920
And they would always be on almost every picket line,

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.960
certainly the kind of the big trouble spots.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.520
There'd always be somebody who was...

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.080
Ivor England, for example.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.960
Ivor was absolutely brilliant.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.160
Ivor had this genius of disguising the fact

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.560
that he was a highly intelligent guy

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.240
by sounding as if he just came out from the pit

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.320
and his mother hadn't let him out for 10 years or something.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.480
Well, I don't know what's going on here.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.520
I can't understand him.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.600
He just work in men who wanna work.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.640
He was brilliant.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.120
And Arfon Evans, who was the chairman of the Marty Lodge,

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.680
he was another one.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.720
But there were loads and loads of marvelous,

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.760
very articulate guys.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.760
And women, of course.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.720
I mean, God, some of the best explanations

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.960
of what this was about came from women.
