00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
Can you give me some idea of what you think Jewish values are, or what you think is important to Jewish people?

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.880
Family. I would say family life is the absolute crux of it,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:23.520
which then automatically makes one very loyal and community-minded.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:34.800
And I would have said that that is really, in a sense, the success of the Jew in getting on in the world,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.800
because he has the support of his family, who are willing to make sacrifices for him,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.400
and he in turn is willing to make sacrifices for the greater community.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:58.720
So there's a tremendous amount of inbuilt help, and that's really the essence of the success.
