00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.300
This is chapter 3 in our continuing project in relation to the race riots in Wales in

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:20.160
1919. Chapter 23. Bolshevism. The thing the Allies feared.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.280
The Russian Revolution was a period of political and social revolution across the territory

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.560
of the Russian Empire, commencing with the abolition of the monarchy in 1917 and concluding

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:39.920
in 1923 after the Bolshevik establishment of the Soviet Union, which included the national

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:49.120
states of Ukraine, Azerbaijan and others and the end of the civil war.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.920
The final collapse of the Russian monarchy began during the First World War with the

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:02.040
February 1917 revolution that was focused in and around Petrograd, which is now St.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.720
Petersburg, and at the time was the capital of Russia. This revolution erupted in the

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:16.240
context of Russia's major military losses during the war, which resulted in much of

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.880
the Russian army being ready to mutiny. In the chaos, members of the Duma, Russia's

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.720
parliament assumed control of the country, forming the Russian Provisional Government.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.760
This was dominated by the interests of large capitalists and the noble aristocracy, even

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:44.760
though the monarchy had lost control. Grassroots community assemblies, called Soviets,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.760
which were dominated by soldiers and the urban industrial working class, initially permitted

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.560
the Provisional Government to rule. But the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, gained

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.640
substantial influence in the Soviets. Lenin campaigned for an immediate end of Russia's

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.440
participation in the war, granting land to the peasants and providing bread to the urban

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.240
workers. When the Provisional Government chose to continue fighting the war with Germany,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:24.120
the Bolsheviks and other socialist factions used that to advance the revolution further.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.120
The term Bolshevik, by the way, comes from the Russian word Bolshinsvo, which means majority.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.800
The Bolsheviks ultimately became the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Bolsheviks,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.800
or Reds, came to power in Russia during the October Revolution phase of the Russian Revolution

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.800
in 1917, and they founded the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, RSFSR. The

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:04.440
derogatory terms we often now hear for workers come from the West's feeling about that group.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.440
Terms such as Bolsheviks, workers, Reds, or Pinkos. The revolutions of 1917 to 1923 were

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.600
a revolutionary wave that included political unrest and revolts around the world, inspired

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.480
by the success of the Russian Revolution and the disorder created by the aftermath of World

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:38.520
War I. The uprisings were mainly socialist or anti-colonial in nature. Many attempted

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:45.720
socialist revolts failed to have a long-term impact. The Bolsheviks actively sought to

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:52.720
encourage and support these revolts, including active participation in the British trade

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.840
unions via the Communist Party. Many French soldiers mutinied in 1917 and refused to join

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.440
the enemy. In Bulgaria, many troops mutinied and the Bulgarian Tsar stepped down. Mass

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000
strikes and mutinies occurred in Austria, Hungary, and the Habsburg Monarchy, and it

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:24.080
collapsed. In Germany, the November Revolution of 1918 threatened to overtake Germany, but

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:31.080
eventually failed because the army decided to support the government. The German army

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:39.080
faced various mass strikes. Greece succumbed to a coup d'etat in 1922. Turkey experienced

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:46.640
a successful war of independence. Across the world, various other protests and revolts

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:53.920
occurred from the turmoil of World War I and the success of the Russian Revolution. In

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:01.200
the UK, the trade union, Triple Alliance, was a real concern for the British government.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.560
They felt strongly that the unions were being affected by Bolsheviks within. Before the

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:13.560
war, the mines, railways, and docks had been privately owned, but in 1914, under a threat

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:20.560
of war, they were nationalized. This meant in 1919, the three most powerful groups of

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.560
workers, the Triple Alliance, were actually working for the state. These workers had

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.000
been receiving a bonus during the war and had increased their working hours, but the

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000
wages were reduced in 1919. In February 1919, the three union leaders from the three main

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Triple Alliance groups, that's coal, rail, transport, and docks, were invited to attend

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Downing Street to have tea with Prime Minister Lloyd George. Strikes had doubled after the

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
war across all industries, including teaching, and the government could not be sure the army

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
would suppress action. After all, the army was not going to be able to suppress action.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000
The army itself had succumbed to various mutinies. According to the miners' representative,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000
according to one of the delegates, Robert Smiley, which was confirmed by Aneurin Bevan,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
the Prime Minister said the following to them,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000
His argument was simple and clear at a time when states were near collapse across Europe.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.000
If the unions won, the state and government would collapse. So would the Triple Alliance

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
be ready for a collapse of authority that meant they would effectively be in charge,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000
be the government? At that point, the leaders of the unions were made fully aware that if

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
they wanted Bolshevism, it was theirs. But this was not a vision they wanted. They were

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
simply negotiating for better conditions and wages, and their positions rested on their

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000
relationship with government and employers. So they went back to their unions, not wanting

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000
the government to collapse. The railway workers had demanded a strike by March. The railway

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
executive had refused the National Union of Railway Workers' demands, prompting the union's

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.000
special general meeting, SGM, to express its quote, utmost disgust, unquote, and to vote

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:14.000
43 to 19 to ask the Triple Alliance partners to make a decision.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000
The NUR leaders were not keen on this course of action, and together with the Trans War

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and miners union leaders decided against the national strike. Instead they met the Minister,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Bonne Law, who made some concessions to the railwaymen, guaranteed working hours, minimum

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000
rest period, and a weeks paid holiday. On the 27th of March, the NUR special general

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.000
meeting voted 41 to 19 not to go ahead with strikes because of progressing talks, a phrase

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.000
familiar to rail union members to this day. Those talks would continue for six months,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
while the government prepared to defeat the inevitable strike, but the union leaders prepared

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:10.000
to avoid it rather than win it. Like the NUR, the miners federation let the government persuade

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
it to postpone action. Lloyd George appointed the Sankey Commission to investigate working

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:24.000
conditions and ownership of the coal industry, promising to implement its findings. After

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000
a preliminary report on 20th of May, the Sankey report delivered its full verdict on 20th of

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000
June, favoring nationalization, a 20% pay rise and one hour off the miners working day.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000
A month later, the government had taken only one measure, announcing that the maximum time

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000
that miners were to work underground would be cut from eight to seven hours. The miners

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000
federation did not act, still trusting the government to honor the Sankey report, but

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
rank and file members were not so naive and patient. In mid July, an unofficial strike

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.000
spread from Kent and South Wales to Staffordshire, Derbyshire, Yorkshire, the Northeast and Scotland,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000
but without the support of their union, who held strike funds, the strikes came to an

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.000
end in mid August. However, none of this helped black people because the unions wanted their

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000
jobs and they were a useful target for disillusioned workers. One of the reasons there was not

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
enough work was the high number of strikes crippling an already damaging economy. The

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
relatively few jobs taken by black people would have made little difference to the high

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000
level of post-war unemployment. However, the fear of them being radicalized was a different

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
matter for the government. For that reason, controlling them and removing them was something

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000
the government was in favor of. The problem was the legislative position made that difficult.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:08.000
They were British citizens, but in an environment where the press placed the blame fully upon

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:15.000
black people, the riots provided the smokescreen of public demand. This smokescreen would be

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:23.000
commonly used from 1919 onward by the British government.
